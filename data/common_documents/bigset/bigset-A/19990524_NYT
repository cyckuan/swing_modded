 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Lakers are built on glitz and
high-profile glamour, but Sunday afternoon they went the way of all
flash.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs completed their four-game sweep of the
Western Conference semifinals, pounding the Lakers 118-107 before
17,505 in the last game at the Great Western Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shut down the Forum, baby!'' shouted the Spurs' Mario Elie.
``That's all I wanted. We'll be the answer to a trivia question one
day: `Which team won the last game on the Forum floor?' It was the
Spurs, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who move into the Staples Center next season, might
be the answer to another trivia question: ``What is perhaps the
most talented team not to win the NBA title in 1999?''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, baby. And that's just how the Lakers played much of
this season, like babies. Like immature children, the Lakers spent
most of the season refusing to play well together or share the
basketball. And like children to the end, they apparently were
anxious to get on with their summer vacation as soon as possible,
not even bothering to put up much of a fight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs advance to the conference finals for the first time
since 1995 and will play the winner of the Utah-Portland series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as emotional as I was years ago (in 1995) in this
situation,'' said Avery Johnson, who finished with 19 points and 10
assists Sunday. ``It's good to go back, and I'm excited, but I'm
not as excited as I was a couple of years ago because that was my
first time (in the conference finals).
</P>
<P>
   ``But now the goals are a lot higher. We're thankful to be here,
but we have a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As do the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of three All-Star-caliber players _
Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice _ the Lakers were swept
aside by the Spurs, who are all meat and potatoes _ or carne y
papas, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been so many great Lakers teams over the years, so
this is kind of sad in a way, too, that they won't be playing here
again,'' said the Spurs' Jerome Kersey, who scored all nine of his
points in the fourth quarter. ``There are a lot of ghosts here.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, and if you listen hard enough, beyond the pulsing Laker
Girl dance beats and the pounding O'Neal rap rhythms, you can
almost hear those spirits of Lakers past having a good, long laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers thought they had exorcised all those recent playoff
ghosts with a purge that began after getting swept by Utah in last
season's conference finals. Gone from that team _ which won 61
regular-season games _ are Nick Van Exel, Eddie Jones, Elden
Campbell and coach Del Harris, and they must be enjoying a good,
long laugh at the Lakers' expense.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps so is Dennis Rodman _ if he's even paying attention,
which he didn't do during his 23-game stint with the Lakers this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The home crowd made sure the Lakers remembered, taunting the
team with chants of ``Eddie, Eddie,'' recalling Jones, who, along
with Campbell, was dealt to Charlotte for Rice.
</P>
<P>
   All that maneuvering, and the Lakers still are reading headlines
that no doubt will scream, ``Four-gone conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   And those superstars were knocked out not only by Tim Duncan's
33 points and 14 rebounds, but by Jaren Jackson, who scored nine of
his 20 points in the fourth quarter, and Kersey's big final period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge team effort,'' Duncan said. ``People kept coming
off the bench and doing things for us that we needed them to do.
People just stepped into their roles and did the things that they
needed to do throughout the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers closed the third period with a 12-0 run that cut a
14-point San Antonio lead to 86-84 entering the final quarter. But
instead of staggering, the Spurs staged a clinic, scoring the first
13 points of the period, going ahead 99-84 with 8:26 remaining on
Jackson's 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   It was a jog to the finish line from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set a certain tone for this team all season,'' said David
Robinson, who had 12 points, seven rebounds and two blocks. ``It's
not luck. You just go out there and execute and get it done. But
that's the way we've been playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the game was close down the stretch, well, we've won
every close game down the stretch. You just believe in yourself,
and you begin to understand that we can win every one of these
games.''
</P>
<P>
   It's starting to look as though O'Neal is destined to lose every
one of these games. Sunday marked the fifth time in six playoff
seasons that O'Neal has been sent home via sweep, and he wasn't any
happier this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like feeling like this,'' said O'Neal, who finished
with 36 points and 14 rebounds but missed 11 of his 23 free throws.
``Right now, I'm very upset and very disappointed. It's very
embarrassing. Every time I get sent home, I get embarrassed. I hate
saying, `Well, we played hard.' No, now it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's over for the Lakers, and it was accomplished by a team
that was built, not bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``That feels great,'' said Elie of knocking off the Lakers'
high-priced talent. ``I thought (Spurs coach Gregg) Popovich did a
good job of putting the right guys here. I felt that with the
Spurs, it was never talent with them _ it was just the mental
(toughness). And he brought in some guys _ myself, Jerome Kersey
and Steve Kerr _ who have been here before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a special group here. These guys like each other. We
have no egos, and nobody worries about the stat sheet. Everybody
just worries about wins and losses on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder if the Lakers worry about the same things. &QL;

6 `WIZ' KIDS, 150 WHIZZES AT BEING KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The happy dance was the best part.
</P>
<P>
   During that segment of the audition, the kids were no longer
would-be actors trying for parts. They were just kids again,
throwing their hands into the air, twirling and laughing while
singing, ``Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a song that sticks easily and firmly in your head every
time you hear it. With more than 150 kids trying out for six roles
as munchkins in a touring production of ``The Wizard of Oz'' that
will play at Gammage Auditorium next month, it must have been
permanently carved into the brains of the people picking the
pint-size performers for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Not every kid who showed up at Wells Fargo Arena on the Arizona
State University campus last week to audition carried a
professional resume and glossy glamour shots, but enough did to
remind you that just because the roles were diminutive didn't mean
the ambitions were.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Klein, 9, waited three hours to be first in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a marine biologist or a pediatrician,'' she said
as she affixed an adhesive badge with a ``1'' on it to her
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   What? Not an actor?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that would be if I didn't become an actor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle's dad, Michael, is a rare bird at this kind of thing _
he's honest about his role in the process. &QL; 
PARENTS IN THE WINGS
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an admitted stage parent,'' he said. ``I take her around
to all the auditions and pictures, you name it. Somebody's got to
take her.''
</P>
<P>
   Good for him. Those words _ ``stage parent'' _ are pure poison
to most people, dredging up visions of a claw-fingered harpy
shoving a reluctant, crying child out from behind the curtain and
into the spotlight toward reflected fame and glory.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't how Klein portrayed himself, and, frankly, it wasn't
how he seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to talk her out of it,'' he said, referring to acting,
``but she refused. She's a little ham.''
</P>
<P>
   Again with the honesty. Which is not to say others lied about
their children's ambitions or, more to the point, their own. Lisa
Stark brought Kurt, 11, to the audition because ``he saw it on the
news and wanted to do it.'' No resume, no photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his deal, not mine,'' she said. Like the rest of the
kids, Kurt had dutifully memorized the wicked-witch song.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have his song memorized now,'' Lisa Stark said. No doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Acting experience _ and ambition _ varied among the kids waiting
to go on. Marcus Vizzerra, a 9-year-old dressed sharply in a vest,
gave a simple reason why he would make a good munchkin:
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm short.''
</P>
<P>
   (Marcus, too, had the song down cold. As did his mother,
Melissa. ``I was singing that song in my sleep last night,'' she
said.) &QL; 
THINKING CAP
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Hofferth, meanwhile, sported a green leprechaun hat, which
suggested a munchkinlike look, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use it . . . just to get more in the feel of acting,'' the
12-year-old said of his hat. ``And to get people's attention _ like
yours.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the room where the kids auditioned was where the biggest
differences were found. Allison Queal, a munchkin, citizen of Oz
and flying monkey in the touring company, taught the children a
simple dance step, which they performed in groups of five while
singing the witch song.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, any kid singing, ``Wake up you sleepy head/Rub
your eyes, get out of bed'' while clomping around (the happy dance)
is cute. But some moved uncomfortably and awkwardly, as if they
were wearing wet clothes. Others wore the steely eyed glint and
professional grins of seasoned pros as they moved fluidly.
</P>
<P>
   None of the kids you've been reading about made the final cut.
But that's OK. They looked positively gleeful doing the happy
dance.
</P>
<P>
   Which is more important anyway. &QL;

GUIDES AT TALIESIN WEST GIVE INSIGHT TO GREAT ARCHITECT OF 20TH
CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   make one thing clear: This is not Kitty Hawk, N.C., and Frank
Lloyd Wright is not one of the fathers of modern aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the misconceptions of some tourists, this Wright was one
of the great architects of the 20th century, and some rank him at
the very top. His legacy is the vision that led America away from
the European model of the 19th century and his ability to endure
and thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Wright died in 1959 at 92 after a career that spanned 70 years.
Each time the architectural community tried to retire him, he
rebounded with a new idea, a new vision. He was the original
Comeback Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to last fall's public television series, ``Frank
Lloyd Wright,'' by documentarian Ken Burns, interest has boomed in
such Wright enclaves as Taliesin West, the winter counterpart to
his summertime Taliesin in Spring Green, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   National broadcast of the Burns program and the filmmaker's
appearance at a Taliesin event last fall have brought an influx of
visitors to the Scottsdale facility, where Wright lived from 1937
until his death 22 years later.
</P>
<P>
   But the boom had begun even before the documentary aired,
according to Suzette Lucas, Taliesin West director of external
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a 25 to 30 percent increase over the last three to
four years,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Tours once offered only during the morning in summer have proved
surprisingly popular when offered in the afternoon, as well. More
local residents are discovering the charm of the historic landmark
that sits in their backyard, while out-of-town guests continue to
make up the bulk of the center's many walking tours.
</P>
<P>
   Summer hours begin June 1.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to regular one-hour, 90-minute and three-hour tours,
two new tours are being offered this summer.
</P>
<P>
   At peak season, Taliesin can see as many as 12,000 guests pass
through its portals in a month. Even in summer, visitors still
number around 4,500 monthly. May's totals this year are expected to
reach 9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous tours are offered each day, including the ``Panorama''
tour, which begins at 9 a.m., 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. every day during
the summer, or more often if attendance is heavy. It includes a
visit to the Cabaret Cinema, Music Pavilion, Seminar theater and
Wright's private office, all against the backdrop of the Sonoran
Desert.
</P>
<P>
   For architecture buffs, students and professionals, Taliesin
West ``is almost a pilgrimage,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's unconventional designs were considered the foundation
of American architecture, which finally broke away from the fussy
European, Victorian style of the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   His philosophy emphasized creating buildings and dwellings in
harmony with their surroundings. At Taliesin West, he and
apprentices enrolled at the Frank Lloyd Wright School of
Architecture carried that notion one step further, actually
building the walls of the structures from the stone that forms the
floor of the Sonoran Desert.
</P>
<P>
   True to Wright's vision, Taliesin West's most striking
characteristic is its location at the heart of 600 acres of virgin
desert landscape. The vistas are simply breathtaking. Before
suburban development, visitors could have seen as far as 60 miles,
a guide reports.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Wright stuff necessarily varied from project to
project as befitted its environment, Taliesin West evokes the
familiar geometric Wright, with sharp angles and straight lines
executed in rich woods and textural stone.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast the structures here with Arizona State University's
Wright-designed Gammage Auditorium in Tempe, which is softer and
more curvilinear.
</P>
<P>
   Another myth your tour guide will be happy to debunk: Wright did
not design the Arizona Biltmore hotel in Phoenix. But he did act as
a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Taliesin guides are knowledgeable and eager to discuss the man
and his work. Tours are comfortable, exploring the property indoors
and outdoors, with a chance to sit in Wright-designed furniture. On
hot days, tourgoers are invited to borrow an umbrella to screen the
sun and encouraged to intake ample amounts of water before
venturing out.
</P>
<P>
   The gift shop is well-stocked with Wright merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Even visitors who arrive with just a smattering of knowledge
about Wright will leave knowing him better and with an appreciation
for the philosophy that brings mother nature into man-made
structures.
</P>
<P>
   Those elements are clear at Taliesin West, which, your guide
will point out, is not a museum but a working school of
architecture that accepts only 1 percent of hand-picked applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a beautiful setting, relating to the desert in a
civilized way,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   And she's quick to answer the question before another tourist
can ask: No, neither of the Wright brothers ever lived at Taliesin
West.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it was Frank Lloyd Wright's imagination that took flight. &QL;

RED SOX STRIKE NICE BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BLUE JAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ OK, it's a little early to put these Red Sox on a
pedestal. But you have to admit the Olde Towne Team earned some
bragging rights with series victories in the last six days over the
Yankees and Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox exploded for 13 hits Sunday at Fenway Park and
closed out a 5-1 homestand with a 10-8 victory and a sweep of a
youthful and talented Toronto team. Although he worked only six
innings, Pedro Martinez won his ninth game in 10 decisions as the
offense picked him up for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Boston won for the 14th time in its last 17 games with hitting,
pitching, and defense. Besides Martinez, Tom Gordon picked up his
50th straight save, and home runs by Damon Buford and Jason Varitek
accounted for four runs in the fifth inning to break a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez prevailed despite a shortened pitch count imposed by
the Red Sox (he threw 96). He allowed three runs on eight hits,
struck out six, and walked one. Manager Jimy Williams was tossed
from a game for the first time this season, but it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well against two tough teams,'' said Williams. ``Of
course, we have a long way to go. We pitched good overall and we
played good defense. We got some timely hits. That's what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids compete good together. They pull for each other. It
really doesn't surprise me that Damon had the game he did today. Or
Trot Nixon or John Valentin had the games they had on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   It must have come as a surprise to a crowd of 28,559 that
Toronto was able to overcome deficits of 2-0 and 3-2 to tie
Martinez. Boston's ace had averaged 130 pitches in his previous
five starts and 10.8 strikeouts. So after the Sox took a 7-3 lead
in the fifth, they had Martinez work one more inning and turned it
over to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The pen struggled, but the Sox won anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect him to throw a shutout and strike out 15
hitters every game,'' said Williams. ``They have professional
hitters on the other side. We've asked Pedro to pitch a lot of
pitches in many consecutive starts. I think we got him under 100
this time. To me, it just tells you how good he is when he can go
out and compete like that and get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Martinez's streak of at least one strikeout
in 33 consecutive innings was halted. The early exit cost him a
chance to extend his 10-plus strikeout streak to eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to give the team a chance to win,'' Martinez said.
``And today I did a little bit less than the other times and they
pulled it out. I wasn't struggling. They made some adjustments and
had some good at-bats. I still made some good pitches. I wasn't
concerned about the number of strikeouts I have in a game. I'd
rather get two ground balls and a popup. That'll help me somewhere
along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Buford's homer came off former Cy Young Award winner Pat Hentgen
(4-2) with two out in the fifth. Troy O'Leary hustled down the line
and just beat the throw on a hard grounder to third, a play on
which Toronto's Tony Fernandez was charged with an error. Mike
Stanley singled past short, then Buford jumped on an 0-1 fastball
for the homer to left and a 6-3 lead. Moments later, Varitek hit
homer No. 4 to put Boston ahead, 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox got three more runs in the eighth, but Toronto scored
two in the seventh and three in the ninth. The tying run was at the
plate when Gordon came on. Three pitches later, Homer Bush flied to
right and the Sox had a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to hit a home run,'' said Buford. ``There were
people on base and I just tried to drive in some runs. I'm just one
person. We have a lot of good players on the team. It's not
something we talk about as a team. But we know we've played well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good team,'' said Martinez. ``We're getting used to
winning and competing, doing the little things. That's going to
help us. I don't see any big hero. It's always somebody (different)
who sticks out.''

LIGHTNING BOLT KILLS FIREFIGHTER IN OWN BACK YARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. _ A U.S. Forest Service firefighter was struck
and killed by lightning as a pair of rare spring thunderstorms
pummeled Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Culbertson, 47, was in the back yard of his home in
Palmdale, 62 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, about 7 a.m. when
lightning struck a nearby cottonwood tree. The bolt burned an
entrance hole into the man's shoulder, and left him with electrical
burns on his chest, back, side and arms, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was probably out there watching the lightning, but nobody
really knows,'' said Los Angeles County sheriff's Sgt. Steve
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning bolts continued to strike nearby as paramedics worked
on the stricken man, who was moved into a garage and out of the
rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple strikes _ probably within 100 feet _ in some
of the vacant fields around there,'' firefighter-paramedic Scott
Clark said. ``He had a viable (heart) rhythm, but by the time we
got him to the hospital he was pronounced dead after about 10
minutes of them working him up.''
</P>
<P>
   The power-packed thunderstorms also knocked out electricity at
thousands of homes as they swept across Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The pair of storms rumbled out of the area's High Desert
beginning about 3 a.m. and rolled from the northeast to the
southwest and then off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   The rain contributed to more than 300 crashes on Southern
California highways Sunday morning, more than double the number
reported for the same period a day earlier, said Officer Frank
Sansone of the California Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest rain was reported in Glendale, nine miles north of
downtown L.A., where 0.45 inch fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty unusual. We don't see them too often, especially
strong ones like these, over our area. These were pretty big
storms,'' said Stuart Seto, weather specialist for the National
Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the (spotters) said if you look at the calendar you
wouldn't think it was time for rain anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The storms were generated by a low-pressure area that moved west
from the California-Nevada border and became unstable, lifting
moisture and generating clouds and thunderstorms, Seto explained.

A NOVEL APPROACH BY KNICKS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Knicks aren't a soap opera. Uh-uh. They're a
full-blown Gothic novel.
</P>
<P>
   With eight games left in the regular season they were 21-21 and
in very legitimate danger of missing the playoffs. More than one
local scribe was suggesting that Latrell Sprewell was bored and
thoroughly disinterested. The coach was said to have the job
security of an Italian premier.
</P>
<P>
   Jump to the playoffs. If Allan Houston doesn't get the bounce of
his life last Sunday they would have lost to Miami and Jeff Van
Gundy would have been an ex-coach. But his last-second jumper hit
the rim, bounced up off the glass, and fell through the net. New
York 78, Miami 77. Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Where are we now? Well, we are, in all likelihood, one game away
from a sweep of the Atlanta Hawks. Next Sunday the Knicks will meet
the Pacers for the fifth year in a row, this time for the right to
represent the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals. The Knicks made
it three straight Sunday with an authoritative 90-78 dispatch of
the outmanned Hawks. But was that _ is that _ the big story in New
York today? Noooo. That would be too simple.
</P>
<P>
   The story is that someone in a position to know has admitted
that stories Sunday claiming that the Knicks had been holding
secret talks with Phil Jackson before the season was over were
accurate. Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts, a devout
Mormon, does not attend Sunday games, but MSG public relations
representative Barry Watkins confirmed that the Knicks had been
conversing with Jackson, Doc Rivers, and Dave Cowens, as well.
What? Whoopi Goldberg's not interested?
</P>
<P>
   All this raises Van Gundy to about an 11 on the sympathy meter,
at least in the eyes of the local media. The sad-eyed mentor, who
always has had major support within the team, now is being
portrayed in terms that would have made Mother Teresa blush. About
all this, he, of course, says nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But Lenny Wilkens wasn't afraid to speak up when asked what he
thought of the controversy swirling about his coaching rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he shouldn't worry about it,'' Wilkens said, ``and I
don't think he is. When your captain (Patrick Ewing) comes out and
says he's behind you 100 percent, you just go out and do your
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people are less forgiving. They want to know why it took
Van Gundy so long to recognize what Sprewell and Marcus Camby could
do for the team. These two have become The Story. When this pair
enters the game, everything changes. The Knicks get friskier,
quicker, more athletic, and more energetic. They actually become
something of a transition team (three straight second-period fast
breaks, if you can believe that). More importantly, they have
become a winning team.
</P>
<P>
   They are, at present, precisely the type of team departed
general manager Ernie Grunfeld hoped they'd be when he a) signed
Sprewell and b) traded Charles Oakley for Camby. But he lost his
power struggle with the coach, who was very cautious with Sprewell
and openly critical of Camby. Wherever Ernie is, and when last seen
he was scouting European talent, he must be smirking. The truth is
that he was right and the coach was wrong. Now he's out of a job he
has been proven to have done well and the coach looks secure.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happens when the ultimate stakes are a $1 million
net for every playoff home game. The suits get very itchy.
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is going on here? How have the Knicks, almost a
textbook dysfunctional family with less than three weeks remaining
in the regular season, moved to within a game of the conference
final?
</P>
<P>
   ``We just started to play better,'' offered Van Gundy.
``Sometimes people try to make it more complex than it is. We've
become more unselfish. And, let's face it, we've had some breaks
along the way. If that ball had not bounded in last week, we
wouldn't be talking about this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I'm surprised,'' said backup center Chris Dudley,
whose 14 points and 12 rebounds were both playoff highs. ``But I
wouldn't have predicted it. We knew coming into the season that we
had talent. But, as you know, in the middle of the season we
weren't jelling. We had new faces. We had limited practice time.
Latrell was hurt in the beginning and couldn't practice. You just
didn't know when it was all going to click in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were 21-21, we knew we had to win six of eight to make
the playoffs. We had a couple of days off, and we worked hard. We
won those six of eight, and that helped pull us together. That was
the beginning of our playoffs, and we've been playing well since
then.''
</P>
<P>
   At many junctures during the season people said this abundance
of talent thing was a myth. As Van Gundy pointed out Sunday, Ewing
hasn't been truly healthy for two years. Larry Johnson has been
transformed from a rugged low post player into a dainty spot-up
3-point shooter. Charlie Ward isn't very good, period. Houston and
Camby were said to be soft. Dudley is an offensive liability.
Sprewell didn't give a damn. Kurt Thomas was a flake. Chris Childs
was a $4-million-a-year backup. Have I left anyone out?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, Herb Williams is so old he gets a senior discount at
the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   And now? It's one-for-all and all-for-one. It's all lovey-dovey,
and can I open the door for you? The bench is now a huge asset, and
we're told it's all because they're such selfless people. ``The
four guys who come off the bench regularly (Sprewell, Camby,
Dudley, and Childs) have all sacrificed,'' Van Gundy said.
``They've all started in this league, and they're making huge
sacrifices.''
</P>
<P>
   Pass the Kleenex. What's happening is that in the short run the
Knicks are winning, and these people are (usually) keeping their
mouths shut. Fine. But this is New York, and this is corporate
America, and you never know where and when you need the pooper
scooper. How convenient that double Oscar winner William Goldman
sits right behind the basket. Watching this team should keep him in
screenplay ideas for the next 10 years.

SINGING PRAISES OF BIRD 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Larry Bird is unlike any coach in the NBA. That's
not to say he is the best. He's just different. There are many
reasons for that. One of them has to do with a word that will cause
any coach to rant. We are talking about ``distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as Bird remains in Indiana and has ``Coach'' before his
name, he never will have to worry about distractions. Ever. That's
why it shouldn't be surprising that his Pacers are undefeated in
the playoffs _ 7-0 _ after Sunday's 89-86 Eastern Conference
semifinal win over the 76ers. The Sixers have existed for 36 years
and never had been swept out of a seven-game series. If they want
to talk with a peer group about their historic problems, they can
call the Bucks, who also were swept by the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Bird has the Pacers thinking and winning like no other team in
the franchise's 23-year history. This is the first time the Pacers
have won seven straight playoff games. It is the first time they
truly believe they belong in the Finals, rather than the
(conference) finals. Bird is constantly putting things in
perspective for his players, even when he isn't directly speaking
to them.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, a reporter asked Bird about Reggie Miller's
focus. Bird said that his shooting guard was special. The
questioner, obviously not having a good mental day, asked the coach
if he ever has seen a player focus like Miller. That's crazy, isn't
it? Bird easily could have said, ``Yep. I look at him in the mirror
every day.'' He didn't. He paused long enough for the obvious to
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   If you are enjoying this rare Bird, I would advise you to tape
the Pacers' remaining playoff games and freeze these memories. If
this team wins the NBA title, I am convinced that Bird will walk
away, peacefully, from coaching. Forget about the three-year
contract he signed in 1997. He can stay with the Pacers, in any
capacity, as long as he wants. But it is obvious that all he wants
to do is win one championship. With no distractions, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked us last year if we wanted him to come back,'' Antonio
Davis said Sunday. ``We looked at him like he was crazy and said,
`Yeah we want you to come back. We want you to lead us one more
time and see if we can win a championship.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They have made it clear that they like the way he leads. They
like the fact that he can talk basketball with Pat Riley, Jerry
Sloan, and Chuck Daly. They also like it that he could stop talking
and take all of those coaches to any of the nation's asphalt hoop
courts and dominate them in a pickup game. Even more important, if
all the league's coaches went on a silent retreat, you can be sure
Bird would be the last one to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers went through an awful, 10-minute scoring drought in
the third and fourth quarters Sunday. They watched their 12-point
lead with two minutes left in the third become a 1-point deficit
with two minutes to play. The 20,844 fans here sensed a win. Bird
didn't. He may be from Indiana, but he didn't want to go back there
for a fifth game. So what if the Pacers probably would have gone on
to win the series, four games to one? Another game would have meant
another round of practices, another round of interviews, and
another delay in what the Pacers ultimately want. Those, friends,
are also known as distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really not a hollerer or a screamer,'' said Mark Jackson,
who had 14 points and 13 assists Sunday. ``A lot of coaches _ with
the fourth quarter the Sixers put on _ probably would have called
12 timeouts and cursed us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird talked strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have to be screaming all the time,'' Chris Mullin
said. ``It may be a little different style than what guys are used
to, but it's probably more effective. Larry was like that as a
player. He wasn't always a guy you heard in the paper, but I know
he was a guy you heard in practice. He talked to you through
action, by busting your butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I have no problem telling you that when I look at the
Pacers on paper, there is no excitement. Miller is a great shooter.
Jackson makes terrific passes. The people who are supposed to
rebound usually do it. But the only sexy thing about this team is
that 7-0 playoff record.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at us and it's pretty much like that girl at the club
who doesn't look good initially, but does at about 2, 3 in the
morning,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   A fashion editor from GQ magazine is not going to call the
Pacers Tuesday and ask for a player to be part of a photo shoot.
Sunday, Rik Smits stepped on the court with knee-high black socks.
You haven't seen anti-fashion until you've seen a 7-foot-4-inch man
in shorts with black socks pulled to his knees. You won't see many
Pacers on MTV or BET. Travis Best and Miller had roles in Spike
Lee's ``He Got Game,'' but they had minimal parts.
</P>
<P>
   Bird and his team share the same basketball soul. They speak
only when necessary. As straightforward as Bird has been during
these playoffs, I have a feeling he will have a lot of interesting
things to say when his book, ``Bird Watching'' _ authored by former
Globe writer Jackie MacMullan _ is released in September. Certain
members of the Celtics' organization (are you reading this, Paul
Gaston?) should be nervous about the book's contents.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Pacers, they answer all criticisms about their style
by winning. If they beat the Knicks in the conference finals, they
will set a franchise record for playoff wins (11). Sunday, the
chalkboard in their locker room read ``NEXT!!!'' Beneath it,
someone wrote, ``8 Mo','' a reference to the number of wins they
need for a title. Before they left the court, they caught the
glimmer of Ron Harper's championship ring. The Bull was sitting
near their bench. A fan asked, ``Ron, can I see your ring?'' Harper
held up his hand and said of the Pacers, ``I don't know who will
win the championship, but they should.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, we'll be talking about former Pacers coach
Larry Bird.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN FRANCISCO _ Jeff Bagwell should come with a warning label:
Handle with care.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe that would have kept rookie reliever Joe Nathan from
setting off an explosion Sunday at 3Com Park. Bagwell's three-run
homer in the seventh inning broke open a tie game and sent the
Astros on their way to a 4-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's blast provided the requisite run support for Jose Lima
to become the National League's first eight-game winner. It also
kept the Astros from getting swept in the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this is why they say baseball is a funny game,'' said
Bagwell, who was 1-for-4. ``I had a really bad day and basically
(was) hurting our club. I guess you can say I'm relieved to be
having the day I was having and end up hitting a three-run homer in
a game we win 4-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his clutch homer, it was clear Bagwell wasn't satisfied
with his performance _ particularly the fact he failed twice with
runners in scoring position and less than two out.
</P>
<P>
   But that was an aberration. Bagwell has been money with runners
in scoring position, hitting .362 in those situations this year. He
has 44 RBIs in the Astros' 42 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were 3-3 on the road trip, but it is scary to think
where they might have been without Bagwell, who hit .400 and drove
in nine of the Astros' 25 runs on the six-game jaunt to Los Angeles
and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lima extended his major-league-best winning streak to eight
games and improved to 24-9 since Astros manager Larry Dierker put
him into the starting rotation last season. The Astros have a .690
winning percentage in games started by Lima over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old righthander has evolved into quite a pitcher
since his days with the Detroit Tigers, with whom he was 8-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Houston Astros got kind of a find when they brought Jose
Lima into the organization,'' Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Lima has become the closest thing to a sure win that the Astros
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest difference in what has happened to me is that they
gave me opportunity,'' Lima said. ``I got a chance, bro. That's the
biggest difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima made sure the Giants didn't have a chance. After giving up
a leadoff homer to Marvin Benard in the first inning, Lima allowed
only one runner to reach scoring position for the remainder of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Lima retired 11 of the last 14 batters he faced, and Billy
Wagner pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his 12th save. It was
Wagner's first save since May 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really needed to get this win,'' said Astros second baseman
Craig Biggio, who hit his National League-leading 19th double in
the game. ``We had some tough games on this trip, and we haven't
always had the best of luck on the West Coast. Any time we can go
3-3 on this trip, I'll take that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros drew six walks in the game, none more crucial than
the back-to-back free passes Nathan issued to Lima and Biggio to
start the seventh inning. After Nathan struck out Russ Johnson,
Bagwell took him to a 3-2 count. Instead of pitching around Bagwell
_ Derek Bell (0-for-4) was on deck _ Nathan decided to challenge
the Astros slugger.
</P>
<P>
   As Bagwell's Astrodome theme music says: ``Tick, tick, tick,
tick _ boom!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at 3-2 three times before that,'' Bagwell said. ``I
struck out twice and walked. If the guy pitches around me and walks
me, it's bases loaded with one out. Nathan throws 95, 96 mph. When
you throw that hard, you challenge people.''
</P>
<P>
   Benard's homer was the second Lima had allowed in a span of
three innings, dating to his last start. Prior to that, Lima had
pitched 37 innings without allowing a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lima got the best of us today,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker
said. ``He wasn't 7-1 for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros put runners in scoring position with fewer than two
outs in each of the first three innings, but Giants starter Shawn
Estes held them off each time. Estes retired seven consecutive
batters at one point but found himself in trouble again in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Bagwell drew back-to-back walks to lead off the
inning, and Johnson scored from second on Richard Hidalgo's
broken-bat single over shortstop Rich Aurilia's head. It was a
breakthrough hit for Hidalgo, who had not driven in a run since May
12.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros tied the score but missed a chance to claim the lead
after Estes walked Carl Everett to load the bases with one out.
Baker signaled reliever Jerry Spradlin into the game, and the
hard-throwing righthander proceeded to strike out Tony Eusebio and
coaxed a weak liner from Tim Bogar to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Giants, that was the last bullet they
would dodge.

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If Major League Soccer expects to survive, it
will have to do better than this. The Los Angeles Galaxy continued
to struggle offensively and at the gate, but performed well enough
to take a 1-0 win over the Revolution Sunday &UR;  &LR; night before an
announced crowd of 7,581 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere around a Galaxy game has changed drastically as
the team has discarded Hispanic stars, and its attack has
floundered. The relationship between the Galaxy and fans seems to
have been critically altered, and the attendance was so small that
the spectators could not possibly hope to duplicate the festive
feeling of previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   They did cheer the third-minute goal by Steve Jolley, who was
unmarked as he headed in a corner, but the stadium soon became
eerily silent.
</P>
<P>
   After the goal, the Galaxy retreated into a defensive posture, a
tactically-sound maneuver but hardly exhilarating for spectators.
</P>
<P>
   And the Revolution, though hobbled by injuries, displayed some
spirit but no scoring touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created enough chances to win the game,'' Revolution
midfielder John Harkes said. ``But we are giving up early goals,
and we've got to eliminate that straight away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not discouraging, because we didn't lose in the run of
play. We have to take responsibility for what happens because we
are letting in too many easy goals. But we understand what the
problem is. If we had lost by three or four goals, then we would
have a problem. We can build on this for the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkes, recovering from a sprained right knee, made his first
Revolution start since joining the team from D.C. United via
Nottingham Forest in England. He engaged in a spirited midfield
battle with the Galaxy's Mauricio Cienfuegos and directed the
Revolution offense.
</P>
<P>
   But Harkes tired in his first full game in three months, both
defender Richard Goulooze (calf cramps) and midfielder Jair (back
strain) departed in the first half, and defender Dan Calichman
(shin bruise) limped through the second half.

BUFORD PROVIDES A LITTLE THUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BUFORD-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mother Nature provided the rain that fell softly on
Fenway Park Sunday afternoon, leaving it up to Red Sox center
fielder Damon Buford to chip in with the lightning.
</P>
<P>
   The bolt off Buford's bat _ a 374-foot three-run job off Toronto
starter and loser Pat Hentgen _ came in the fifth inning, breaking
a 3-3 tie and giving the Red Sox a lead they never quite would
relinquish en route to a 10-8 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Buford, who went 1 for 4, also had a second-inning sacrifice fly
and his four runs batted in equaled a personal best for the former
Oriole, Met, and Ranger, who hit a career-high 10 homers last
season for Boston but waited until Sunday to connect for his first
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad,'' said Buford with a smile and a shake of the head.
``One home run in 100 at-bats (the total when he came to the plate
was actually 93). ``Seriously, you don't want to wait too long for
that first one, so it felt good. I knew it was gone. Now I don't
have to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buford was aware of the stiff wind that was blowing from right
field to left and he also was aware that Hentgen was one pitch away
from being in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to think of the situation and what he might
throw,'' said Buford. ``Playing in center field, I knew the rain
was coming in behind me, but the wind was blowing out. I mean, I'm
not a weatherman, but I could tell a storm was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen hadn't exactly owned Buford before Sunday. Buford, who
had four RBIs against the Blue Jays last July 23, had been 4 for 9
(.444) with a home run and a pair of walks in their previous
confrontations and while Hentgen struck him out with one out and a
man on in the fourth, Buford broke open the game an inning later.
</P>
<P>
   And don't let that 1 for 4 fool you.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of swinging for the Green Monster in the seventh,
Buford, with Mike Stanley on base with a leadoff double, did his
job by hitting a grounder to the right side, advancing Stanley to
third. While Boston didn't take advantage of the situation, Buford
had executed a fundamental play to go along with his sacrifice fly
and homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some quality at-bats,'' said manager Jimy Williams.
``Plus the big hit.''
</P>
<P>
   It all added up to what Buford termed, ``a real good day. Pedro
(Martinez) didn't look like he had his best stuff, but he went six
for us and gave us another quality start and that's all you can
ask. He's been picking up the team every time he pitches, so today
it was a good time for the offense to help pick him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Buford, who has been encouraged by Williams and hitting coach
Jim Rice to hit to all fields since his arrival last season, has
taken the cue. He had a 10-game hitting streak earlier this season
(14 for 41, .341) that ended May 9 and has been getting more
playing time against righthanded pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   There was never a question, however, about his defense. Buford
is tied for the team lead in outfield assists (3), with two of them
leading to double plays.
</P>
<P>
   And he nearly made the defensive play of the day Sunday when he
raced to the warning track in a vain effort to haul in former Red
Sox farmhand Pat Lennon's two-out double that just eluded his lunge
in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I got there,'' said Buford, who is batting .281.
``When I went to stab at it, I just missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to that Hentgen pitch in the fifth, Buford made
no mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hung the pitch and I just got good wood on it,'' said
Buford. ``I'm sure he'd like that one back.''
</P>
<P>
   But on a day when the Red Sox needed every run they could
muster, Buford and his teammates were happy to take the home run
and not look back as they headed for New York.

TEXAS HOUSE PASSES BILL TO INCREASE PAY OF TEACHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By JOHN W. GONZALEZ
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After one of the longest debates of the year,
the Texas House late Sunday approved a $3.8 billion school finance
plan for 2000-2001 that would increase every public school
teacher's pay by $3,000 a year while requiring all school districts
to reduce their property tax rates slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The 150-member body tentatively approved the bill without major
changes on a voice vote. Yet, member after member had attempted to
use the funding proposal as a vehicle to keep afloat dozens of
other education initiatives dealing with testing, benefits, class
size and taxation.
</P>
<P>
   One concept that could have prolonged the dialogue _ state-paid
vouchers for private school students _ was not pursued. Advocates
determined that floor support was insufficient to win approval of
even a pilot voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   The version of Senate Bill 4 that the full House approved was
close to the version that the House Committee on Public Education
had approved.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee had totally revamped the Senate-approved
bill that Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, had sponsored. The
Senate-approved bill had sought to boost teacher compensation by
focusing on retirement and other benefits, thus allowing districts
to contemplate reducing their tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   House members dumped the Senate plan out of fear that districts
would choose not to reduce tax rates, even if their income was
boosted by state contributions for retirement programs. The plan
the House was considering would send the $3,000 directly to
full-time teachers, counselors and nurses, while forcing districts
to reduce tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not control local tax rates, nor do we control the value
of property. But what we can do is control the amount of money
available to drive down tax rates,'' said House Education Committee
Chairman Paul Sadler, D-Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   He said the pay raise, while not everything that teachers
deserve, was the Legislature's long-overdue effort to recognize
their hard work. The last across-the-board pay raise for teachers
was in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, Senate Bill 4 recognizes the efforts of
our teaching professionals over the last decade in improving our
classroom performance _ including our student performance _ student
by student, classroom by classroom, campus by campus, throughout
this state,'' Sadler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adopts a $3,000 pay increase for every single teacher in
every single district,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which requires a final vote today before returning to
the Senate, also provides money to curtail social promotions and
improve Head Start, prekindergarten, kindergarten and 9th-grade
learning programs.
</P>
<P>
   The tax relief element would produce an average property tax
reduction of 6 cents per $100 in valuation. In the Houston
Independent School District, for example, the tax rate would drop
from $1.49 per $100 in valuation to $1.43. State financial analysts
estimate that the local tax relief generated by the bill would
approach $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Before debate on the funding proposal began, the House finished
work on a measure that rewrites Texas' open records law to make it
easier for the public to obtain government documents. Senate Bill
1851 by Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, was returned to the
Senate for further consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The open records bill would streamline the process that the
attorney general must follow to decide whether a governmental body
must grant an open records request.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than having 60 days to decide, the attorney general would
have 45 days. Limits on the types of financial information that
could be withheld were narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also provides for posting of notices to help the
public understand their right to information.

PACERS TIDY THINGS UP WITH SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The 76ers have a team meeting Monday at 1. Before
they attend, they should announce the ban of one literary item.
It's called a stat sheet. In some communities, such a ban would be
seen as censorship. Not here. What we are talking about is
self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's not to say the fourth and final game of their
best-of-seven series with the Pacers was not close. Indiana won,
89-86, at the First Union Center, to advance to the Eastern
Conference final against the Knicks or Hawks (New York leads, three
games to none).
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers erased a 17-point first-quarter deficit and had a
chance to win in the final minute. They won't know what an
opportunity they missed until they look at the stat sheet. That's
because late in the third quarter and for most of the fourth, the
Pacers couldn't make a shot. That's not an exaggeration. For 10
minutes, the Pacers did not make a field goal. They missed 13
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers coach Larry Bird was asked how many games you can win
with droughts like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not very many,'' he said of the dry spell that began with 2:12
remaining in the third and ended with 2:02 left in the game. Bird
added, ``We got absolutely nothing out of our second unit. The
second unit let a good lead evaporate and eventually Philly went up
by 4 (83-79). The starters played well all game long.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird's team is 7-0 in the playoffs for a reason. It knows how to
win. It had a 12-point lead when the drought began and trailed,
83-82, when it ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers certainly didn't punish Indiana for not being able to
score. When the game was over, someone asked Philly's Allen Iverson
(25 points) if Rik Smits fouled him with 41 seconds left. He said
yes. He also said, ``But it shouldn't have come down to all that.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. The Sixers got their 4-point lead when Matt Geiger
hit a short baseline jumper over Smits with 3:17 to play. But then
they got silly. Point guard Eric Snow threw the ball away on
consecutive possessions, the last of which led to a Chris Mullin
drought-snapping 3-pointer. After Iverson missed a jumper, Reggie
Miller made a difficult, 15-foot runner with 1:31 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to pull up for a three,'' said Miller, who finished
with 23 points, ``but I had missed two in a row and you have to
know clock and score.''
</P>
<P>
   That would have been good advice for Snow. Not known as a great
shooter, Snow pulled up for a 26-footer. Fifteen seconds remained
on the shot clock. Snow's shot wasn't even close. Smits followed
the miss with a layup and the Pacers would not trail again. The
game was over and the 20,844 fans here knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People knew it was over, but no one left,'' Iverson said of
the Philly fans. ``It means so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers, who lost 51 games a year ago, have excited this town
again. But now they and their rejuvenated fans will not be able to
play again until next season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's sweep made history. It is the first time any Sixers
team has been swept in a seven-game series . . . Jalen Rose was a
miserable 1 of 11 from the field. ``It was probably the worst game
he's played all year,'' Bird said . . . Sixers president Pat Croce
reminisced about '97 when, ``I went after Rick Pitino real hard
during March Madness.'' Croce also pursued Phil Jackson and Larry
Brown. He settled for Brown when he couldn't land Jackson and ``it
looked obvious that Rick was leaning toward Boston or staying in
Kentucky.'' He said he's glad he chose Brown. ``God works in
mysterious ways,'' he said. ``It was a blessing that we got
Larry.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fact: It's over. Formality: It can't end until Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, the Atlanta Hawks could pull themselves together and
somehow avert a sweep at the hands of the New York Knicks. And
someone from ``Save Fenway'' will be invited to throw out the first
pitch in the new ballpark four years hence.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-0 series lead is a submission hold in the NBA, and that's
what the Knicks have on the Hawks following Sunday's convincing
90-78 triumph at Madison Square Garden. Before this messy thing was
over the crowd was calling for both the sweep and geriatric center
Herb Williams. They also were saluting that well-known scoring
machine Chris Dudley, who fouled out with 1:06 remaining to a
standing ovation after playing the best playoff game of his career
(14 points, 12 rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   With Indiana already into an Eastern Conference final that will
begin Sunday, the Knicks would like to avoid a Game 5 by wrapping
up the series Monday night. ``We don't want to return to Atlanta
and allow Indiana to have all that rest while we're in a war,''
Dudley said.
</P>
<P>
   A what? The closest Atlanta got in the final 23 minutes was 9.
The Hawks shot 31 percent for the game and 21 percent for the
second half. If this was war, it was the USA vs. the Grand Duchy of
Fenwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``One problem we've had in the whole series is that we haven't
shot well,'' lamented Atlanta coach Lenny Wilkens. ``It's hard to
win when you're shooting in the 30s. The low 30s.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks followed their new game plan perfectly. In other
words, they constructed an early lead and then called on the firm
of Sprewell &AMP; Camby to put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell and Marcus entered the game in tandem with the Knicks
leading, 15-12. They proceeded to score 20 of the next 28 New York
points. Sprewell hit his jumper _ Steve Smith simply could not stay
with him _ and Camby rammed home second shots and easy post flips.
In the second half, Camby teamed with Dudley to control the inside,
allowing the hobbled Patrick Ewing (24 painful minutes) to spectate
in peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two guys who hurt us were Camby and Sprewell,'' confirmed
Wilkens. ``When they come in they are fresh. Without (the injured)
Laphonso Ellis and Alan Henderson, we can't replace Grant Long, and
we have no answer for Camby.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta hung around for a half like some sort of Loyal
Opposition whose sole function is to dignify the system (think
Massachusetts Republicans). But the Hawks only scored 24 points in
the first 26 minutes of the second half, by which time the Knicks
had a 76-60 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It's over, of course, but New York coach Jeff Van Gundy can't
say that. ``I'm just worried about getting one more win in this
series,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If that's really true, he's the only one.

DE LA HOYA SEEKS TRINIDAD 
</HEADLINE>
 LA HOYA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oscar De La Hoya wants more knockouts. Felix
Trinidad wants more money. They both may find what they're looking
for Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   A newly, and at times unwisely, more aggressive De La Hoya
emerged Saturday night in his 19th title fight, a defense of the
World Boxing Council welterweight championship that ended with De
La Hoya knocking out game Oba Carr with a long left hook that
exploded off the challenger's face and sent him spinning like a
felled tree to the floor moments into the 11th round.
</P>
<P>
   When Carr whirled sideways and then backward before falling
face-first to the canvas, it was evident he was destined to fight
no more this night, which he did not after getting up on legs so
wobbly that referee Richard Steele immediately stopped the bout at
the 55-second mark to give De La Hoya his 31st win without defeat
and the knockout he said had been his goal.
</P>
<P>
   While Carr was falling in Las Vegas, International Boxing
Federation welterweight champion Trinidad's father, Felix Sr., and
promoter Don King were fighting in Puerto Rico. The issue was
whether a purse offer of $10.5 million guaranteed plus a
well-hidden $500,000 and an upside of pay-per-view sales was enough
to match the IBF champion with De La Hoya this fall at the same
Mandalay Bay Events Center where Carr was sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Logic and business sense tell King, Trinidad's promoter, the
deal is a good one. As good, in fact, as it gets for Trinidad, who
until he made $3 million to fight Pernell Whitaker in his last
fight never had earned more than $1 million from King.
</P>
<P>
   But Trinidad's father, who long has been at odds with King,
claims the deal he rejected last week stood to pay his son $8
million and King $2 million and the additional $500,000 that came
in a later counteroffer was all going to the promoter under the
present terms. Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter and the lead man in
the negotiations, insisted that was inaccurate and the deal would
be worked out because ``King and I have a signed deal. The rest of
them are just fighting. It'll work out.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably so, in part because of Carr's courageous outing
against De La Hoya. While Trinidad knocked Carr out in eight rounds
after Carr dropped him early when they met several years ago, De La
Hoya nearly was taken the distance by Carr and ended up with a
split left cheek (the result of an intentional head butt, according
to Steele), sprained left hand, and swollen left eye before he
finished off Carr.
</P>
<P>
   So the Trinidad camp may have taken some solace in what it saw
Saturday night, believing its power puncher can get to De La Hoya
with lead right hands and left hooks more consistently than Carr
did, and with far more power. If they do believe it, they will grab
the money on the table and forget arguing for $8 per home for every
pay-per-view sale over 850,000, as Trinidad's father was demanding
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The original deal agreed to by Arum and King called for Trinidad
to receive $10 million guaranteed plus $6 per home for every sale
over the first million. Since De La Hoya never had topped 760,000
that seemed a bit much, but Arum argued if Trinidad wanted a
smaller guarantee he would get more of the upside. But Trinidad's
father always has favored guarantees over possible pay-per-view
sales and seldom looked for opponents who might pressure his son,
which is why some people believe he would rather see this deal go
away despite the huge pot of gold if he takes it and the larger one
later if his son wins.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, Trinidad's signature on the contract seems
as inevitable as Carr's back on the floor Saturday night because of
the numbers De La Hoya can write into an opponent's contract.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya gets what he wants because he can pay what you want
and what he wants now is a unification fight with Trinidad that
would cement him as the best welterweight of his era and allow him
to move on to the 154-pound division to create another
mega-millions fight with another former Olympic gold medalist,
World Boxing Association champion David Reid.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, De La Hoya must survive this new ``style'' he
revealed against Carr. In the opening minutes it was indeed a more
stalking, aggressive, pressure-creating attack that overwhelmed
Carr with hand speed and power. But after he dropped Carr for the
first time with a left hook after having wobbled him with a jab, De
La Hoya seemed to drift off into an unfocused approach that was
sometimes warrior and other times waltzer.
</P>
<P>
   That still allowed him to dominate Carr for most, but not all,
of the night. But it left co-trainer Gil Clancy wondering when his
young fighter would simply go fight, because when he does, Clancy
believes, guys like Oba Carr go away quickly and guys like Felix
Trinidad go, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He convinced himself what he would do and he did it in the
first round,'' Clancy said. ``Then he stopped. It becomes a chess
match with him instead of a fight when all he has to do is fight
because his hand speed is so much faster (than his opponents) and
he punches so hard he can get you out at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single round he opened up against (former WBA champion
Ike) Quartey he won the round. You need a psychiatrist to figure
out why (he doesn't always do that). When I had Emile Griffith I
was happy when he got hit with a good shot early in a round. Then
he'd go kill the guy. Who knows why?''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy believes if De La Hoya approaches Trinidad throughout
their fight the way he did the first and last round of the Carr
bout, the outcome will be clear and quick, because just like De La
Hoya beat Trinidad to the negotiating table to sign a contract he
also will beat him to the punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felix is a bomber, so the idea is to hit him before he hits
you,'' Clancy said. ``He's not a puzzle. Trinidad is very
dangerous, but he's a little slower than Oscar.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Trinidad has been slow to sign to fight De La Hoya. If
that difference in hand speed between them follows each into the
ring Sept. 18, Oba Carr won't be the only guy Oscar De La Hoya has
knocked to the floor at the Mandalay Bay Events Center, just the
first.

KOSOVAR REFUGEES SAMPLE CALIFORNIA LIVIN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They fled from explosions, executions and the
politics of war in the poorest region of Europe. They set foot in a
new world last week, thousands of miles away from the horrors they
left behind in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And by Sunday, the grim faces of 28 Albanian refugees
transplanted to Los Angeles took new form as their first weekend in
America came to a close. Their memories of ruin seemed to wash away
in the excitement of discovery and adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Their excitement came from beaches, the desert, buffet lines,
grocery stores, movie houses and tourist spots. They took crash
courses in using microwaves and washing machines. With the help of
homemade language charts, they did their best to communicate with
their host families.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've been beyond Serbia,'' 55-year-old
Nuhi Vlashi said through an interpreter. His family of eight has
taken up residence at a host home in Simi Valley in neighborning
Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the men have traveled, but nowhere as far as America.
It's nice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, the Vlashis, staying with Lloyd and Joan
Martin, woke to a breakfast of banana nut bread baked by the
Martins' neighbor. The Martins took four of the Vlashis' six
children to their Catholic church, but the children, Muslims, chose
not to go inside. They waited in the car.
</P>
<P>
   By 10:30 a.m., Almas Rexhepi, who had helped translate for the
Martins and their guests, brought doughnuts and told them about
their uniquely Southern Californian next destination.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, the two families were piling out of the Martins' Ford
Explorer at Malibu's Zuma Beach.
</P>
<P>
   For the Vlashis, the experience of sand between their toes and
the sight of eight-foot waves crashing before them was as foreign
as their host country. Rexhepi didn't come along to translate for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our own,'' Lloyd Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Nuhi Vlashi and his wife, Muradja, walked with care toward the
ocean. But their children had already made a beeline toward the
surf, their faces fixed in awed smiles. The mushy sand moistened by
the tide is easy to write in, daughter Emrije, 22, discovered. She
wrote the word ``Kosovo'' in it with her finger. The tide washed it
away. She wrote it again.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Martin stayed with the parents while the children threw a
football among themselves _ underhand and sidearm despite Lloyd's
example. Lloyd showed them how a Boogie Board works. The Vlashis
cheered when daughter Mirvete caught a small wave. Lloyd held the
13-year-old aloft in his arms, jumping just as a wave splashed past
them.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Martin has been trying to gauge what food the Vlashis like.
Definitely Cheerios. Absolutely not pork. Eggs, maybe some other
time. The Martins have hosted nine foreign exchange students over
the past 22 years, but never a family. After two days, she
concluded that some things are universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They act out. They fight. They talk. They're a normal
family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Martin was learning about Albanian culture as fast as
Emrije, the second-eldest daughter, and Sufete, the Vlashi's
12-year-old son, picked up English words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people here think they're pretty primitive,'' said
Lloyd Martin, gesturing toward the Vlashi children. ``They have
extreme respect for their parents, but we've advanced way past
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The two families communicated without their English-to-Albanian
language chart. It took work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want a towel to dry off, dear?'' Joan asked Mirvete as she
returned dripping from the ocean. Mirvete grabbed a jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Towel? No?'' said Joan, her voice trailing off.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Martin said he prefers excursions to natural places like
the beach though he and Joan might take Knott's Berry Farm up on an
offer of free tickets for their guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed feelings about Knott's Berry Farm and
Disneyland,'' he said. ``It's our American version of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Vlashi children had jumped into the white Ford
Explorer and set off on an adventure to Vasquez Rocks with Lloyd
Martin behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ate pancakes this morning before we left. I think they
liked them,'' Joan Martin said, describing how they experimented
with syrup. ``Maybe we'll try to find an Albanian restaurant for
them in the San Fernando Valley. That would be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the park, the six youths jumped out of the Explorer
and stood on the running boards and bumpers, riding outside the
vehicle as they drove toward Vasquez Rocks' famous peak _ most of
them in the same clothes they wore as they stepped off the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Martin stepped out of the car, pointed to the peak, and within
120 seconds the group scaled their way to the top, barely stopping
to take a breath.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar with the terrain, their clunky heels and Nike tennis
shoes with two-inch soles didn't hold them back.
</P>
<P>
   They posed for photos. They waved to passers-by. They laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Sufete Vlashi rested his head in his arms and began to cry. His
sister Nurije, 24, wrapped her arms around him and gave him
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' Emrije Vlashi, 22, said in broken English as
they descended.
</P>
<P>
   How about the food? American lifestyle?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very good. We like (it),'' Emrije said, referring to her
English-to-Albanian language chart.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the agenda was a trip to Barstow, where Lloyd Martin
would introduce them to his father. Then dinner _ at Denny's.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way they can see the pictures of the food,'' Joan Martin
joked.
</P>
<P>
   Rexhepi, one of the only Albanian immigrants living in Simi
Valley, had met the Vlashis after they arrived and greeted them
with hugs and comfort, being the only local who can speak the
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see them happy. They seem well,'' Rexhepi said.
``I ask myself: What have these people done to deserve this? This
war is all about greed, about men who are not satisfied with what
God gave them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at them now. They have some peace.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the refugees now in Los Angeles are extended relatives of
Hajrush Vlashi and his wife, Renee, of suburban West Hills. They
sponsored their family members as immigrants and, with the help of
the Valley Jewish Federation, were able to rescue them from the
war-torn Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Six families agreed to house Vlashi's relatives for several
weeks. Four other family members remain in Macedonia and were
expected to arrive later.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the refugees have said they are enjoying their
time in America, most hope to return to Kosovo when the conflict
ends. The Federation plans to move the refugees into their own
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Federation spokeswoman Bonnie Somers said Sunday that the
organization has established a fund for the refugees. The Kosovar
Refugee Resettlement Fund will pay for security deposits on
apartments and other necessities incurred as the refugees establish
their own residences in Los Angeles.

 CUP-BOS  
 McCORMACK RIDES ON  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ There's no way a bicycle race with more than
100 riders should give anyone a home advantage. But try telling
that to Mark McCormack of North Easton, who Sunday came from the
middle of the pack to bolt to a sprint finish win in the sixth and
final day of the Atlantic Cup Classic in Harvard Square. Last fall
he was another local hero when he won the national cyclocross
championship at Devens.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Monahan, a top category amateur racer from Wyckoff, N.J.,
defended his title as overall winner in the series. He won only one
of the races, but placed in the top four every day and took home
$500 as overall winner, plus another $1,500 for his finishes over
the past five days.
</P>
<P>
   The streets bordering Harvard Yard were closed to traffic for a
few hours Sunday, and orange plastic mesh fences were put up on the
sidewalks, but other than that it seemed like just another Sunday
in the square. Chess players matched wits in Holyoke Center, mimes
danced near the MBTA subway stop, and homeless people asked for
change.
</P>
<P>
   All the while master of ceremonies Dick Ring was giving nonstop
commentary from the podium as the 123 racers blew around the
.7-mile course 50 times in the 35-mile criterium. The riders, who
removed their helmets when the national anthem was played at the
beginning of the race, put them back on and locked their shoes in
their pedal clips when the race was counted down at 12:30.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next hour, the competitors, riding at 40 miles per
hour, became a blur of multicolored jerseys as they zipped down
Massachusetts Avenue, took a left on Quincy Street past the Fogg
Art Museum, another quick left on Broadway, then through the
underpass back to Mass. Ave. About 5,000 spectators lined the
route, according to race director Paul Salvucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``After six days of racing, it's not so much what the course is
like, but what everyone's legs are like,'' said Monahan, 27. The
criterium series began with a race in Northampton Tuesday, then
moved on to New Bedford, Providence, Salem, and Somerville before
Sunday's race. Monahan won the race in Somerville.
</P>
<P>
   So as wearer of the leader's yellow jersey, he knew he was a
hunted man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the defensive, because I had a 9-point lead, and all
I needed to do was just stay close,'' he said. Sylvain Beauchamp of
Canada finished second overall, and McCormack was third.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack sat in with the pack for most of the race until about
15 laps to go, when he started thinking about how he'd make his
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I didn't want to be leading going up that hill, because
there's so much of a headwind,'' he said, referring to the uphill
climb as the pack emerged from the underpass and headed toward Out
of Town News. So he waited until the pack rounded the corner and
the finish line was in sight. ``I was probably 20 guys back, but I
made a charge on the left, and Robbie Ventura came on the right
when we were on that bend and then it was just a drag race.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormack raised his hands in victory as he crossed the line in
1 hour 18 minutes 26 seconds. Just behind him was Saturn teammate
Ventura and 20-year-old amateur Charles Dionne.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack, 28, said the past week has been tiring not just
physically but emotionally. He learned that his older brother,
Frank, was involved in a crash while racing the Tour of Japan last
week. He is hospitalized with broken bones in his hand and a
damaged left kidney.
</P>
<P>
   So Sunday was especially sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've been racing my heart out all week, but I've
had a lot on my mind, and my results haven't really shown it,'' he
said. ``For me, this was a great way to cap out the week of
frustration.''

GOOD TURNS GET BUHL IN 
</HEADLINE>
 500-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Still smoldering over the mistake he made
Saturday when he crashed his primary car in Turn 1 _ on the warmup
lap of his initial qualifying attempt, no less _ Robbie Buhl said
he felt immensely relieved but hardly redeemed after finally making
the 33-car field Sundy for Sunday's 83d Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   After wrecking his primary car Saturday, then blowing the engine
of his one and only backup Sunday, Buhl jumped into a loaner
provided by A.J. Foyt and qualified with a four-lap average of
220.115 miles per hour. Mother Nature also did Buhl a good turn
when he bumped his way into the field for his fourth consecutive
Indy 500 start by bettering Mike Groff's four-lap average of
220.066 m.p.h., just before the rains came and brought an abrupt
halt to Bubble Day activities at Indianapolis Motor Speedway at
2:03 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 1/2 hours later, Speedway officials declared
qualifications complete and closed the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, when we took the car back (after the engine blew)
and started busting it apart, we figured with the weather, `This
isn't going to work,' '' said Buhl, a 35-year-old native of Grosse
Pointe, Mich., and a 1986 graduate of New England College in
Henniker, N.H., who came to Indy as the primary driver for Sinden
Racing Services. ``So, we kind of scattered around to see what
other people had. Somebody talked to A.J. So, I went to see him and
it was a pretty casual conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.J. was kind enough to say, `Hey, I've got two cars. See
which one works best for you,' '' Buhl added. ``Our two teams just
pulled together and made a couple of calls that were right. I think
we timed it just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after Buhl came across the start-finish line and took the
checkered flag, ominous rain clouds overhead finally burst and
stranded Marco Greco in the pits as he was preparing to take the
track for his qualifying attempt. It also dashed any hopes Groff,
Scott Harrington, Stephan Gregoire, Jaques Lazier, and Lyn St.
James, who was the slowest among the record 33 first-day qualifiers
Saturday and first bumped Sunday, from bumping their way back into
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime car owner Dick Simon was also left out in the cold when
his driver, Gregoire, failed to qualify, marking the first time
since 1982 that Simon will not be at the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   They were all shut out by one of the tightest fields in the
history of the race. To wit: the margin in qualifying times between
pole winner Arie Luyendyk and rookie Wim Eyckmans, the slowest
qualifier, was 3.695 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the range of emotions he felt, Buhl said, ``The
biggest emotion I feel is that I'm still angry and mad at myself
for what I did Sunday. I was probably too confident in the race
when I went in that first time by and hadn't taken the green. I was
trying to wind things up too quickly and that was a mistake I made
and I should've known better. So I'm still trying to get over the
screwup I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhl attempted Saturday to bring his tire temperatures up to
speed on the first of two warmup laps when he bobbled it in Turn 1,
did a half-spin, and hit the outside retaining wall, causing heavy
damage to the left side of his car. Buhl was not injured,
physically _ just psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can understand how bad you feel as a driver
when you do what I did,'' Buhl said. ``I mean, the day before
qualifying, the guys were back in the shop and up until five in the
morning putting a motor in the backup car, just in case. Then I go
out, you know, and make a mistake. You just don't understand how
that feels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it makes it more rewarding when you don't have five
cars sitting there and you're busting your butt with the one car
you have. And it does make it satisfying with A.J. offering up his
car and his crew guys and you go out and do five or six laps in it
and you go out and you're able to qualify. There's some
satisfaction in that.''

WHEELING AND DEALING AT GUN SHOWS COMING UNDER INCREASING
SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISA STIFFLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer

<P>
   LAKEWOOD, Wash. _ The single-shot pistols and rifles are neatly
aligned on the Asian rug covering the folding table. Some of the
metal on the old German guns have subtle, marble coloring and
multiple triggers that designate which barrel fires.
</P>
<P>
   These are features their owner, Larry, appreciates. His array of
firearms are meant for collecting more than for hunting or to use
in self- defense. In fact, ammunition is not even available for
many of the guns, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The adjacent table is lined with hand-made knives for fishing
and hunting. The perfect blades curve toward exotic hard-wood
handles. Two tables down, 19th-century hand-woven baskets from
Northwest Indian tribes are decorated in whale motifs.
</P>
<P>
   Across the aisle a collector has a hodgepodge of handguns and
pre-ban semiautomatic rifles and a few patches and buttons from the
Civil War for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the all-American gun show, touted by some as a
celebration of U.S. history and the weapons that made it; to others
it's a Tupperware party for criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But as sensational crimes are linked to gun shows as a weapons
conduit to criminals, the all-American pastime of wheeling and
dealing firearms in a flea-market-style forum is coming under
increased scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday a youth violence bill passed the U.S. Senate, and,
thanks to a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Al Gore, an
amendment was added to the bill that tightens restrictions on
transactions at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, now in the House, would require all buyers at
gun shows to undergo a background check before taking home their
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, background checks are done only for firearms
purchased from licensed gun dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms reports that
licensed dealers make up 50 percent to 75 percent of the sellers at
gun shows; the rest are non-licensed vendors, most of whom are
collectors buying, selling and trading guns as a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, President Clinton Saturday cited
attacks on students in Colorado and Georgia and urged the House to
pass the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call on the House to take immediate action,'' Clinton said.
``I hope the House of Representatives will pass every one of these
common-sense efforts that the Senate has passed to protect our
children from guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism by the government and public, collectors and
dealers met this weekend in the Tacoma, Wash., suburb of Lakewood
for the monthly Pacific Arms Society gun show _ one of the 4,000
guns shows held annually in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Parents with children, war veterans and young couples circulated
the tables that mostly filled the former Ernst hardware store
behind the Lakewood Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Gary has pieces of his collection on display at a table near the
front of the show. A glass case holds German handguns worth
hundreds and even thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Gary's love of German Lugers began when he sent away for a $2
toy gun advertised in a comic book. He now owns nearly 100 guns and
has a Luger from every year they were made, from 1900-1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all history,'' Gary said. If you know the background of
the weapons they can reveal a wealth of information. ``If you read
the right books, the darn things will talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hobby, like collecting stamps or baseball cards,'' he
said. Except gun collecting ``isn't politically correct.''
</P>
<P>
   The political incorrectness of guns worries those those who love
them.
</P>
<P>
   They worry about bad press, the increased pressure to reduce the
number of firearms people own, ever more legislation they say could
violate their constitutional right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of the government and criminals coming to take their guns
compels the collectors to withhold their last names.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors such as Larry and Gary, who made up the majority of
vendors at the Lakewood show, sell guns without filling out
paperwork and aren't required to inquire about a buyer's identity
or criminal background.
</P>
<P>
   Antique guns and firearms deemed ``curios'' because of
particular unique features are exempt from background checks when
sold by dealers and collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Gottlieb, director of Bellevue's Citizens Right to Keep and
Bear Arms, said the problem with background checks is they are slow
and gun shows are short, usually lasting only a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, shotgun and rifle sales are called into the
FBI's National Instant Background Check System, known as NICS, for
approval, which can take days. Background checks for handguns are
done by local law enforcement and can take up to five business
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had an instant check system that was really instant,
it'd be workable,'' said Gottlieb. ``No one would oppose (the
legislation).''
</P>
<P>
   Those lobbying for background checks for all buyers say the
legislation closes loopholes that allow illegal purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of regulation on gun sales by collectors makes these
transactions appealing to criminals, said Bruce Gryniewski,
director of Washington Ceasefire. Criminals ``are going to try to
find the easiest way to get a weapon without a background check.''
</P>
<P>
   But gun show participants say many of the sales are between
collectors who know each other. Criminals don't patronize the gun
shows _ they steal their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association cites Justice Department research
that found only 2 percent of guns used in crimes were obtained at
gun shows, about 25 percent from stores, and the rest were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Larry said he sometimes sees the same gun traded from dealer to
dealer, just circulating around the gun show regulars. He questions
the sense of doing a background check every time the trades are
made.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the new legislation wouldn't deter the criminals
from getting the guns and would not have prevented the recent
school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crook is still going to have the black market for guns,''
he said. ``None of this (new legislation) would have prevented any
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary said it would make more sense to enforce laws already on
the books covering firearms violations, but ``it's easier to make
new laws rather than enforce old ones.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the gun shows will continue as they have, bringing gun
lovers together for the weekend, to browse each other's collections
and swap history. And a fraction of America's 223 million firearms
will continue to pass through the hands of people without
background checks.

M'S OWNERSHIP TESTING PUBLIC INDEBTEDNESS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ To fully comprehend the breathtaking display of guts
required by the Mariner owners to inquire about more public money
for their new stadium, the Guilty Pleasure, it's helpful to review
a couple of statements.
</P>
<P>
   Both occurred in the second week of December, 1996, and help
explain how the park's cost has grown so much: A much larger room
at the new yard is needed to store the hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the King County Council, Ron Sims (now King
County Executive), Pete von Reichbauer, Cynthia Sullivan and Larry
Phillips, signed a letter asking that the ballpark construction be
slowed down because the schedule and a variety of legal challenges
put the county bonds for the project in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The letter stated in part: ``Frankly, we think the public would
be better served if the Public Facilities (District) were to adopt
a more realistic schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Provocative stuff, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent events have proven the caution was more than
warranted. At the time of the letter, the public was on the hook
for a proposed $295 million.
</P>
<P>
   It subsequently ballooned to $417 million. The price tag for the
park swelled to a pornographic $517 million _ and the owners are
now sniffing about attempting to recover as much of the $100
million difference as public foolishness will allow.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the cost inflation was the incredibly
compressed work schedule for the stadium _ at 26 months, the
fastest in modern American history for a sports park with a roof.
The owners insisted on a 1999 opening, even if it meant bidding out
the work based on a drawing on a cocktail napkin.
</P>
<P>
   But once the slowdown request reached ownership, its lawyers saw
a great opportunity to kibosh the entire deal, sell the club and
blow Dodge before they actually had to be responsible for a
half-billion dollar white elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Within a couple of days, Mariners CEO John Ellis, whimpering
before the TV cameras, announced that they were pulling out of the
stadium deal and putting the club up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because King County allegedly was going back on its commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regard the council members' letter,'' said Ellis, ``as a
clear decision by the political leadership of King County to
abandon their oft-repeated promises.''
</P>
<P>
   What?
</P>
<P>
   Where?
</P>
<P>
   How?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the letter, or any other council action, amounted to
more than throat-clearing about imminent financial disaster. The
council members, and most every policymaker and staffer in county
government as well as the owners, knew that costs would explode and
that the Mariners were looking for any pretense to cut and run.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Nintendo) rode in and blistered so many
political behinds so ruthlessly that all opposition to the Mariner
timetable melted away and transformed into one of the sweetest
leases in major league sports.
</P>
<P>
   The one financial commitment that the owners were forced to
accept was responsibility for all cost overruns. As each overrun
story surfaced, the Mariners renewed the pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Now the story is that Ellis and owner Howard Lincoln have
quietly engaged in what had long been anticipated _ a campaign to
grab the surplus generated by taxes used to build the park. That
money was pledged to retire the public debt earlier.
</P>
<P>
   So now who's ``abandoning their oft-repeated promises''? None
other than our own little high-tech baseball cabal, which accused
the county of same 2{ years ago. If the owners could teach this
much hypocrisy to pitch a baseball, the AL West race would be over
by Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   The PFD has long been aware the Mariners have their own lawyers
and construction consultants scrutinizing the stadium work, looking
for mistakes and excesses that will make a case in either a court
of public opinion or a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an unsolicited tip, owners, free of retainer fee: Stick
to a court of law. Because with public opinion, only Saddam Hussein
has a worse case than the Mariner owners.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, these guys helped save baseball here. Yeah, it was on
their watch when the game peaked in Seattle in 1995. Gratitude has
been plentiful and often expressed.
</P>
<P>
   But the October, 1995, decision to make the public the primary
partner in the stadium changed the equation.
</P>
<P>
   For all the Mariner whining about annual losses, the public now
has more invested in this franchise than the ownership. And the
public has no way to recoup its investment, whereas the owners will
come out more than whole when they sell the club _ as every
baseball franchise seller always has.
</P>
<P>
   The owners don't see it that way. Once they recognize their
coercion campaign is a non-starter, they will take the case to
court and sue us.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it's the (begin italics) Public (end italics)
Facilities District. But it has no money of its own. The Mariners'
partner, thee and me, are the folks with the money.
</P>
<P>
   And if we don't pay up, we will be told its our fault that Ken
Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez are wearing different uniforms.

FOOTING GIVES WAY AFTER M'S RALLY LATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ To the highlight shows, it was just another
blooper. Base runner trips between first and second, flops and
crawls to the bag, much too late.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing funny about it to Charles Gipson. The Mariner
outfielder left his blood and sweat on the Kauffman Stadium base
paths Sunday. He kept in the tears, but not his dejection.
</P>
<P>
   Gipson was on base as a pinch runner in the ninth inning of
Sunday's 5-4 Mariners loss to the Kansas City Royals. With one out
and Russ Davis batting, Gipson took off for second. He saw that
Chad Kreuter's throw would be high, and he was just about to start
his slide when his ankle turned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having a man in scoring position, the Mariners had
two outs. Moments later, Davis struck out to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tore ligaments in the ankle a few years back, and when it
gets to the point where it's going to roll, it just gives out,''
said Gipson, who had scrapes on his knee, wrist and knuckles and
wore an ice pack on his ankle after the game. ``I guess it just
gave out on me. You can't do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it cost us our momentum. I know I had that bag stolen.
It's just a mistake you can't make. It can't get any worse than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had won their past six games to reach .500 for the
first time in a month. Seattle heads to Minnesota today to face a
Twins team they swept last week.
</P>
<P>
   The M's will be glad to be through with Kansas City for a while.
They split six games with the Royals over the past two weekends,
but Kansas City rarely was out of any game and is one of baseball's
surprise teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played hard, they played well,'' said Mariners manager
Lou Piniella. ``We played hard, we played well.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. Handcuffed by Royals ace Kevin Appier for seven
innings, the M's scored three times in the eighth to take a 4-3
lead. But Mac Suzuki, who had not relieved in a close game all
year, walked the leadoff batter in the bottom of the inning,
forcing Piniella to call on Jose Paniagua for the third straight
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to stay away from using (Paniagua), but Suzuki just
didn't come close,'' Piniella said. ``He threw the first pitch over
and missed home plate by wide margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua got a ground ball that advanced Mike Sweeney to second,
then Jermaine Dye bounced one to third. The ball took what Piniella
called a ``side hop'' on Davis, and it went for a hit. Kreuter
popped up for the second out, but singles by Mariner-killer Carlos
Febles (13-for-22) and Rey Sanchez brought home the tying and
go-ahead runs.
</P>
<P>
   Davis may have lost Dye's ball in the white shirts behind home
plate at Kauffman Stadium, where the screen now extends all the way
to the ground and there is no wall in front of the fans. This was
the Mariners' first day game here in the new configuration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played it just right, and I kind of lost it,'' Davis said.
``You take your eyes off the ball on a day like today with a
backdrop like that, for one instant, you're done. By that time, the
infield was baked, and it was hard. But that's no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua (2-4), who pitched two innings Friday and 11/3
Saturday, had not worked three straight days all year. But he said
he didn't feel any less sharp Sunday than he'd been earlier in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to me and said, `If we need you in the game, will
you be ready?''' Paniagua said. ``I said, `Yeah, I'll be ready.' I
threw in the bullpen, and I said I felt OK.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a game that turned wild as soon as the bullpens came
on. Freddy Garcia allowed two first-inning runs, then permitted
five hits (three to Dye, who was 4-for-4) and one run over the next
five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw someone up in the bullpen in the second inning, and I
said, `Whoa,''' Garcia said. ``I just had to keep the game close.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Royals, the 31-year-old Appier was a departure from the
parade of inexperienced starters Seattle had faced in its win
streak. He held the M's hitless until David Segui's leadoff single
in the fifth. With Appier's contorted delivery and on a bright day,
the Mariners struggled to pick up the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it seemed like the ball was glowing, like a big
snowball up there,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Appier got help from Kreuter, who threw out Tom Lampkin trying
to steal in the third and Segui trying to steal in the fifth,
ending both innings on strike-'em-out/throw-'em-out double plays.
</P>
<P>
   But against reliever Scott Service, the Mariners tied it 3-3
when David Bell ripped a slider for a two-run homer in the eighth.
Alex Rodriguez followed with a double off the wall, and Ken Griffey
Jr. lashed a single to left off the left-handed Matt Whisenant,
giving the M's a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's 13th homer of the season broke Bret Boone's club record
for homers by a second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's single extended his hitting streak to 12 games, tying
a career high accomplished four times.

MAN'S RACING PASSION FOR THE BIRDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Flying nearly 60 mph over hundreds of miles, Rusty
Hemsath's racing pigeons dodge hawks, power lines and storms with a
single goal: getting home.
</P>
<P>
   Some soar in like a jet with wings locked.
</P>
<P>
   Some come in just happy to be back, circling on the approach and
flapping their wings with joy.
</P>
<P>
   They all made it back to the San Fernando Valley community of
North Hills one recent Sunday after a 245-mile flight from Merced,
and mere seconds separated the winners from the losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thrill just watching them come home,'' said Hemsath,
one of Southern California's top fliers after more than 60 years in
the sport.
</P>
<P>
   His birds fluttered into traps and walked across a computer
scanner that read their leg band and registered the time, number
and sex.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Hemsath's best bird did not win. But his birds are
the pride of the Sepulveda Racing Club, with two placing in the
national hall of fame.
</P>
<P>
   He once won a $5,000 purse in Snowbird, the prestigious race the
Fernando Valley Racing Pigeon Club hosts during the fall young bird
season; he raised a baby that won $36,000 for another flier and
produced offspring that won $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   The hobby of bringing the best out of these powerful and proud
descendants of European racing stock nevertheless remains the main
attraction for Hemsath and most of the Valley's fliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birds are the key to the whole thing. I just try to keep
them trained and healthy,'' Hemsath said.
</P>
<P>
   With four active clubs, pigeon racing is alive and competitive
in the San Fernando Valley. Clubs from Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks
and Ventura, as well as Orange and Riverside counties, often enter
the same races, sending 4,000 to 7,000 birds into the same flight
and pushing the best birds to the front.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this once-treasured pastime of men and sons faces an
uncertain future in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The first recorded U.S. race was a 500-mile flight ending in
Philadelphia in 1878.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak more than a century later, there were some 12,000
fliers across the nation. The number has dipped to 10,000 as the
fliers get older and fewer newcomers take up the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've grayed, we've matured and there's been no outreach.
We're a very well-kept secret,'' said Rick Phalen, executive
director of the American Racing Pigeon Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma City-based union is developing its first outreach
program to promote the sport, which is notable given the
organization was established in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few clubs have done that. We're looking at what kind of
tools we can put in the hands of people at local clubs, a spark of
creativity perhaps, what kind of financial support we can share,''
Phalen said.
</P>
<P>
   To attract future fliers, the Devonshire Racing Pigeon Club has
placed newspaper advertisements. It was the idea of Phil Ball, who
said the club must add to the dozen or so active fliers in its
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need membership, people to keep a club going and more
birds flying. The more birds you have, the more competition,'' Ball
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hemsath was just 15 when he bought his first bird. ``I went down
and bought a couple of pigeons for 25 cents apiece.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 77, he still loves the challenge of a race. ``When the bird
comes sailing in, I get the same thrill as I did then.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemsath's best bird was fourth among nearly 2,000 in the recent
race from Modesto. His best this season was first in a similar size
pack two weeks earlier in the Fresno race, a notable achievement
given a late spring storm that slowed the winning speed to 35 mph
and knocked down a few dozen birds.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks and power lines are other obstacles. But the vast majority
of racing pigeons learn to fly high enough and fast enough to enjoy
careers that can last some five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These birds are meant to fly all in a day,'' said Clay
MacBeth, a Granada Hills flier who also trains racing pigeons for
other area fliers. ``Anything under 400 miles is a straight fly
home. Anywhere from 400 to 600 miles, they will stop for a drink of
water and then come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually just a quick pit stop if they're going to be a
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The pigeon racing bug bit MacBeth when he was 14 and looking for
something that needed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the competitiveness started to take over,'' he recalled.
``I think I would have gotten bored with it and dropped it if it
hadn't been for the sporting activity.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Omni and Fernando Valley clubs, MacBeth is still
racing 35 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want friendly competition, it's there. If you want to
bet a little money on your bird, it's there,'' he said. ``You
strive to get your birds in condition to come home and then you
strive to get them into competition to win.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   With three birds in the state hall of fame, two of them also
earning national hall of fame honors, MacBeth's rank with the best
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   MacBeth has recorded a win so far on the spring season. His best
bird averaged 60 mph in taking the Delano race.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a racing pigeon get from there to here?
</P>
<P>
   Pigeons come home mostly on instinct, sensing direction, aided
by strong vision and hearing, fliers explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The homing pigeon is a very apt name for these birds. That's
why our pigeons aren't the ones people see bumming around the park,
hanging out on the library or even the next-door neighbor's
garage,'' explained Phalen. ``There's one place they're comfortable
and want to be, and that's home.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all racing pigeons are created equal, requiring experience
in breeding and skill in training.
</P>
<P>
   Fliers might spend $3,000 to $5,000 a year on feed, medication
and travel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Hemsath starts each winter with 24 pairs of breeders, typically
culling and adding several new pairs each year. Like most American
fliers, he buys from Europe because domestic racing pigeon stock
has gone out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   Born in January, babies will remain in a loft for a month before
they are allowed out to walk and begin flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more they fly, just like a kid exercising, the stronger
they get,'' Hemsath said. ``After a few days of this they will get
a little more adventurous. When they get a little confidence, they
will start roaming around.''
</P>
<P>
   Distance training lasts into the sixth month, as Hemsath carts
dozens of birds to release points farther and farther away from his
North Hills home. The final training flight begins in Bakersfield,
some 90 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   MacBeth, a Chevron tanker truck driver, trains racing pigeons
for other fliers twice a week. He hauls hundreds of birds in his
specialized truck to release points 50 to 100 miles beyond the San
Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``These pigeons are like any athlete, they need work,'' he said.
``They have to work out during the week to get ready for the event
on the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The races to Los Angeles range from 115 miles from Delano on
opening day to 600 miles from near the Oregon border in the final
week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In a race, the birds are all released at once, not long after
sunrise. Weather conditions at that time feature relatively cool
temperatures and, ideally, a tail wind.
</P>
<P>
   Homing instincts will get birds back, but fliers use lures to
bring them home sooner. Mates and babies awaiting their arrival are
powerful attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the homes.
</P>
<P>
   Hemsath's six lofts, for instance, are elaborate wooden
structures with boxes for each bird, heating and ventilation, even
plush grass for walks outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fliers create what they win and what they lose with.
You've got to find out all their qualities, and you have to bring
it out of them,'' Hemsath said.

LAKERS CAN'T BANK ON SHAQ IN PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ All you really need to know about the Los
Angeles Lakers is this: In a game they needed infinitely more than
their next paycheck, they never led.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers could have used a money player Sunday in Game 4 of
their Western Conference semifinal against San Antonio. Their
superstar center Shaquille O'Neal may be built as square as a
vault, but there's no banking on him in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the postseason, when teamwork and team defense are an
essential combination, he's an easy safe to crack. O'Neal
contributed 36 points and 14 rebounds Sunday, but that wasn't
golden for the Lakers. Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   He has done this five times now in his seven-year NBA career ...
that is, led a team into the playoffs so it can exit under the
force of a broom.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan scored the first basket Sunday, over O'Neal, and
those two points sent the Spurs off and sprinting to a 118-107 win
and a four-game sweep in front of a Forum sellout crowd that, like
O'Neal, didn't seem to get it.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the 17,505 spectators booed third-year player Kobe
Bryant as he dragged himself off the court, as though he was the
reason all the hope and dreams they invested in this season were
now so much worthless currency.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Bryant had a few missteps. He took some wild shots, was
slow rotating to his man on defense more than once and fouled out
with a minute left, with 16 points, eight rebounds and three
assists.
</P>
<P>
   All those numbers, though, are dwarfed by this one _ 20. That's
how old Bryant is. He's still so young. Think about it; how many
kids his age would you trust to drive your car, much less the lane
at the most critical point of the season?
</P>
<P>
   The thing you must believe about Bryant is he is not selfish,
just a little clueless. He has character and he cares. That's the
important stuff. The mistakes he makes can be traced to youthful
exuberance and inexperience, and both of those are correctable with
age.
</P>
<P>
   But what of O'Neal's shortcomings? At what point do you stop
looking at them as correctable and see them as character traits?
</P>
<P>
   He had only two assists in the four games against the Spurs,
which makes you wonder why his teammates bothered moving at all
when he had the ball. You couldn't have blamed them for wanting to
conserve their energy for the other end, knowing they'd have to
cover for O'Neal, who is downright phobic when it comes to
defending the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   His reluctance to move his feet at all once he staked out a spot
in the paint led to three illegal defense calls against the Lakers
in the first half. When he didn't have the ball in his hands,
O'Neal looked out of sync. Not surprisingly, the Lakers couldn't
find any rhythm; they trailed the Spurs 65-41 at the midway point.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room afterward it would have been music to our
ears to hear O'Neal blame himself for one of those open jumpers
David Robinson hit.
</P>
<P>
   Or promise to seek a hypnotist, an acupuncturist and/or Rick
Barry to help him with his free-throw shooting. (He converted 47.5
percent of his free throws for the series.)
</P>
<P>
   We gladly would have settled for any acknowledgment that maybe
he would have kicked more balls out to his teammates if the Spurs
hadn't been so quick to hack him. O'Neal might even have made a
joke at his expense _ gallows humor, you know _ and said something
like, ``Hey, they're no dummies. They were playing the
percentages.''
</P>
<P>
   As the team captain _ indeed, as a veteran player _ O'Neal
should have been the one to shoulder some of the blame, at least
publicly. (He could chew his teammates out in private as he saw
fit.)
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, though, isn't one to look hard in the mirror, unless
it's to admire his threads and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old man-child doesn't see much need to raise his
voice, even if it's to rally the troops before a do-or-die game.
Asked before the game if he planned to do something to pump up the
energy level in the room, he said, ``Talk to Rambis. He's the
expert. Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Kurt Rambis, the interim coach with the uncertain
future. O'Neal already has been heard making disparaging comments
about Rambis behind the coach's back, which isn't a very cool thing
to do when you're supposed to be setting an example for your
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   If O'Neal isn't behind him, it doesn't bode well for Rambis.
Just ask Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell, two players the Lakers
could have used in this series but were traded to Charlotte in
mid-March after O'Neal lost patience with them.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Del Harris. O'Neal denigrated Harris' coaching
style and we all know what happened to him. As much as we like
Rambis, he might as well update his resume and send it to the
printers.
</P>
<P>
   Unless ...
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has a clause in his $121 million contract that allows him
to opt out this summer. Let's hope he'll act on it. That would save
owner Jerry Buss and team executive Jerry West the hassle and
heartbreak of having to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   After firing Harris, signing Dennis Rodman and sacrificing Jones
and Campbell for Glen Rice and J.R. Reid, all on O'Neal's
recommendation, it's the only move Buss has left.

LAKERS CAN'T BANK ON SHAQ IN PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ All you really need to know about the Los
Angeles Lakers is this: In a game they needed infinitely more than
their next paycheck, they never led.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers could have used a money player Sunday in Game 4 of
their Western Conference semifinal against San Antonio. Their
superstar center Shaquille O'Neal may be built as square as a
vault, but there's no banking on him in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the postseason, when teamwork and team defense are an
essential combination, he's an easy safe to crack. O'Neal
contributed 36 points and 14 rebounds Sunday, but that wasn't
golden for the Lakers. Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   He has done this five times now in his seven-year NBA career ...
that is, led a team into the playoffs so it can exit under the
force of a broom.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan scored the first basket Sunday, over O'Neal, and
those two points sent the Spurs off and sprinting to a 118-107 win
and a four-game sweep in front of a Forum sellout crowd that, like
O'Neal, didn't seem to get it.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the 17,505 spectators booed third-year player Kobe
Bryant as he dragged himself off the court, as though he was the
reason all the hope and dreams they invested in this season were
now so much worthless currency.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Bryant had a few missteps. He took some wild shots, was
slow rotating to his man on defense more than once and fouled out
with a minute left, with 16 points, eight rebounds and three
assists.
</P>
<P>
   All those numbers, though, are dwarfed by this one _ 20. That's
how old Bryant is. He's still so young. Think about it; how many
kids his age would you trust to drive your car, much less the lane
at the most critical point of the season?
</P>
<P>
   The thing you must believe about Bryant is he is not selfish,
just a little clueless. He has character and he cares. That's the
important stuff. The mistakes he makes can be traced to youthful
exuberance and inexperience, and both of those are correctable with
age.
</P>
<P>
   But what of O'Neal's shortcomings? At what point do you stop
looking at them as correctable and see them as character traits?
</P>
<P>
   He had only two assists in the four games against the Spurs,
which makes you wonder why his teammates bothered moving at all
when he had the ball. You couldn't have blamed them for wanting to
conserve their energy for the other end, knowing they'd have to
cover for O'Neal, who is downright phobic when it comes to
defending the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   His reluctance to move his feet at all once he staked out a spot
in the paint led to three illegal defense calls against the Lakers
in the first half. When he didn't have the ball in his hands,
O'Neal looked out of sync. Not surprisingly, the Lakers couldn't
find any rhythm; they trailed the Spurs 65-41 at the midway point.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room afterward it would have been music to our
ears to hear O'Neal blame himself for one of those open jumpers
David Robinson hit.
</P>
<P>
   Or promise to seek a hypnotist, an acupuncturist and/or Rick
Barry to help him with his free-throw shooting. (He converted 47.5
percent of his free throws for the series.)
</P>
<P>
   We gladly would have settled for any acknowledgment that maybe
he would have kicked more balls out to his teammates if the Spurs
hadn't been so quick to hack him. O'Neal might even have made a
joke at his expense _ gallows humor, you know _ and said something
like, ``Hey, they're no dummies. They were playing the
percentages.''
</P>
<P>
   As the team captain _ indeed, as a veteran player _ O'Neal
should have been the one to shoulder some of the blame, at least
publicly. (He could chew his teammates out in private as he saw
fit.)
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, though, isn't one to look hard in the mirror, unless
it's to admire his threads and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old man-child doesn't see much need to raise his
voice, even if it's to rally the troops before a do-or-die game.
Asked before the game if he planned to do something to pump up the
energy level in the room, he said, ``Talk to Rambis. He's the
expert. Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Kurt Rambis, the interim coach with the uncertain
future. O'Neal already has been heard making disparaging comments
about Rambis behind the coach's back, which isn't a very cool thing
to do when you're supposed to be setting an example for your
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   If O'Neal isn't behind him, it doesn't bode well for Rambis.
Just ask Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell, two players the Lakers
could have used in this series but were traded to Charlotte in
mid-March after O'Neal lost patience with them.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Del Harris. O'Neal denigrated Harris' coaching
style and we all know what happened to him. As much as we like
Rambis, he might as well update his resume and send it to the
printers.
</P>
<P>
   Unless ...
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has a clause in his $121 million contract that allows him
to opt out this summer. Let's hope he'll act on it. That would save
owner Jerry Buss and team executive Jerry West the hassle and
heartbreak of having to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   After firing Harris, signing Dennis Rodman and sacrificing Jones
and Campbell for Glen Rice and J.R. Reid, all on O'Neal's
recommendation, it's the only move Buss has left.

POSTGAME CHORUS IS FOR MODICUM OF STABILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Out of the Forum, into the fire, the Los
Angeles Lakers face a summer that will make the past 100 days feel
like peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   They can be sure of only one thing _ Dennis Rodman is not coming
back.
</P>
<P>
   And who else?
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, J.R. Reid and Derek Fisher could depart as free
agents. Shaquille O'Neal's opt-out clause kicks in this summer.
That's four-fifths of the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Interim head coach Kurt Rambis is a long shot to stay in spite
of executive vice president Jerry West's assessment that he did ``a
very credible job under difficult circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   And West himself is no lock to continue, meaning the franchise
could lose the genius it'll need to sort all this out.
</P>
<P>
   There's even speculation Chick Hearn will hang up his hairpiece
rather than move downtown with the team.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lakers' locker room Sunday evening, players stripped off
the gold and purple and wondered aloud if it was the last time, as
unceremonious as their 118-107 defeat and four-game sweep at the
hands of the San Antonio Spurs might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we really know the future of this team,'' said
veteran guard Derek Harper _ who might retire _ said before
reciting the list of potential free agents that each Laker seems to
have committed to memory. ``A lot of things are up in the air right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   What will and what should happen?
</P>
<P>
   Player opinions ranged from Fisher's ``change is inevitable'' to
Rice's plea to keep the roster intact and let the players mature
together, tra la.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no way should you break it up,'' Rice said. ``Look at the
great teams. They've been together and they've gotten to know each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like what they were saying after last year's
playoff sweep, that's because it is what they were saying.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, then management traded point guard Nick Van Exel in
the summer, replaced head coach Del Harris with the rookie Rambis
two weeks into the new season, undertook what Robert Horry referred
to Sunday as ``the Rodman Era,'' and traded for a matching set of
new forwards.
</P>
<P>
   If that's what happened after last season _ which ended with the
roster so stable that not a single key player was able to leave as
a free agent _ then what are they in for now?
</P>
<P>
   Break 'em up? Keep 'em together? If only it were up to the front
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully in the next two or three months we'll find a way to
improve ourselves. The first thing everyone needs to do is relax,''
West said outside the locker room. ``We do have talent, but we need
to be more cohesive.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, relaxation's over.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the choices:
</P>
<P>
   West: Stressed out as always, he first refused to discuss his
future Sunday and then said, ``I've got awhile to be here yet.'' He
wouldn't leave the Lakers at a time like this.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis: He didn't show he's not up to the job. He didn't show he
is, either. When players were given opportunities to endorse him
Sunday, none did.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis' best hope is that Jerry Buss will get a load of the
sticker prices for proven coaches.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal: Could leave. But there's no reason to think he would.
He's probably dreaming up the next big Lakers trade as we speak.
</P>
<P>
   Rice: Lakers hold an option for one more season at $7.1 million.
Rice would like to double that. Keep him and make him unhappy? Sign
a richer new deal?
</P>
<P>
   Rice didn't fit in with O'Neal and Kobe Bryant and he still
wants to remake the offense in his image. Sign him and trade him
for _ stop me if you've heard this before _ a power forward or a
point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher: Said the chance to win not the chance to make more money
will be his priority in choosing a team for 2000. Meaning he'd like
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   But young Tyronn Lue's 29 minutes Sunday looked like an audition
for the point-guard job. Where does the chance to start fit on
Fisher's priority list?
</P>
<P>
   Harper: Frustrated that his ``leadership'' role diminished under
Rambis but with a year to go on his Lakers contract, the
37-year-old point guard's only alternative is retirement. Great guy
to have around although Rambis kept him on the bench Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Reid: Nice try guarding Charles Barkley and Tim Duncan, but he's
not the power forward the Lakers need, so they'll probably let him
walk.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox: Under the new NBA agreement, he can get a bigger raise
from the Lakers than a backup small forward with a problem foot
would get by going free-agent. Fox could wind up a starter again if
Rice is traded.
</P>
<P>
   Horry: With three years left on his contract, he said he's ``not
shipped to anywhere cold.'' That will depend on one thing, what
somewhere cold could give the Lakers in return.
</P>
<P>
   Horry's all for keeping the Lakers together and letting them get
to know each other, just as he was a year ago today, when the Jazz
swept them out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you see!'' Horry said. ``We had a lot of damn changes, so
we couldn't get to know each other.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, if you're one of the six Lakers left from '98,
stability might look like the most welcome change of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we get that opportunity (to stay together),'' Fisher
said. ``But the reality is we probably won't.''

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HERE is the latest bulletin on Houston's chances of landing the
32nd and possibly last NFL expansion franchise to be awarded in the
near future: The time has come to call off the dogs, spit on the
fire and go home.
</P>
<P>
   It's over. In Los Angeles, a nonexistent football team was able
to do this week what the Lakers could not _ stave off elimination,
roar from behind and clinch a win. It appears that in Houston we
were too busy tooting our own horns to hear the final gun. Members
of the NFL expansion committee slipped into town this week and
studied the latest stadium plans offered by the city's two
competing groups.
</P>
<P>
   Both plans involve the renovation of the elderly LA Coliseum,
but one model offers a 68,000-seat stadium, which could be expanded
to 92,000 seats for a Super Bowl, up to 27,000 underground parking
spaces and a recreation oasis to be known as Exposition Park.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a frosted glass rim around the stadium, two glass
towers in the end zone, reflecting pools, Roman fountains, picnic
areas and luxury boxes with grass patios.
</P>
<P>
   Readers of the Los Angeles Times woke up Sunday morning to find
that the awarding of the city's new pro football franchise had
become a virtual formality. One unidentified NFL official said the
Hollywood razzle dazzle ``just blew everyone away. We're talking
Central Park here and a unique recreation environment with the
stadium standing as a monument in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they are talking about a universe somewhere between
Central Park and Jurassic Park. And in this scenario, the monster
turns out to be Michael Ovitz, the one-time powerhouse agent and
short-term Disney executive. Paul Tagliabue, the NFL commissioner,
and Bob Kravitz (New England), Jerry Richardson (Carolina) and
Carmen Policy (Cleveland), who are viewed as the league's
decision-makers, were among those impressed by the Ovitz group.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would retain the peristyle that was patterned after
the Colosseum in Rome and became the symbol of two Olympiads.
Policy, who helped build a dynasty in San Francisco and is in
charge of reinventing the Browns in Cleveland, described the blend
of ancient architecture with the modern LA scene as ``exciting. It
creatively uses the concept around which the LA Coliseum was built
_ a grand place for sports spectacles.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual and generous move, Ovitz has donated his design
and blueprints to the NFL at no cost and without strings, meaning
the league would be free to award the ownership of the new club to
the group headed by billionaires Eli Broad and Ed Roski.
</P>
<P>
   It also could mean Ovitz, who has insisted he and his partners
would not consider a merger, might be edging toward a compromise.
Ovitz recently hosted a dinner at his home for the mayor, members
of the city council and county supervisors, also attended by such
celebrities as Dustin Hoffman, Warren Beatty and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   What this has to do with pro football might seem as vague as the
relationship between Rodeo Drive and the La Brea Tar Pits, but it
has much to do with raising the comfort level of the NFL owners.
</P>
<P>
   Around the league, Houston's Bob McNair made a handsome
impression with his diligence, his sincerity, his net worth and his
unceasing effort. But LA has the population, the TV sets, the glitz
and now what appears to be an acceptable stadium proposal. It would
include a contribution from the state to finance the more than $200
million needed to build those convenient parking garages, three and
four stories beneath Exposition Park.
</P>
<P>
   Where all this will end isn't clear, but your mind boggles at
the thought of parking garages costing more than most stadiums, and
tax dollars being an essential part of any NFL stadium package.
</P>
<P>
   Either of the two LA groups is believed to be prepared to spend
around $300 million for the new Coliseum and certain improvements.
It is clear the league wants them to obtain public assistance,
reluctant to set a pay-your-own-way precedent for owners with
future needs.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't necessarily mean the NFL used McNair or toyed with
Houston's neediness, although you are free to conclude this if you
wish. Nor does it mean the owners are not men of good will.
</P>
<P>
   We have known most of them, and many are self-made, active in
charitable works, and excellent hosts. We would only point out that
in today's sports market, it is sometimes pointless to go good will
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The quickness with which McNair jumped on the defeat of a
stadium bond issue for the Arizona Cardinals might be a clue he
knew the race with Los Angeles had ended. Arizona is a story for
another day, and we can only wonder why LA has chosen to punish
Houston and fold against San Antonio. Is it something we said?

LAKERS SWEPT BY SPURS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A Los Angeles Lakers season in which
anything and everything was subject to change ended abruptly Sunday
_ proving that in the end, nothing changed at all.
</P>
<P>
   No coaching change, no mix-and-match, throw-it-in-the-Cuisinart
blending of new faces and names, no number of experiments could
avert a repeat of past disappointments. The Lakers' season stopped
dead in another playoff sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Only the round and the opponent were different. The San Antonio
Spurs took the place of the Utah Jazz and, with a 118-107 rout,
sent the Lakers out of the Western Conference semifinals, four
games to none.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ironic and bitter conclusion to a thoroughly
disorienting season in which every desperate Lakers transaction to
win, now, at all costs, netted just another empty feeling.
</P>
<P>
   As the game wound down, television cameras panned across the
six, aging championship banners hanging above the Great Western
Forum floor, but the final game in the venerable old building's
history would not add anything to the legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very embarrassing,'' Shaquille O'Neal said of the Lakers'
second straight sweep out of the playoffs. ``Every time I get sent
home, I get embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was the Western Conference finals. The Lakers were
supposed to step forward, to a championship. Instead, a step back _
despite the addition of sharpshooter Glen Rice and the maturation
of young stars O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to deal with,'' said Derek Fisher, ``because each
year you set goals and you want to get better. And we really didn't
get better this season. That's what makes it so hard to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, even though we got swept in the conference finals,
we felt like we had taken that next step in becoming a championship
team. So coming into this season, we planned on winning. And the
lockout pushed all of that back, and the changes made it even more
difficult. So, right now, it's disheartening, but it's real and
it's life. So we have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Lakers may simply have conceded to the will and
the power of a more soundly constructed team. After losing Games 2
and 3 with a lack of composure in the waning minutes, the Lakers
were denied the chance to blow another late-game lead. The Spurs
made certain of that, leading from wire to wire.
</P>
<P>
   Only once in the second half did the Lakers threaten to extend
their season and make a return trip to San Antonio. After trailing
by as many as 17, they put together an impressive charge to end the
third quarter, using a 12-0 run to pull within 86-84.
</P>
<P>
   The run was a little bit O'Neal muscle, a pinch of Bryant's
will, some Rick Fox determination and part Tyronn Lue youthful
exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   But the season ended there. The Spurs, too veteran and too
fundamentally sound to be rattled, answered with a 13-0 run to open
the fourth quarter, and, minutes later, the first several hundred
fans began heading early for the Forum exits for the last time.
(Though not before offering a a few boos and a few sarcastic
``Ed-die'' chants in honor of traded guard Eddie Jones.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be embarrassed,'' Rice said. ``There's no way in the
world we should have gotten swept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we did everything we could to prevent getting
swept. We didn't play our best basketball, probably not one of the
games. The execution just wasn't there, and we paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a year ago, when the Jazz ran the Lakers off, there would
be no questioning of players' hearts and souls. Last May, O'Neal
bellowed that anyone without those qualities should ``get off my
team.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Lakers credited each other for playing hard, if
not always unselfishly or intelligently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried, guys tried,'' O'Neal said. ``Every time we made a
run, they just came down and hit a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys played hard. So I'm proud of the guys for playing hard
and not giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Lakers simply were no match for Tim Duncan (33
points) and a surrounding cast of role players _ including Jaren
Jackson (20 points) _ who fed off of him. The Spurs were always a
step ahead of a Lakers defensive rotation, resulting in 39 Lakers
fouls and 54 free-throw attempts by San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had very sporadic moments of putting (scoring) strings
together,'' said rookie coach Kurt Rambis, his ``interim'' label
hanging over him, his future unclear. ``I thought Ty (Lue) gave us
a nice little lift. We put a few things together now and again, but
we couldn't sustain anything for any length of time offensively.
Defensively, that's where we kept breaking down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give yourself absolutely no chance to win when you let the
other team shoot 60 percent, 58 (percent) from the 3s, go to the
line 54 times, turn the basketball over 15 times for 27 points; you
have no chance. Unless you're shooting 100 percent, you've got no
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers team that survived a lockout-shortened, 50-game
irregular season, the firing of coach Del Harris, a brief stopover
by Dennis Rodman and the trade of Eddie Jones for Rice now
contemplates another offseason of alterations.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, however, will compare to the insanity the Lakers just
packed into the last 108 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season, in particular, wasn't conducive to making
changes,'' Rambis said, ``and we made a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only team that made all these major changes in the
middle of the year ... and with no practice time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not an environment to get everybody on the same page.
That's something we were fighting all season long.''

FOND FORUM MEMORIES COME FLOODING BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A few minutes after the final buzzer sounded
_ probably the last final buzzer for an official NBA game in Forum
history _ Los Angeles Lakers public-address announcer Lawrence
Tanter thanked the fans for three decades of great memories.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like the big ashtray,'' longtime Lakers fan
Jack Nicholson said of the Forum. ``It's a great basketball arena.
I'll miss making the drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson has visited the Staples Center, set to open next
season, but it was in the daytime and he couldn't gauge the
atmosphere or traffic patterns. Good or bad, it won't be the Forum.
For Nicholson, nothing will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in Inglewood when I first came to California,'' he
continued. ``I walked to Hollywood my first time, along the route I
drive now. I walked all the way up La Brea. There were huge bushes.
It was scary when it was dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson has seen the great players and the championship teams,
but his most vivid Forum memory was an obscure incident a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always remember when Magic (Johnson) tried to teach Elden
Campbell how to run,'' he said. ``We got a big laugh out of that.
Running instructions, right there in the middle of the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Chick Hearn, the voice of the Lakers since they moved from
Minneapolis, gave an easy smile and quick answer when asked for his
fondest memory of the Forum, which opened Dec. 30, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when Jerry West hit that 63-footer to put the game
in overtime against New York,'' Hearn said of Game 3 of the 1970
NBA Finals. ``They were ready to play the overtime and no one could
find Wilt (Chamberlain). They didn't know where he was, so I said,
`Go look in the locker room,'' because Wilt liked to eat chicken
after games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went in and there was Wilt, eating chicken. They told him
to dry off his hands and go out there for the jump ball. I don't
know why he left the court. He must have thought there was a
3-point line or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the Lakers locker room after their 118-107 loss
to San Antonio on Sunday, West managed a faint smile while
recalling his favorite Forum moment: the team's 1972 NBA title _
his only championship as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly would not be today,'' he said. ``Maybe we should
schedule the Harlem Globetrotters or the Washington Generals to get
a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people have seen more Forum games than Tanter, the P.A.
announcer for 16 of the past 17 years. He recalled the vicious
rivalry with Boston and James Worthy diving out of bounds to tip
the ball to Magic against Detroit in the 1988 Finals. But like
Nicholson and Hearn, Tanter's most vivid memory has nothing to do
with victory or defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the 1983 NBA All-Star Game, and Marvin Gaye came down
the steps one minute before he was supposed to sing the national
anthem,'' Tanter recalled. ``He handed us a cassette of the audio,
and we put it on. At first, we thought it was the wrong thing. But
he had created his own background music. Then he sang, and it was
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   So are the memories.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The Lakers are scheduled to play at least one exhibition
game at the Forum in the fall.

VETERANS RICE, HARPER CONTEMPLATING FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Derek Harper arrived in January, bringing to
the Los Angeles Lakers his 15 years of NBA wisdom. Glen Rice came
in mid-March, bringing his deft shooting touch as the supposed
final piece of a championship team.
</P>
<P>
   But as both veterans watched their title hopes die in a
conference semifinals sweep Sunday, they shared doubts about the
team's future and their own.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Harper might retire rather than finish out his
two-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers could exercise a one-year, $7.1 million option on
Rice or give him a new deal, but he says it has to be on his terms.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, frequently frustrated playing third fiddle to Shaquille
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, said he ``won't be mad'' if he's back, but
said the team needs to change to fit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I pretty much tried it their way. It didn't work. So
now I think we gotta focus more on doing it a different way,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That means a more movement-oriented offense catered to Rice's
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be,'' he said. ``They got me here for a reason, and
that reason was not to go around and stand on the court and not do
anything. Put me to use, I like hard work. I tried to explain over
and over that when you run me off screens and post me up, things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper's role was defined in training camp, when he was named
co-captain shortly after being introduced. But he found it
difficult to get through to the young superstars around him; he
also discovered that his leadership was undermined when Kurt Rambis
replaced Del Harris as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Said Harper, ``I would have liked to have contributed more to
help this team be successful, but it didn't work out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The best example of the lessons he preached was found on the
opponent's bench Sunday. The San Antonio Spurs played as a team,
not a collection of individuals, and trusted everyone right down to
the 12th man, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Harper said, ``is how you have to play the game _ with
one agenda to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The brash young Lakers don't understand that yet?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think we do,'' Harper said. ``I have banged my
head against the wall. But it's OK. My head is perfectly fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he can earn $1.1 million if he returns, Harper _ whose
playing time diminished to the point he didn't even play Sunday _
is contemplating retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early for me to make a decision on that, to be
honest,'' he said. ``I've been (in the NBA) for 16 years. Believe
it or not, I've never gone through a year like this. It's been the
most interesting year that I've ever encountered.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran words: The Spurs' Mario Elie said the Lakers needed to
go to Shaquille O'Neal more often and need to let Kobe Bryant
develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great talent,'' he said of Bryant. ``There's no way
(fans) should boo him when he's coming off the court. That's weak.
When I retire, I'm going to pay for tickets to see him play.''
</P>
<P>
   History: Lakers forward Travis Knight set an NBA playoff record
by fouling out in just six minutes of play.... Lakers rookie Tyronn
Lue scored the final NBA points in Forum history, on a driving
layup with 25 seconds left.... In franchise history, the Lakers
have been down 0-3 on five occasions and have been swept each time;
in fact, no NBA team has come back from an 0-3 deficit to win a
playoff series.

DE LA HOYA ON THE MEND, EXPECTS TO FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oscar De La Hoya's injured left hand probably won't
stand in the way of his long-awaited mega-matchup against Felix
Trinidad on Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays on the hand _ injured in the second round of Saturday's
11-round knockout victory over Oba Carr, De La Hoya said _ were
negative, according to his doctor, Tony Daly.
</P>
<P>
   The hand was sprained just above the wrist, Daly said. He said
it was swollen after the fight, during which De La Hoya apparently
fought nine-plus rounds in pain.
</P>
<P>
   However, the WBC welterweight champion should have enough time
to heal. The fight is in four months. The earliest he would begin
serious training is mid-July, which leaves almost two months for
the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' Daly said when he was asked whether he thought
De La Hoya would be able to fight in September. ``It's four months
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The hand was put in a splint and he won't be able to use it for
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming De La Hoya's hand was really injured and a factor in
the fight _ we can only take his word for it _ his performance was
both gutsy and outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   First, De La Hoya is almost exclusively a left-handed fighter.
That means he won the bout even though his principal weapon was
damaged. Second, Carr is talented, well-schooled and very tough.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya landed 46 percent of his punches, while Carr
connected on only 21 percent of his, according to ComuBox
statistics. And the champion had two knockdowns, the second of
which ended the fight. That's a not a bad night.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, De La Hoya was extremely pleased afterward, even though he
desperately wanted to give a spectacular performance after a series
of tentative efforts the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad, the IBF welterweight champion, knocked out Carr in
eight rounds in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The scoring: De La Hoya (31-0, with 25 knockouts) would've won
the fight had it gone the distance. He led by five points and seven
points on two cards and three points on the third.
</P>
<P>
   However, it wasn't that one-sided. Carr lost two points in the
seventh round because of repeated low blows and head butts.
</P>
<P>
   Take that away and Carr was in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   A cut below: A cut on De La Hoya's left cheekbone, the apparent
result of a head butt, required stitches; it was inconsequential in
the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Fight hype: Promoter Bob Arum, of course prone to hyperbole,
said the De La Hoya-Trinidad fight will be the biggest
non-heavyweight matchup since Sugar Ray Leonard outpointed Marvin
Hagler in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he might be right.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Oscar De La Hoya is the biggest draw in boxing
outside of Mike Tyson. And Trinidad, while not a household name, is
widely recognized as one of the top-five fighters in the world.
</P>
<P>
   However, the bout could never rival the energy of the
Leonard-Hagler-Tommy Hearns-Roberto Duran era of the 1980s. Each of
those great fighters had built tremendous reputations _ largely on
free television _ during an era void of popular heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   The public bought into their rivalry because all four were
extremely compelling, while only De La Hoya has such appeal today.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, no lower-division matchup is more exciting
today. Very rarely do the very best agree to fight the very best,
and this is one of those times.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas Hilton has made De La Hoya a 7-5 favorite in the
fight, which is a virtual tossup.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the bout is not a done deal. Trinidad has yet to
sign off on it. However, those close to negotiations say only
last-minute details must be worked out and an official announcement
will be made soon.
</P>
<P>
   If Trinidad !ital!doesn't take the fight, he's crazy. He might
never again be in a position to make the more than $10.5 million
he's been offered.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy watch: De La Hoya, who said last week that he would no
longer work with Gil Clancy, now says the veteran trainer will be
back in camp for the Trinidad fight.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy works with head trainer Robert Alcazar in the final
stages of De La Hoya's training.
</P>
<P>
   Mayweather follies: Floyd Mayweather, who stopped Justin Juuko
on the undercard Saturday, was typically outspoken afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' he said at the post-fight news conference,
``Oscar was the main event, but I thought !ital!I was the main
attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the way he's been fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The WBC super featherweight champion was hardly spectacular
against Juuko, a last-minute replacement for Goyo Vargas, before he
finally knocked him out in the ninth round. Juuko was greatly
overmatched, yet Mayweather _ more interested in showboating than
punching _ had difficulty putting him away.
</P>
<P>
   It was his second straight mediocre performance. He was only
able to outpoint little-known Carlos Rios in February.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's return: Mike Tyson, due to be released from prison no
later than June 4, is expected to fight before the end of the year,
said Shelly Finkle, his manager.
</P>
<P>
   No opponent has been named, although Europeans Axel Schulz and
Brian Nielson are the names that pop up most. Finkel said he is not
near a deal with any possible opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis-Holyfield: The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that the
Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield rematch on either Nov. 6 or Nov. 13
will be at the new Mandalay Bay Events Center, the site of
Saturday's bout, citing unnamed sources close to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The first fight, in March, was at Madison Square Garden in New
York. It ended in a controversial draw.

FLOP OF A FORUM FAREWELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last one out of the Forum, turn out the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that's right. Tim Duncan already did....
</P>
<P>
   _Maybe you pick the San Antonio Spurs to rough up the Los
Angeles Lakers in six, but you don't expect the Lakers to look sick
in four....
</P>
<P>
   _The fans weren't booing, they were chanting ``Luuuuue.'' That
is, when they weren't chanting ``Eddie.... Eddie.''....
</P>
<P>
   _At least Tyronn Lue played with some heart and passion....
</P>
<P>
   _At the time it was a brilliant stroke of luck _ Kurt Rambis
turning down the Clippers on a head-coaching offer and then having
the Lakers hand one to him a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   As much as everyone was pulling for him to succeed, Rambo was
never able to pull the trigger. That was finally obvious when he
complained before Game 3 about the media not letting his team grow.
</P>
<P>
   Nap time, Kurt. It won't be the media who won't allow him room
to grow as a head coach. Team owners have a way of interceding....
</P>
<P>
   _Phil Jackson, please pick up the white courtesy phone....
</P>
<P>
   _Our stat sheet shows the Lakers still have a foul to give,
which might carry over to the Staples Center opener....
</P>
<P>
   _A superb public-relations move, Magic Johnson admitting his
interest in someday assuming ownership of the Lakers. Just at a
time when another outside distraction was the last thing the team
needed and Magic needed to draw some attention....
</P>
<P>
   _Here's hoping the Chicago Bulls make the playoffs every year
from now on so the public isn't subjected to the bloated Jerry
Krause rubbing his greedy hands together at NBA draft lottery time.
All Krause was missing was the sequined jumpsuit....
</P>
<P>
   _We're banking on the fact Pascual Perez drives a cab now in
Atlanta and will give Michael Ovitz a lift to the NFL owners
meetings....
</P>
<P>
   _Did you see Ovitz's plan for frosted-glass windows around the
roof of the renovated Coliseum? That'll stay fresh for about 20
minutes....
</P>
<P>
   _Eli Broad is gonna tell the owners that his 60,000-seat version
of the Coliseum will sell out each game, so they don't have to
worry about blackouts. How will he do that? He'll make up the
difference if ticket sales stink....
</P>
<P>
   _The formation of Major League Lacrosse, a new pro outdoor
league not to be confused with the indoor National Lacrosse League,
will be announced today.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has already expressed acute indifference but expects
the league to come begging soon, at which time it will show
absolutely no interest at all....
</P>
<P>
   _Your inflated insurance rates at work: Allstate has bought the
naming rights to Chicago's Rosemont Horizon. Terms were not
disclosed, but there's likely a $5 million deductible....
</P>
<P>
   _Chin-Feng Chen, the Taiwanese outfielder the Dodgers have on
display at their Single-A San Bernardino team, is hitting .340 with
seven homers and 37 RBI in 38 games....
</P>
<P>
   _Was the opening of Fox's ``Phantom Menace'' a menace to Fox's
Dodgers fandom last Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: With Kevin Brown throwing against the team with
the best record in the National League, the Dodgers forced 26,360
to come on in against the Houston Astros _ a 32 percent drop from
their season average prior to that day of 38,669. And there was a
Lakers playoff game, albeit on television, the same night going
head-to-head.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, 12 of the 14 teams that hosted a game
Wednesday saw an attendance slump. In New York, the Mets' game was
rained out....
</P>
<P>
   _Meanwhile, in a galaxy far, far away from first place in Major
League Soccer....

GALAXY WINS, STARS SIT IN SECOND HALF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Los Angeles Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid had seen
enough midway through the second half.
</P>
<P>
   While his strikers continued to miss opportunities as if they
were firing at a hockey goal, he pulled striker Clint Mathis in the
60th minute in favor of defender Ezra Hendrickson.
</P>
<P>
   Then he pulled Welton, the Galaxy's leading scorer last season,
in favor of rookie Marvin Quijano (69th minute), who made his MLS
debut.
</P>
<P>
   It was more of a statement than anything else, since Los
Angeles' 1-0 victory over New England on Sunday in front of 7,581
at the Rose Bowl was decided in the opening minutes off a header
from Galaxy defender Steve Jolley.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement was clear. Through 10 games now, forwards Cobi
Jones, Welton and Mathis have accounted for three goals
collectively, meaning it was time for some of these guys to sit.
</P>
<P>
   Post-up striker Carlos Hermosillo finished his season Saturday
in Mexico and should join the team following a week off, but for
the time being that's no consolation to Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I'm frustrated, but they're growing frustrated,
too,'' Schmid said of his forward trio. ``I didn't think Welton was
dangerous, and Marvin has been training well. As far as the other
two subs I made today, Clint and Joey (Franchino), I just didn't
think they had good games.''
</P>
<P>
   Schimd pointed to the help on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Necaxa's (Hermosillo's team in Mexico) finished, so
maybe the cavalry's on the way. And maybe things will get resolved
for Seth George (Galaxy's unsigned draft pick) next week as well.
They will both provide reinforcements. We could also be making a
trade that involves forwards. We'll see, a lot is yet to be
decided.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's lone goal ended a two-game 146-minute scoring
drought in the third minute following a nice finishing header from
Jolley.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vanney sent a corner kick to the far post, timing it
perfectly for Jolley, who easily beat New England goalkeeper Walter
Zenga to the near post for a 1-0 victory and the Galaxy's sixth
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jolley, part of Los Angeles' league-leading defense, isn't ready
to blame the Galaxy's sluggish start on the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not them,'' Jolley said. ``It's a long season. We're
doing our part right now, but there are going to be times when
they're going to be covering our butts. We've been fortunate
(defensively), but we're not saying we're carrying the team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now teams are defending us and not going forward, so it
makes us look good. We didn't play extremely well, but a win's a
win.
</P>
<P>
   The victory improves the Galaxy to 5-5 and moves it into fourth
place in the Western conference. New England fell to 3-6.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles had a chance to go in front 2-0 in the 24th minute,
but midfielder Clint Mathis missed a one-on-one opportunity with
Zenga, spraying his shot over the New England goal.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution midfielder Ivan McKinley broke free down the
left-side in the 28th minute. He sent a perfect cross to Giovanni
Savarese in front of the Los Angeles net, but Savarese couldn't
finish from five yards out, heading his cross away from the near
post.

LAKERS FULFILL EXPECTATIONS OF FUTILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At long last, the Los Angeles Lakers have finally fulfilled
expectations. It was in a 118-107 loss, of course, but that should
count for something.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to meet any of the positive-minded expectations the last
three years, their own or those of their fans and often adoring
media (like NBC), the Lakers can take solace that they did Sunday
what most everyone anticipated and put the final brush strokes on a
sweep at the hands of the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' Game 4 effort was flawless. They fell behind early
with a superb lack of teamwork, closed the third quarter with a
rush to create false hopes, and then gloriously crashed in the
fourth quarter as the Spurs outscored them 13-0 in the first four
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Riveting stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at things this way: While other teams move on towards
a mere NBA title in June, fans here will have all summer to argue
whether the Lakers or Dodgers are Los Angeles' biggest
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the Lakers win the debate. Sweeps are very
definitive indicators of a team's underachievement, and this is the
second year in a row that the Lakers have exited the playoffs
zero-for-four.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there's all the dramatic effect. The Lakers made sweeping
changes (sorry) this half-season in an effort to not finish the
season with a playoff bagel, and yet that's what happened again.
Thus, from now until they do otherwise, the word ``sweep'' will
accompany the Lakers wherever they go.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true for the big fella, Shaquille O'Neal,
whose teams have been swept out of the playoffs in five of six
tries (Orlando three times, Lakers twice). The only time he didn't
bagel was 1997, when the Lakers went 1-4 against Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq has seen more brooms than Mickey Mouse in ``Fantasia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very embarrassing,'' Shaq said while staring at his
shoes. ``Everytime I get sent home, I get embarrassed. This year
was a step back.''
</P>
<P>
   How true. It doesn't help that the Lakers have an uncertain
future to go with their unsatisfying past. Sunday's loss
underscored all of the Lakers' pressing issues, and they're
numerous.
</P>
<P>
   There's the defense. With Eddie Jones in Charlotte, the Lakers
have no one who plays it. The Lakers were stingy with Jones and
generous without him. And the Shaq paradox is that while he attacks
on offense, he is flat-footed on defense.
</P>
<P>
   There's the talent issue. The Lakers presumably have oodles of
it. But if so, then why do they have glaring personnel weaknesses
at point guard and power forward? With Elden Campbell and Dennis
Rodman gone, the Lakers had no one to guard Charles Barkley in the
Houston series or Tim Duncan in the Spurs' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did they expect? J.R. Reid? Robert Horry? Rick Fox?''
said the Spurs' Mario Elie, naming names of Lakers who couldn't
guard future MVP Duncan, who scored 37 and 33 points in the two
Forum games.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Lakers are so immensely talented, then why does
everyone on the roster save Kobe Bryant and Shaq look expendable?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talent,'' said Lakers general manager Jerry West after
the carnage. ``But we don't know how to win the games we need to
win. They (the Spurs) played smarter. They seemed more committed
(to their game plan).''
</P>
<P>
   That leads to the teamwork issue. The Lakers have three players
who need to see the ball a lot to be effective, and the NBA only
allows them to play with one. A share-the-wealth policy sounds
better than it plays. Shaq and Kobe had difficult co-existing, and
that was before Glen Rice showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Rice has complained since his arrival that he needs to see the
ball more. Sunday, he was 4-for-10 from the field in 45 minutes of
play. ``We got back into not passing the ball around,'' said Rice.
</P>
<P>
   But from another precinct, Shaq said, ``We got away from what we
did against Houston. The pieces all fit in the first round. When
you have a go-to guy (meaning Shaq), you have to run everything
through him.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Kobe said, ``The Spurs did what all good teams
do, make adjustments. We make adjustments, but our (offensive)
spots are always changing.''
</P>
<P>
   This leads to the coaching issue. Kurt Rambis' effort after Del
Harris was waxed was sincere, but he's overmatched, not so much by
opposing coaches as by his own players.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, perhaps trying to regenerate the Celtics-Lakers '80s
rivalry, egged Magic Johnson on Sunday about his interest in the
coaching job. Maintaining a longstanding tradition, Magic didn't
say no. For the rest of the day, NBC viewers saw more reaction
shots of Johnson than they did Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to West, who deferred questions about Rambis to
his boss, Jerry Buss, and who short-circuited questions about his
own future with ``enough has been said about my situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried instead to serve as the voice of reason. ``I want to
try not to make too much out of an awkward season,'' he said. ``We
put a lot of pressure on ourselves. We made a lot of changes that
we thought we needed to make in a very short season. Kurt was
handed one of the most difficult situations a coach has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I fear most is that the players will lash out (at each
other). Should we have made (those changes)? Should we not have? We
always push the envelope, and we always second guess ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   No more so than any of their fans. One wouldn't expect anything
less.

HERMOSILLO'S RETURN MAY PROVIDE BOOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Los Angeles Galaxy general manager Sergio Del
Prado hopes that Mexican scoring champion Carlos Hermosillo will
report soon and be ready for Los Angeles' next game at the Rose
Bowl, June 6 against Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo's Mexican club team, Necaxa, was eliminated from the
Mexican League playoffs Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Hermosillo) is looking for about a week off,'' Del Prado
said. ``He spoke to Sigi (Schmid) two weeks ago and indicated that
he would need at least one week to get himself going again.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we're hopeful we'll have him here against
Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Galaxy in the worst scoring drought in club history
before Sunday's game against New England (five goals, nine games),
Del Prado feels the Hermosillo will give Los Angeles a much-needed
spark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the team is looking for him to come in and turn some
things around,'' Del Prado said. ``If you look at our forwards,
everyone is fast and quick. We don't have a physical presence, but
that's what Carlos will bring us.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott comes aboard: New Zealand national team midfielder Simon
Elliott joined the Galaxy on Saturday, becoming the team's fourth
foreign-allocated player after the club waived 17-year-old
Ecuadoran Jaime Caicedo last week.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who has been training with the Galaxy this past week,
was in uniform Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very happy to add Simon to our roster,'' Schmid said.
``He is very good with either foot and can play anywhere in the
midfield. He is not a typical player coming out of college, having
gained plenty of international experience with the New Zealand
national team.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid is aware of what Elliott can do. The 24-year-old faced
Schmid's UCLA teams while playing at Stanford.

A REAL-LIFE PHANTOM MENACE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking refuge from the violence and chaos of the real world, I
ducked into a theater for a couple hours of soothing make-believe
violence and chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Light-saber battles, wall-shaking sound, flying objects and
crazy characters from strange worlds! Then the movie started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' is good, and not just for the gimmicks. There
are lessons of hope. If our species manages to survive, evolve and
develop its innate intelligence and technology, some day our
ancestors will kill one another in much cooler ways than we do now.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no ``Star Wars'' expert, so I was plot-lost in space. The
cute kid star of ``Phantom Menace'' is, I assumed, the future Luke
Skywalker.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong! I'm told that the boy, so full of lofty ideals, is
destined to choose a murkier path. In the next movie he becomes
Richard Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Also to come, Yoda mates with Poppin' Fresh to produce E.T.,
inventor of the cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The movie does inspire contemplation of spiritual themes. Like,
despite our seeming insignificance in the vast sea of the cosmos,
one person, one teensy flyspeck in the galaxy, truly can make a
difference, can provide hope. I'm referring to my neighbor Ed, who
let me cut into the ticket line.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is lifelike. Viewers gave a huge cheer to Yoda, the
wise and kindly whatsit. We all wish our country had a leader who
was a Wookie instead of Nookie.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to separate the ``Phantom Menace'' from the menacing
phantom, Darth Milosevic. Like the bad guys in the movie, Milosevic
is unreasonable, power-crazed, won't negotiate. Dirty politics are
involved on both sides, and much violence ensues, including the
displacement and slaughter of entire ethnic populations.
</P>
<P>
   George Lucas should sue NATO and Milosevic for plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   One difference: NATO bombs keep falling on wrong targets. Or are
those really mistakes?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who NATO would be if it was a former baseball
pitcher?'' asks a caller named The Old Homeboy. ``Ryne Duren.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. Ryne Duren had a hellacious fastball, Mr. Magoo
eyesight and a drinking problem. Duren's first warm-up pitch
invariably whistled 10 feet over the catcher's head. Batters
trembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intimidation,`' says Homeboy. ``It's, `You can't trust us
because we don't know what we're doing, either. We don't know what
we might hit by accident.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton wants NATO to send 50,000 troops to Kosovo as
``peacekeepers.'' What peace? Why not send 50,000 ``peacefinders''?
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Star Wars'' galaxy, there is no gun control, and how
will Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer handle this? Both are pro
gun-control but anti any attempt to rein in Hollywood violence.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be because both senators were elected with Hollywood
money?
</P>
<P>
   Recent headline: ``Gun bill votes reflected NRA contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is misleading because it could just as well be
flip-flopped: ``NRA contributions reflected gun-bill votes.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the cause and effect? In the end, both sides vote their
wallet.
</P>
<P>
   I support gun control because I'd rather be attacked with a
light saber than an assault weapon. The gun lobby says citizens
need military weapons because our government might attack us. But
our government has nuclear weapons, so we all need to upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In a bar in L.A. last week, S.F. guy Lee Houskeeper found
himself chatting amiably with Charlton Heston, until Lee asked,
``How would you feel about every citizen owning a nuclear bomb?''
</P>
<P>
   Happy hour ended abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the ``Phantom Menace'' villain whose photo is on
this column was correctly identified by reader Alex Elko. No, it's
not Java the Putz. It is Ginko Biloba.

CRUSADE AIMS TO LOWER AIDS DRUGS COST
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ In the 18 years since he first showed symptoms
of AIDS, Eric Sawyer has been a fighter, battling his own disease
while agitating on the streets and in the halls of Congress for
more research and better drugs.
<P>
   The payoff is an array of costly new pills that since 1996 have
helped slash the American AIDS death rate in half, and restored
vigor and good health to Sawyer and tens of thousands like him.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new cause is tapping the fresh energy and political
instincts of American AIDS veterans, whose work succeeded in
changing U.S. drug approval policy. They are helping in an
international movement to let Third World nations make cut-rate
copies of the life-saving drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are no longer burying your friends, you have the
luxury of time to try to save people in more remote areas,'' said
Sawyer, a co-founder of ACT UP/New York. ``There is a tremendous
sense of survivor guilt, which gives us inspiration to fight
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is this: At Western market prices of $1,000 a month,
the multidrug therapies are hopelessly out of reach in the very
countries hit hardest by the epidemic _ in African and other
developing nations where 90 percent of AIDS cases occur.
</P>
<P>
   Activists such as Sawyer, director of a new group called the
HIV/AIDS and Human Rights Project, think they have found a
solution:
</P>
<P>
   By declaring health emergencies, impoverished countries could
sidestep patent laws and produce or import these drugs at a
fraction of the cost, making them available to millions of
destitute AIDS victims _ a market that big drug companies would
never touch.
</P>
<P>
   But the quest to flood Africa with cheap AIDS drugs has run
headlong into conflict with American trade policy. High level
Clinton administration officials are blocking attempts to tamper
with AIDS drug patents, saying that they undermine the entire
system of intellectual property protection that encourages
businesses to find new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best examples of this new front in the battle over
AIDS drugs is South Africa, where a recently enacted law would
override pharmaceutical company patents and allow ``gray market''
imports of cheap drugs from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drug prices vary dramatically from country to
country, based on deals cut by the manufacturer. The antibiotic
Amoxicillin, for example, costs 50 cents a pill in Johannesburg, 4
cents in Zimbabwe. The South African law would let the country
pursue the lowest cost drugs on the world market.
</P>
<P>
   But court challenges have delayed the law's being put into
effect. Also, U.S. officials are threatening trade sanctions. One
State Department memo to Congress boasted of a ``full court press''
involving the Vice President Al Gore, Commerce Secretary William
Daley and four U.S. agencies to change the ``offending'' law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. government has ... made it clear that it will defend
the legitimate interests and rights of U.S. pharmaceutical firms,''
wrote State Department assistant secretary Barbara Larkin in her
letter to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran AIDS activists are angry. The Clinton administration,
they charge, seems content to let multinational drug companies set
American trade policy _ which is threatening access to life-saving
medicines, not only in South Africa, but also in Thailand, India
and poor countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharmacy companies are making U.S. government policy with
essentially no other voices. That has to change,'' said John James,
editor of the respected San Francisco newsletter AIDS Treatment
News.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies have all but ignored markets in Africa. Less than
1 percent of AIDS drugs are sold in African nations south of the
Sahara Desert, where 70 percent of new HIV infections and 90
percent of all AIDS deaths occur. Some 11.5 million people in
sub-Saharan Africa have died of AIDS since the epidemic began.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ian Roberts, special adviser to the South African Health
Ministry, said the United States is showing little understanding of
his country's public health catastrophe. ``Medicines to treat
HIV/AIDS are far too highly priced for the mass of our people,'' he
said. ``With up to 16 percent of our people already HIV positive,
this can be seen as a national disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite South Africa's gold and diamond mines, most of its
people remain poor, with an average annual income of $2,600.
``Clearly, we cannot afford retrovirals at a cost of $1,000 per
month,'' said Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has emerged from the shadow of apartheid only to
become a major center of the AIDS epidemic. An estimated 3.2
million South Africans are infected by the virus, including 45
percent of the nation's military personnel. Most of those infected
are poor and black.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who was drawn to the issue
because of his long-standing interest in pharmaceutical regulation,
called the Clinton position on South Africa ``an affront to the
sovereignty of Third World nations.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sharply worded letter to Gore, who chairs a commission on
South African trade, Nader accused the United States of abusing its
superpower status: ``You have engaged in an astonishing array of
bullying tactics to prevent South Africa from implementing policies
... designed to expand access to HIV/AIDS drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader's Consumer Project on Technology advocates two steps _
both of them legal under international law _ by which poor
countries can slash the cost of AIDS drugs. The first is for poor
countries to issue ``compulsory licenses,'' granting rights to make
copies of patented drugs without the approval of the patent holder.
Compulsory licenses are permitted in health emergencies under
international trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The second step is to allow countries to shop around on the
international market for AIDS drugs and import the cheapest
available. Forbidden in the United States, such ``parallel market''
or ``gray market'' purchases are routinely permitted in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compulsory licensing will have huge effects on price, leading
to decreases of 50 to 90 percent,'' said James Love, director of
the Consumer Project on Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the pharmaceutical industry and the Clinton administration
take the view that compulsory licenses and gray markets pose a
threat to the entire system of intellectual property protection.
Access to AIDS drugs, they say, can be solved without destroying
the patent system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patents are the lifeblood of our industry,'' said David Warr,
associate director of tax and trade policy at Bristol-Myers Squibb,
the New York-based maker of an array of drugs to treat AIDS and
AIDS-related infections. ``Compulsory licensing and parallel
imports expropriate our patent rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The only beneficiary of an erosion of patent rights, said Warr,
is the generic drug industry, which does not subsidize through its
sales the costly process of research _ research that makes new
top-of-the-line therapies available. ``There is a need not to fight
the firefighters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers stress that even if AIDS medications were magically
made cheaper for the African market, the lack of an infrastructure
to distribute the drugs and monitor patients means that few would
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bombelles, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers Association, said patents are not the problem. Access
to AIDS drugs remains a desperate problem in India, which does not
recognize international drug patents and where manufacturers make
low-cost generic versions of AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in the international AIDS crisis agree that merely
lowering the price of AIDS drugs will not solve the problem, and
potentially could make the epidemic worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spread anti-HIV drugs in a population, but not in
sufficient quantities, you are establishing a recipe for disaster.
You could make people sicker, rather than better, and increase the
possibility for development of drug-resistant HIV strains,'' said
Tom Coates, executive director of the University of California at
San Francisco AIDS Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Coates said the limited money available to fight AIDS in Africa
would save the most lives if it were directed at prevention first.
Most African nations do not even have funds to pay for testing of
the blood supply, and in 1997, only $650 million was spent on all
African AIDS programs. ``If, as UNAIDS (the Joint United Nations
Programme on HIV/AIDS) has suggested, we raised spending to $2.5
billion, we could prevent half the HIV infections from occurring,''
Coates said.
</P>
<P>
   By raising the patent issue, however, activists believe they are
already nudging the international pharmaceutical industry to pay
more attention to Africa. This month, Bristol-Myers Squibb
announced a five-year, $100 million project to test AIDS drugs and
improve physician training in five African nations, including South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But angry South African officials have dismissed the drug
company program as misplaced. The country does not have doctors to
spare for training in the United States, said Roberts, the adviser
to the South African Health Ministry. And critics consider the
offer a public relations ploy. ``They are getting billions more
than they should with their monopoly, so they send back a tip,''
sniffed Nader.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the Bristol-Myers grant has nevertheless upped the
ante in the international response to the AIDS catastrophe in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The controversies swirling around U.S. trade policies indicates
that a new front has been opened in the global war on AIDS. Even as
new AIDS medicines save lives in the United States, they serve to
underscore the appalling medical gap between rich nations and poor.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Zingale, executive director of the AIDS Action Council,
the nation's largest lobby on HIV issues, said the trade issues
raised by Nader are looming larger. ``In my view, on this issue,
Ralph Nader is right,'' he said. ``It's clear to us the pricing of
AIDS drugs is not fair or serving the interests of most people
infected by HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect of American trade policy on the availability of AIDS
drugs has already struck a chord on Capitol Hill. Rep. Jesse
Jackson Jr., D-Ill., has introduced an African trade bill that bars
U.S. trade sanctions against countries that use compulsory
licensing or parallel imports.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Marion Berry, an Arkansas Democrat and the only
licensed pharmacist in Congress _ who has long been a thorn in the
side of U.S. drugmakers _ is winning support with his criticism of
the Clinton administration stand.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he introduced a bill, with Republican Jo Ann Emerson
of Missouri as co-author, that would allow American wholesalers to
import drugs sold in Mexico or Canada at lower prices than those
set by pharmaceutical companies for the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in favor of these companies making a profit,'' Berry
said in a recent telephone interview. ``We all want them to make as
much money as possibly can. But when they make money at the expense
of someone dying, because they can't afford to buy the medicine _
well, then it becomes a moral issue.''

 SPAIN FACING ITS OWN FEARS ON SEPARATISM  &HT;     By FRANK VIVIANO 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  BILBAO, Spain _ As NATO rushes troops and equipment to the
Balkans, a powerful ethnic separatist movement is building toward a
showdown on the Alliance's own Atlantic flank.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with unprecedented political opposition and public
anger, Spanish rule in Basque country is close to foundering _
adding a Western European chapter to the breakups that have
shattered Yugoslavia and other Eastern European countries since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, a unified Basque-nationalist regional
government was elected in October, following the declaration of a
cease-fire by ETA, the underground separatist army that has waged a
bloody 30-year war against Madrid. The cease-fire was answered by
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar with a hard-line crackdown, deeply
alienating most voters and ending decades of cooperation between
Basque moderates and Spanish political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make gestures. I apply the law,'' Aznar says about his
refusal to meet the cease-fire with conciliatory measures, much
less peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's essentially no contact anymore between our people and
the central government,'' says Gorka Agirre, a leader of the
mainstream Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) in Bilbao, the region's
largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fathers and grandfathers could only &LR;   &LR; dream of a free
Basque land. My generation believes that we will actually create
one,'' says Dabid Lizarralde, 21, a university student in the
coastal town of Algorta, 10 miles north of Bilbao, as long-distance
runners swept by in a province-wide race organized to support
Basque language studies.
</P>
<P>
   The runners, backed by $35 donations for each kilometer, were
diverted around the town center to avoid colliding with a parade
sponsored by Herri Batasuna, the political arm of ETA. They passed
directly in front of an 8 p.m. demonstration by parents of Basque
political prisoners that has occupied Algorta's main intersection
every evening for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of the town's 13 sons and daughters in Spanish prisons
were posted in taverns, restaurants and shops. Greeted by musicians
playing Basque folk songs on traditional instruments, crowds of
people poured out of the local railroad station from yet other
demonstrations in Bilbao, including a silent protest march that
blocks the city's principal thoroughfare each Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Basque country in 1999 recalls Prague or Budapest a decade ago,
when endless demonstrations and a sense of history-in-the-making
brought ordinary life to a giddy standstill.
</P>
<P>
   There are echoes, too, of the violent Kurdish separatist war
that has killed thousands in Turkey, and of stubborn ethnic
nationalist movements that have troubled other NATO governments
during the past few years in Scotland and Wales, Corsica, northern
Italy, Flemish Belgium and Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Basque nationalists follow all of these movements closely, and
maintain quasi-diplomatic relations with several, in what amounts
to a de facto alliance of ``stateless nations'' inside NATO that
stretches from the British Isles to the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The new regional government has invited the outlawed Kurdish
parliament to convene in Bilbao in July, and it protested the sales
of arms manufactured by Spanish firms in Basque country to the
Turkish government. Madrid has officially prohibited the
convention, setting the stage for a confrontation over Basque ties
to the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   But the closest kinship is with Ireland, where the very
institutions and tactics of separatist rebellion are cut from the
same cloth _ and where the connection has a six-decade history,
speaks in the lilting brogue of Dublin and has a Basque family
name: Gallastegi.
</P>
<P>
   Now an energetic 73, Iker Gallastegi arrived in Ireland in
September 1937 at age 10 with his parents and five siblings. It was
the height of the Spanish Civil War, and Basque country was in
flames.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Gallastegi, Iker's father, was a leading Basque nationalist,
singled out for liquidation by General Francisco Franco's Fascists
when the family fled Spain. Dublin was already his second home.
Inspired by the stubborn Irish fight for independence, the elder
Gallastegi had written a history of the 1916 Easter Rising against
British rule, and in 1932 founded a trading firm in Bilbao to
import eggs, potatoes and pork from the young Irish Free State.
</P>
<P>
   In their Dublin exile, the Gallastegi children were raised on an
uncompromising mixture of Basque separatism and Irish
republicanism. Eventually, that education led Iker himself to
return to Basque country as a young nationalist organizer in 1952
under an assumed name, and to flee once again just ahead of
Franco's police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to beat the dust in 1952,'' he says. ``It was 17 years
before I was able to return home, after Franco was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebellious family tradition has carried into the next
generation. Gallastegi's daughter Usune, 35, has been in a Spanish
prison since 1994, sentenced to an eight-year term for
``collaborating with terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges between Ireland and Basque country that began with
the Gallastegis continue at a brisk clip today. ``We're not
married, but you could surely say that we are living together,''
says Gallastegi.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a set of matched political structures that frame,
in tandem, Western Europe's two oldest ethnic nationalist
movements.
</P>
<P>
   The relationships between the underground ETA and Herri Batasuna
_ and major elements in their strategy, training and recruitment
methods _ are mirror images of the relationship between Sinn Fein,
the militant but legal Irish political party, and its own armed
wing, the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has made at least half a dozen
visits to Bilbao, according to Herri Batasuna officials, and other
high-ranking members of the two parties consult regularly on
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   During several assignments in and around Belfast in recent
years, a Chronicle reporter encountered visiting groups of
militants from Jarrai, the Herri Batasuna youth organization,
boisterously participating in Republican political demonstrations.
So boisterously, in fact, that republican leaders were obliged to
restrain the young Basques, who in one instance tried to lead a
headlong charge against police lines.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish police charge that these visits include military field
training under IRA supervision, and they allege that Jarrai is
behind a spate of firebombings directed at officials of Aznar's
conservative People's Party in Basque country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the ties extend to a working relationship between
ETA and IRA on some level. There's a tremendous amount of traffic
back and forth between Bilbao and Belfast,'' acknowledges a Basque
leader, speaking off the record. ``But that's not something to be
discussed publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   As in Northern Ireland, where the Royal Ulster Constabulary is
effectively a Protestant police force, Basques face a law
enforcement agency _ Spain's Guardia Civil _ that employs virtually
no members of its own community.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another echo of Irish Republican tactics, Herri Batasuna
has compiled lengthy lists of unmarked police car license plate
numbers and has posted them in popular taverns run by the party in
nearly every Basque town and village.
</P>
<P>
   Like its significant other in Ireland, Herri Batasuna ran
candidates in regional elections for three decades, only to decline
the seats it won in protest against ``foreign rule.'' Then, last
year, the IRA declared a permanent cease-fire, and Sinn Fein sat
down at the negotiating table with its adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, ETA and Herri Batasuna followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a dramatic September meeting in the city of
Lizarra, 70 miles south of Bilbao, at which all nine nationalist
political parties and 14 Basque labor and cultural organizations
issued a joint declaration calling for multiparty negotiations
toward self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Lizarra, the football field had always been the Spanish
state,'' says Eusebio Lasa, a member of Herri Batasuna's national
council. ``What we decided at Lizarra is that the field must be
Basque country itself _ that the future should be up to the Basque
people and not simply concessions from officials in Madrid.''
</P>
<P>
   Modeled consciously on the Good Friday Agreement in Northern
Ireland, the Lizarra Declaration set the stage for the election,
one month later, that ushered in the unprecedented nationalist-run
regional government.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the moderate PNV, Herri Batasuna and a third
nationalist party now hold 41 seats in the regional parliament,
against 30 for the People's Party (PP) and the Socialists. ``The
situation has changed enormously,'' says Gorka Agirre of the PNV,
which leads the new governing coalition, the first in history not
to include either the Socialist Party or the PP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree now (with Herri Batasuna) that there was no great
difference between those two parties when it came to Basques.
Neither was interested in talking about a different future here,
about any real self-determination,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   PNV leaders point out that few, if any, regional autonomy
measures promised as long ago as the 1970s were implemented when
the Socialists or conservatives were part of the regional governing
coalition. According to the Spanish constitution, even a referendum
on self-determination in Basque country remains strictly against
the law.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Irish experience no longer fits the Basque
reality. The Good Friday Agreement was reached under the auspices
of a British government desperate to extricate itself from the
Northern Ireland quagmire, and more than happy to have the end game
played in Belfast rather than London.
</P>
<P>
   The problems since in implementing self-rule in Northern Ireland
have not come from 10 Downing Street, but from die-hard factions
within the unionist and republican camps.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, there is no war in Basque country between
communities, no exchange of atrocities between Bilbao versions of
the Catholic and Protestant gunmen who haunt Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enemy isn't the Spanish lad next door,'' says Gallastegi.
``It's the national state,'' in the form of a central government
that responded to the historic cease-fire by arresting the very
people with whom it must negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I arrived in power, I said, `I will never talk with ETA.'
If there is no peace, ETA and ETA alone will be responsible,'' says
Aznar, pointing out that ETA has been responsible for more than 800
killings in the past three decades, mostly of government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there is peace, there is discussion. Without discussion,
there is no place for peace,'' counters the Rev. Pierre Moleres,
bishop of the predominantly Basque city of Bayonne in France.
Moleres' offer to help arrange negotiations was rejected by the
Aznar government, which opposes any international mediation in the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown began just as Basque nationalists were laying the
groundwork for the cease-fire in October 1997, when the entire
23-member leadership council of Herri Batasuna was sentenced to
lengthy jail terms for distributing a video that presented ETA's
terms for peace. According to many observers, the imprisoned
council members were the most negotiation-minded of the
organization's factions to hold sway in years. They join more than
500 Basque political activists now in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, ETA militants have been found dead, under suspicious
circumstances that recall the work of secret assassination squads
in the 1980s that were linked to the Socialist government of Felipe
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, under pressure from Madrid, French police rounded
up six more nationalist leaders in Paris. Gallastegi's niece
Irantzu, a key figure in the ETA bid for peace, was one of those
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every effort we've made to search an accord with Aznar, to
promote dialogue, has been negative,'' says PNV's Agirre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, I want peace,'' Aznar insists. ``But they are trying to
obtain independence. That's the difference between us.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: We must try genetic engineering _ but beware of the
butterflies
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The short story, as I recollect it, was set in a future where
time travel had become possible. A fellow signed up to tour the
primeval past and, like others, was cautioned to remain on the
floating path and to touch nothing, because even the smallest
alteration in the past could have huge consequences. He made the
trip and marveled at the exotic plants and creatures of an era
beyond reckoning. He scrupulously stayed on the path, but returned
to his own time to find everything changed grotesquely, and in no
way for the better. Puzzled, he sat down, only to discover, from
the evidence on his shoe sole, that in the ancient past he had
stepped on a butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   The tale came back recently with the news that a study has found
that a popular new corn, genetically altered to ward off insect
pests but believed harmless to other insects, produces a pollen
that kills monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to know quite what to make of this, so far. The
pollen is quite toxic to monarchs exposed to it in the laboratory,
but it is not clear whether many of the butterflies encounter it in
the fields. The real danger may be quite small, or not quite small.
No one knows.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone does know this: monarch butterflies are lovely, one
of those occasions of grace that the same nature which produces
droughts and volcanoes and other tumults tosses off casually, as if
to make up in small things for its larger lapses.
</P>
<P>
   The science of genetics is beyond me. Hell, I haven't even
figured out radio; magic seems the best explanation for it. And I
am not among the instinctive naysayers who, like the Luddites,
would smash every novelty out of fear it surely will bring more ill
than good. The status quo, by definition, won't get us anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   There are risks in any change and we are reaching a point, as I
understand it, where our cleverness may offer us huge changes from
this still new science and bring them ever faster. Genetic
engineering holds the promise, among other benefits, of more food,
more safely produced. This corn, for instance, lets farmers forgo
pesticides. That's good.
</P>
<P>
   But such is our vanity, forever triumphing over our experience,
that we believe in our ability to extrapolate all the consequences
of our innovations, and to judge each good or not and weigh the
balance soundly.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who would so straiten genetic engineering that
it could barely move. Never mind that it might _ just might _ be
the technology that ends illness and hunger and the human strifes,
from bellyache to war, that come of those.
</P>
<P>
   The same science that is improving corn harvests has been
approved for growing potatoes and cotton, too. I suppose we must
now wonder whether there will be side effects we regret. Even the
canniest science cannot repeal the law of unintended consequences,
but mere alarmism does more to stymie than to guide. We have to
try. It is in us to try.
</P>
<P>
   We must be careful, though, not to step on the butterflies.

for Sunday, May 23, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.

   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   DULL-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ If America wants for bland,
Al Gore is the man. He is considerably less colorful than the man
he hopes to succeed. But many of the hottest politicians these days
are the coldest, perhaps because `boring' can be interpreted as
`reliable' and `no surprises.' California Gov. Gray Davis, New York
Gov. George Pataki and even Texas Gov. George W. Bush are among
successful politicians noted for their blandness. By Richard L.
Berke. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-POLITICS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ The assassination of
Yitzhak Rabin was an undigested trauma for many Israelis, and that
Ehud Barak's victory allowed a kind of public catharsis of
repressed grief over a national martyr whose death at the hands of
an extremist Jew changed the way many Israelis felt about being
Israeli. Now Ehud must depart from the model of his mentor and try
to learn from his mistakes. By Deborah Sontag. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-SHIFT-REVIEW (Washington) _ In constitutional law, as in
geology, things can look stable on the surface _ until the tectonic
plates shift underneath. In its decision voiding California's
reduced welfare aid for newcomers to the state, the Supreme Court
used a portion of the 14th Amendment barring states from
restricting `privileges or immunities' of citizens. The sudden
resurrection of this long-neglected clause was one of the most
surprising and most consequential constitutional developments in
years. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   TV-NEWSHOWS-REVIEW (New York) _ Unveiling next season's network
lineups: what made the annual rite of spring so bleak was the
degree of cynicism and self-satisfaction among TV executives and
writer-producers who proudly showed off their newest sitcoms and
seemed in denial over just how terrible they were. The faint scent
of doom in the air _ that of the networks watching their audiences
erode with the growth of the Internet and cable _ failed to dampen
the strange euphoria. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-YEARBOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Excerpts from the Class of '99
yearbook at Columbine High School, where the shooting masacre took
place in April. Students write that their lives had been profoundly
and irreversibly changed.
</P>
<P>
   GUNS-POLITICS-REVIEW _ The new politics of guns, if there is
one. By David E. Rosenbaum. (details to come)
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week, leading
with the revival of whaling by Indians in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   ESPIONAGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ There seems little doubt doubt that
China's theft of secrets from U.S. nuclear weapons labs had led to
spectacular gains by China in creating a modern thermonuclear
arsenal. Yet no one has been charged with espionage or any other
crime. Veterans of espionage investigations offer a variety of
explanations for the government's inability to proceed in the case.
They say that espionage cases have always been among the most
difficult because of the highly covert nature of the crime. By
David Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBALIZE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Globalization is thought to be a
new and powerful force that is erasing national borders and linking
the world in an unprecedented web of trade and investments. But
perhaps the greatest myth about globalization is that it is new. By
some measures, its peak occurred a century ago, making the 20th
century memorable in economic history mostly for its retreat from
globalization. In some respects, only now is the world economy
becoming roughly as interlinked as it was more than a century ago.
By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-BLAIR-REVIEW (London) _ British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's foreign policies have provoked strong opinions and raised
questions about what is becoming of Britain. Views range from
approval of resurgent British brawn and influence to outright
condemnation of policies seen as fatuous and foolhardy for a
country that no longer has the station or resources to act on its
own and expect others to follow. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-HONGKONG-REVIEW (Hong Kong) _ China's newest city is
crowded, expensive, polluted and mired in recession. And yet to
listen to Hong Kong's leaders, every person in mainland China with
the slightest claim to live here would scramble across the border
if the gates were opened. Hong Kong is in a lather over the
prospect that it is about to be inundated by migrants from mainland
China. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-OUTLOOK-REVIEW (Rio de Janeiro) _ The Brazilian financial
crisis seems to have passed, and investors and foreign leaders are
regaining confidence. Still unaddressed, however, is a more
fundamental issue: to what extent did the crisis reflect real
deficiencies in the Brazilian economy and to what degree was it a
self-fulfilling prophecy, brought on by panic and myopia in the
global capital market itself? By Larry Rohter.

fundamental issue: to what extent did the crisis reflect real
deficiencies in the Brazilian economy and to what degree was it a
self-fulfilling prophecy, brought on by panic and myopia in the
global capital market itself? By Larry Rohter.

   A New Furor Over an Old Whaling Tradition
</P>
<P>
   The gray whales that migrate from Mexico to the Bering Sea were
driven to the edge of extinction by commercial whaling by the
1920s. That is when the Makah Indians, who live at the very
northwestern tip of the lower 48 states and had relied on the
whales for a large part of their diet for centuries, stopped
hunting the grays.
</P>
<P>
   But the whale population recovered and now numbers at least
25,000, so the Makah decided to revive their tribal tradition of
whaling, around which many ceremonies, legends and songs were
built. Last week the Pacific Ocean near Father and Son Rocks, just
off Olympic National Park in Washington, turned red when tribal
hunters harpooned and then shot a 30-ton female whale with a
.50-caliber assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   The Makah are likely to conduct more hunts: Under an
international pact, they can kill up to 20 whales over the next
four years for ``subsistence or ceremonial purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups, torn between a desire to protect the
whales and respect for the ancient Indian traditions invoked by the
Makah, took no position on the hunt, while others said the whales'
real enemy was not the Makah but commercial whalers in other parts
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But other groups expressed outrage. ``We're obviously very upset
that the Makah went ahead with killing an innocent sentient
creature in such a bloody and untraditional way,'' the Sea Defense
Alliance said.
</P>
<P>
   Makah leaders were jubilant about what they called a cultural
revival but also angered by the criticism. ``Why don't people
question other cultures?'' asked the tribal chairman, Ben Johnson
Jr., who said the rifle was used only to hasten the whale's death.
``They're going over us with a fine-tooth comb.''

   Yeltsin Gambles and Comes Out Ahead
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin won impressive tactical victories on two
fronts _ not bad for an unpopular leader who just a few months ago
was being written off as an ailing and erratic figurehead. First
came the fizzling of a long-threatened impeachment drive headed by
his Communist-led opposition, followed a few days later by the easy
approval of his new prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, in the
Communist-dominated Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Having regained the initiative, Yeltsin now has to get back to
governing. His first move was to pointedly remind Stepashin that
all Cabinet appointments must be cleared with the Kremlin. His
second was to head south to the Black Sea for a two-week vacation.

   Guilty Plea by Fund-Raiser
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department got a lift in its campaign finance
inquiry when a Democratic fund-raiser and Arkansas friend of
President Clinton pleaded guilty in federal court to two political
fund-raising charges. Yah Lin Trie, a Taiwan-born naturalized
American citizen known as Charlie, also agreed to cooperate with
the department in its investigation into the financing of Clinton's
1996 campaign.

   The plea came three days after a federal appeals court

<P>
   For the seventh consecutive year, crime in the United States

Violent crimes and property crimes each fell 7 percent, declines
criminologists attributed to several factors, including an
expanding economy, a larger prison population and a lower demand
for crack cocaine.

   Gandhi Roils Indian Politics
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party, once India's dominant political force,
appeared to be poised to make electoral gains in general elections
this September, but the abrupt resignation of the party's
president, Sonia Gandhi, has thrown all political calculations into
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi, who married into an Indian political dynasty, quit
after three rebellious leaders in the party openly opposed her
candidacy for prime minister because she was born in Italy. The
leaders were expelled from the party later in the week.

   New Deal on Korea Sanctions
</P>
<P>
   Since the Korean War ended in stalemate in 1953, Washington's
approach to North Korea has been pretty straightforward: Isolate
the place, and hope it will collapse in Stalinist rubble. But
somehow it has held together, starving but building missiles and
aspiring to build nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes former Defense Secretary William Perry, who arrives in
Pyongyang this week with a new deal as the first-ever presidential
envoy: Give up your long-range missile program, stop exporting arms
and forget about the nukes. In return, Washington would start
lifting its economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal would require the world's most isolated country to
open up, a move it has always resisted.

more than ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' took in two years ago.
Armed with galactic hype, ``The Phantom Menace'' didn't need any

to strip U.S. citizenship from John Demjanjuk, a 79-year-old
retired autoworker.

   The government, which has sought to deport Demjanjuk for 22

Terrible, who drove thousands of victims into gas chambers.

   Elizabeth Dole said her husband, Bob, was in ``the family
woodshed'' for his less-than-supportive remarks about her campaign
for the Republican presidential nomination published early last
week in The New York Times. Dole even said he was thinking of
contributing to one of her rivals, Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more. Here are outtakes from that interview:
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Mrs. Dole would hold steady in polls as the No. 2
behind Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Dole responded with a nod to
McCain. ``There was some New Hampshire poll that she and John
McCain were close,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he or Mrs. Dole was more popular on the trail,
Dole passed up an opportunity to make a pitch for the candidate.
``We haven't had one of those tests yet,'' he said. ``There hasn't
been a place where they introduced me and introduced her and had
the applause meter on.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to rate the chances that Mrs. Dole would capture the
nomination, he said: ``I don't know. It's too early. Ask me that in
six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole said he missed the thrill of the campaign that his wife is
now enjoying. ``It's like the old mailman who goes for a walk every
day when he retires,'' he said. ``Once it's in your blood, you want
to go out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole was only half joking when he said he regretted turning over
his political action committee in 1996 to one of his wife's future
rivals, former Vice President Dan Quayle. ``I probably should have
put it in a trust,'' he said. Dole also mocked President Clinton
for giving an interview recently about Vice President Al Gore's
political weaknesses. ``Letterman and Leno are going to have a
ball!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Little did he know they would have a ball at the expense of both
Clinton and Dole for speaking out of school.

   &UR; DESPERATE CHARACTERS &LR;  By Paula Fox. Norton, $12. In this trim,
intensely focused 1970 novel, an upper-middle-class New York woman
is bitten on the hand by a stray cat, setting off a chain of events
that mirror the confusion and bitterness in her loveless marriage.
The New York Times reviewer Peter Rowley praised ``the skillful
insistency with which Fox probes her characters' lives'' and ``her
acute sense of individual and social psychology.''

   &UR; A SOLDIER'S STORY &LR;  By Omar N. Bradley. Modern Library, $17.95.
As the commander of more soldiers in the field than any other
officer in American history, General of the Army Omar Bradley was
uniquely placed to assess the ups and downs of the European
campaign in World War II. ``The highest service'' of his candid,
balanced memoir, Hanson W. Baldwin wrote in 1951, ``is to provide a
gallery of military portraits, a background of personalities,
against which the war in North Africa, Sicily, France and Germany
was fought.''

and the grunts and officers he encountered along the way. Reviewing
this ``fine narrative'' in 1946, Charles Poore said, ``You have an
eerie feeling ... that he wandered untrammeled from one end of the
war to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GIVE US THIS DAY &LR; , by Sidney Stewart (Norton, $13.95), is a
harrowing narrative of the Pacific war by an American enlisted man
who survived the Bataan Death March and three years in Japanese
captivity. ``Through its immense picture of human courage in the
face of suffering, it reinforces our faith in the ultimate triumph
of man's spirit,'' David Dempsey wrote in 1957. ``It is
unforgettable.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TREATMENT &LR;  By Daniel Menaker. Washington Square/Pocket
Books, $14. Jake Singer is motherless, aimless and lonely, but his
biggest challenge may be coping with his ferocious Cuban Catholic
analyst, who sees himself as ``the last Freudian.'' Last year the
reviewer Jim Shepard called this first novel ``an ethically
instructive comedy'' that is ``admirable for both its craft and its
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEACH: THE HISTORY OF PARADISE ON EARTH &LR;  By Lena Lencek and
Gideon Bosker. Penguin, $13.95. This eccentric chronicle of beach
culture from the Romans to the Californians includes a bibliography
with 335 entries and the authors' picks of the world's top 80
resorts. The result is an ``entertaining, handsomely illustrated
book'' that manages to be both ``scholarly and briskly
good-humored,'' Alexander Frater wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PHILISTINES AT THE HEDGEROW: PASSION AND PROPERTY IN THE
HAMPTONS &LR; , by Steven Gaines (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.95),
explores life on the eastern tip of Long Island, N.Y., and the
parade of artists, charmers, socialites and celebrities who have
walked its beaches. In 1998 the reviewer Jennifer Steinhauer found
the book to be overstuffed with gossip but said it featured
``engaging ... tales of the social, ethnic and architectural
history of one of the most exclusive summer resort areas in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN SEARCH OF LOVE AND BEAUTY &LR;  By Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.
Counterpoint, $14. The author's first work of fiction set in
America focuses on a charismatic European refugee who becomes a
guru in New York, and the circle of uprooted ladies to whose bodies
and souls he ministers. In 1983 Robert Towers called this ``a
macabre comedy of impulsive, thwarted lives'' and said ``Jhabvala
renders a little world of emotional, greedy refugees with much
shrewdness of insight.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has also reissued  &UR; HEAT AND DUST &LR;  ($14), an
earlier novel by Jhabvala that revolves around a restless young
British woman who moves to India with her husband in the 1920s and
quickly goes native, falling under the sway of a charming Indian
prince. In 1976 the reviewer Pearl K. Bell said the author depicts
``the barriers of incomprehension and futility that persist between
English and Indians with witty precision.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANE AUSTEN: A LIFE &LR;  By Claire Tomalin. Vintage, $14. The
latest take on the British novelist holds that her life was more
exciting, traumatic and adventurous than previous biographies have
allowed. In 1997 the reviewer Kevin Barry said that while the
approach is overly speculative, ``it is Tomalin's overt intention
to present us with a Jane Austen living on the edge of a mobile
world.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GAFF TOPSAILS &LR;  By Patrick Kavanagh. Penguin, $13.95. The ghost
of ``Ulysses'' hovers over this first novel, which traces a day in
the life of several people _ among them a bitter priest and a
dreamy teen-age girl _ who inhabit an Irish Catholic parish on the
coast of Newfoundland in 1948. ``The narrative swoops down, like a
sea gull, on each character,'' Courtney Weaver wrote last year.
``Like Joyce, Kavanagh uses language as a metaphor for the division
of souls and of countries.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FREE LIVE FREE &LR;  By Gene Wolfe. Orb/Tom Doherty, $15.95. This
science-fiction tale centers on a detective, a prostitute, a
salesman and a witch who are lured by a mysterious man to a Chicago
house slated to be demolished. ``The plot ... is full of surprises
that I can't even hint at without ruining the pleasure of discovery
that awaits those who enter the worlds that Wolfe creates,'' Gerald
Jonas wrote in 1985.

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending May 15 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such

subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Help, I'm being held prisoner in a . . .
 &HT;    For release May 26, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a private message to the State Department:
</P>
<P>
   I know you are quite tied up with that Kosovo stuff, but I also
know you have the best interests of American citizens at heart and
would want to be informed about this.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Americans are being kidnapped daily in foreign
cities, notably in the Mediterranean rim.
</P>
<P>
   As you typically post warnings to Americans about traveling to
places such as North Korea, Libya, Iran and, now, the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, you might consider a foreboding about these
kidnappings, temporary as they are and, thankfully, with no
fatalities to date.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, these kidnappings are not at the hands of terrorists
but they are of note nevertheless. In the last three weeks, I was
kidnapped in Mallorca, Marrakech and Tunis. Last year, I was
kidnapped in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Please do not attach any political patterns to this, it's all
got to do with the Big Hustle. As American tourists travel to
foreign destinations they most likely will buy what is called a
tour. Part of that package usually is the half-day tour of a
principal city, and that's where the kidnapping takes place.
</P>
<P>
   The tour guide, often operating under the pretense of being a
college professor with a specialty in archaeology or religion,
typically has a brother-in-law who sells carpets.
</P>
<P>
   As you exit an historic site and your gasping, mostly aging,
group trails the guide through the winding narrow streets of souks,
bazaars, casbahs or medinas, you suddenly are bewilderingly herded
into a carpet-laden establishment and made to climb one or two
flights of steps into a large room with rolls of carpeting stacked
on end. There, a cadre of swarmy-looking persons stand by, awaiting
the moment they are turned loose on you.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you have been through this before, you have no idea of
what is about to happen. You are made to sit on benches along the
outside perimeter of the room while an English-speaking person asks
if you would prefer mint tea or Coke. (I ask you, what would you
rather drink: a narrow glass of clear liquid with a huge leaf of
something in it, or a Coca-Cola?)
</P>
<P>
   As you squirm uncomfortably on your bench, usually drinking
whatever that mint tea is because you feel if you order a Coke, you
will be seen as an ugly American, the prime salesman is telling you
how many knots are woven into the carpet as the others begin
rolling out the various samples.
</P>
<P>
   It is there and then that you realize you have been had and the
Big Hustle is on. You look for an exit but it is blocked by
salesmen. When the presentation is completed, you are further held
against your will by those same people who now try to isolate you
into small groups, asking which carpet you want to purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes ago, I was looking at some breathtaking Arabic
architecture, totally unaware that in a short time I was going to
be forced down a narrow alley, up several flights of stairs and
waylaid by carpet salesmen every bit the equal of used car
salesmen, if not better.
</P>
<P>
   The inexperienced, those who never have been kidnapped before,
make the mistake of asking a question about the carpet _ something
like, ``What's it look like on the back?'' -- and it's like
bleeding just ahead of a shark.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us, freed by our own resilience, have squirmed away
from the room only to be beset upon by shawl, fez, religious object
and stuffed camel salesmen on the lower floor while we await the
release of our besieged friends above.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three or four-hour whirlwind of the city, more than an
hour of it is taken by this involuntary visit to the carpet shop.
(In other places, it might be the pearl or cameo factory or the
diamond cutters.)
</P>
<P>
   I thought you people in State ought to know about it. The next
time I am kidnapped in such a manner, and after I am released, I
would like you guys to tell the Pentagon to bomb the place. But,
please, just the carpet place.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Poor Al Gore. As if President Clinton's keening
that his loyal No. 2 needs to unbend were not enough, now the
Republicans have made Gore a punch line.
</P>
<P>
   Even Steve Forbes, a Republican presidential candidate not known
for flair, gets big laughs cracking wise about Gore's lack of
flair. ``Concerning Gore, I won't be giving him any advice today,''
Forbes deadpanned last week. ``He seems to be getting enough from
the White House.'' He then referred to the vice president's ``rigor
mortis.'' Both lines drew more cheers than anything Forbes said
about his new Social Security proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon used to advise his proteges not to worry if they
were loved or despised. ``The worst sin in politics,'' he once
said, ``is being boring.''
</P>
<P>
   From money to the entire White House infrastructure to
on-the-job experience, Gore has more advantages than any candidate
for president today. Yet polls show that his support in the
primaries is less than enthusiastic, and that he would get
clobbered in a general election by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas or
Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The vice president is boring. The American people, in
polls, say so. Leno and Letterman say so. Even his mentor, Clinton,
says so. Gore tried to turn his weakness into a strength, by making
self-deprecating jokes, but the boring schtick was boring.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's fate will depend on a question that is as yet
unanswerable. After the vertiginous, long-running Clinton sitcom,
will Americans want more presidential high jinks? Or will they want
a respite from it all? Will voters want a leader focusing intensely
on them, or will they just want to be left alone to play the stock
market? No one, after all, is more gratifyingly boring than Alan
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Podesta, a Democratic strategist, said that after sampling
years with Clinton, voters may want calm. ``People go to amusement
parks and like roller coasters,'' he said. ``At the same time, they
appreciate the straight and narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   If America wants bland, Al Gore is the man. Many of the hottest
politicians these days are the coldest. The appropriately named
Gray Davis chastised reporters last year for wanting a candidate
``who could be a replacement for Jay Leno.'' Three months later,
Davis, a Democrat, was elected governor of California. Now he calls
himself Gore's ``charisma adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, the determinedly dull governor of New York,
George Pataki, who invites critics to compare him with his
predecessor, Mario Cuomo, the compelling Democratic orator.
``There's a big difference between glitz and substance and rhetoric
and reality,'' Pataki said. ``If you look at my predecessor, there
was nobody who was better able to give a speech. But he was not as
able to change a government.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's friends still respond, perhaps reflexively, to queries
about the very vertical vice president with a query of their own:
``When were you last out with him? He's changed.'' They insist that
the dullness quotient is way overstated. They say Gore can be
surprisingly engaging, even robust, in small settings when the
cameras aren't around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't Al Gore's people understand?'' asked Mandy Grunwald,
a media consultant who is advising Hillary Rodham Clinton.
``Instead of bemoaning the fact that he's not Clinton, celebrate
it. People want the substance of the Clinton-Gore years without the
soap opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Gore's advisers are beginning to agree. ``Boring is good
because it means reliable,'' said Marla Romash, a Gore adviser who
for years has defended Gore's campaign skills. ``It means someone
who's going to get the job done. It means someone who's going to
stay focused.'' Gore's advisers argue that he has been so
overshadowed by the president that people have not had a chance to
get to know him.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, blandness comes in as many flavors as Ben &AMP; Jerry's.
In Gore's case, it means a candidate who is uninspiring and
sometimes awkward with voters (a telltale sign _ he doesn't know
quite what to do with a baby.) His lone rival, former Sen. Bill
Bradley, has some provocative ideas, but can be prone to deliver
them in a lifeless monotone. He almost seems to dislike
interruptions for applause.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the mix of fizz and bland policies is a winning
combination. One explanation for why Bush is the early favorite for
the Republican nomination may be that he knows how to charm voters.
(A recent Washington Post/ABC News Poll found 56 percent of voters
viewed Gore as somewhat or very boring; only 23 percent said that
of Bush.) But on policy matters, Bush has tried to sit on his lead
and appeal to the widest electorate possible by being
nonprovocative.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, despite Clinton's piquant reputation, some of his
best points came when he tried to make politics and ideology as
bland as possible, as when he pressed for school uniforms in the
1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to say to me _ I'm not sure to my face _ that I
was kind of dull,'' said Michael Dukakis, the Democratic
presidential nominee in 1988 and three-term governor of
Massachusetts, who sympathizes with Gore. ``I would say, `You don't
get re-elected three times because you're dull.'''
</P>
<P>
   Noting the extraordinary oratorical skills of Presidents Reagan
and Clinton, he added, ``If you're going to judge the rest of us by
these two guys, then we'll all be in sad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes blandness comes in cycles. In New York, voters picked
the peppery Ed Koch as mayor. Then they opted for David Dinkins
(bland) and then Rudolph Giuliani (highly spiced).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rise of politicians like Pataki and Davis, there
still is some appetite for sizzle. In the contest for Minnesota
governor last year, the professional wrestler Jesse ``the Body''
Ventura defeated Hubert Humphrey III who, unlike his father, is
hardly a live wire.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over personality is important because voters often
look to politicians, specifically presidents, to inspire and to
lead. This is the television age, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straightforward is OK but boring is never in,'' said Patrick
Caddell, a pollster for President Jimmy Carter. ``We're talking
about the presidency. They don't want Bill Clinton back, this wild,
out-of-control thing. But to say if you're a wooden Indian that's
OK, that's overstating it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in Austin, Texas, Bush, who has the
raffish charm of Bill Clinton, declined to discuss Gore's political
skills. Yet he made the case for a president who connects with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to know you care,'' he said. ``People want to know
you relate. People want to see you in action. That's really
important, particularly in early states where retail politics can
affect the outcome of the election. People know if you're
uncomfortable around them. People know if you don't like them.
People are smart.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even if Gore buys the idea that bland is beautiful, he should
not expect it to carry him to the White House. Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., who was considered so bland that he was passed over for Dan
Quayle as George Bush's running mate in 1988, tried to turn his
seriousness into an asset in the 1996 presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his commercials, Lugar spoke earnestly as a photograph
of Clinton, Gore and Jim Belushi, in sunglasses and fedoras,
mugging as the Blues Brothers, flashed on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidency is serious business,'' Lugar said, very
seriously. ``The president is not entertainment. The president is
commander in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters, however, did not take Lugar seriously at all. He was
soon out of the race, saying he had no interest in ``competing
endlessly with no prospects.''

 &HT;    Security First raises Atlanta's financial profile
 &HT;    By Ernie Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was, back in the 1970s, Atlanta was the banking capital of
the Southeast, partly by virtue of Mills B. Lane, the legendary
chairman of Citizens and Southern Bank. The bank, later best known
as C&AMP;S, was a powerhouse that fueled much of the economic
development, and Lane's progressive style helped to set the tone
for what we called the New South.
</P>
<P>
   Happenstance, some elements of history and other factors have
shifted the mantle of financial leadership away from Atlanta,
mostly toward Charlotte _ even though Atlanta remains the leader in
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   We were reminded recently that quietly but surely Atlanta is
regaining some financial distinction. This time it's in the new
realm of electronic communication and the new public appetite for
banking at home, or from the desk at the office, or rapid
transactions between companies.
</P>
<P>
   Security First Technologies, a name that does not trip off the
tongue like NationsBank or SunTrust, announced a $1.4 billion deal
last week that could solidify the company's position as an
important supplier of software and technology that helps banks
extend electronic service to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Both residential and commercial customers benefit from the
programs, fueling the gradual tilt toward banking by computer
rather than the traditional ways. From all appearances, it is the
wave of the future in the world of finance.
</P>
<P>
   Security First, subject to approval by all concerned, has moved
to buy competitors FICS and Edify. The company is adopting the name
S1. Furthermore, Intuit is purchasing a 2.5 percent stake in S1 for
$50 million, enabling both companies to deploy Intuit's commercial
systems for tax filing, as well as handling payroll and tax
payments.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it a big deal is not the dollar figure of $1.4
billion, though even today that is certainly substantial. What is
big is that, in the words of Security First Chief Executive Officer
James S. Mahan III, the deal ``rounds out our product offering and
takes our strongest competitor out of the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you want to do electronic transactions, very
soon the chances will be that S1 might be the supplier of the
technology that makes it happen. Who knows _ banks may soon carry a
seal on the window, ``S1 Inside.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Security First is making itself a fundamental force
in the world of electronic finance much as Microsoft did in the
world of computers. Microsoft chose to master the operating systems
of computers and left the vicissitudes of the marketplace to the
computer hardware developers like Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and
others. It turned out to be a good choice.
</P>
<P>
   In somewhat the same way, Security First is supplying the muscle
to electronic banking and leaving the shape and presentation,
marketing and capitalization of the services to the style of the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   S1 is not dominant. In fact it competes against a giant called
CheckFree Holdings, as well as smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   But it has increased its power and reach, and according to some
analysts, now becomes more of a competitive force overseas.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this a true Atlanta story is that the basic
underlying technology that launched Security First as we know it
was developed in the early 1980s by SecureWare, a company spawned
by the Georgia Tech incubator program.
</P>
<P>
   It is that technology that is really driving the growing
business now enjoyed by S1 and its big customers, which include a
dozen major banks.

   Hill to be on time to push Northern Arc
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Hill vows he'll be on time for the big Northern Arc
showdown this week. The chairman of the Gwinnett County and the
Atlanta Regional commissions got stuck in traffic earlier this
month when a planning committee debated a blueprint for the
region's future and decided to try to kill the Northern Arc.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the transportation plan goes before the full ARC board
and Hill, an ardent Northern Arc supporter, says he'll be there for
the lobbying, as well as the voting. The board is set to select a
group of projects that its staff will test for air quality over the
next several months with the aim of adopting a final transportation
plan in March.
</P>
<P>
   Success will mean metro Atlanta is in compliance with federal
air pollution limits and road building can commence. Hill says the
new Georgia Regional Transportation Authority is likely to build
the 59-mile arc across the northern suburbs even if it's left out
of the ARC plan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce,
members say the Northern Arc and the whole transportation plan
ought to be shelved until the kinks are worked out. In a letter
sent to the ARC last week, chamber members complain the current
plan anticipates spending lots of money on transportation fixes
over the next 25 years with little hope for improved mobility in
the region. Better to delay the vote and create a plan that at
least forecasts an improvement, the letter says.
</P>
<P>
   The business group wants specific proposals, such as the
Northern Arc, taken out of the group of projects that will be put
through the air quality test. And it wants the ARC to come up with
a comprehensive and cost-effective transportation system for the
region before adopting a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Contested roads continue to grow
</P>
<P>
   While the lawyers negotiate, the asphalt keeps spreading,
bringing 11 contested roads in eight metro Atlanta counties closer
to completion. Environmentalists and road builders are extending
until June 21 a deadline to settle a lawsuit over roads that were
grandfathered through what government officials hope are loopholes
in the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Environmental Law Center, on behalf of
environmental groups, is targeting 11 roads in progress in an
effort to coerce governments to spend more money on alternative
transportation such as rail lines, bike paths and sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   It's $140 million worth of projects, including the widening of
Peachtree Industrial Boulevard in Gwinnett and a new 6-mile road in
south Fulton County.
</P>
<P>
   $50 oversight sends Air Touch to court
</P>
<P>
   For want of $50, Air Touch Cellular is having to make a federal
case out of a proposed cell tower in Forsyth County. In 1998 the
company applied to the county for a tower along Ga. 400 to meet
growing demand in the corridor, sending in its $200 fee. Problem:
The fee was $250. According to Air Touch's recent U.S. District
Court lawsuit, a county staffer said not to worry, simply pay the
$50 when picking up the permit. Problem: The county declared a
moratorium in February before Air Touch picked up the permit. Last
month the county sent Air Touch a check for the $200, with an
explanation that the fee was insufficient and the site needed
rezoning, which wouldn't happen during the moratorium. The county
has until next month to respond to the cellular company's charges.

   Even if Gore buys the idea that bland is beautiful, he should
not expect it to carry him to the White House. Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., who was considered so bland that he was passed over for Dan
Quayle as George Bush's running mate in 1988, tried to turn his
seriousness into an asset in the 1996 presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his commercials, Lugar spoke earnestly as a photograph
of Clinton, Gore and Jim Belushi, in sunglasses and fedoras,
mugging as the Blues Brothers, flashed on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidency is serious business,'' Lugar said, very
seriously. ``The president is not entertainment. The president is
commander in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters, however, did not take Lugar seriously at all. He was
soon out of the race, saying he had no interest in ``competing
endlessly with no prospects.''

 &HT;    Tech's market model signals `sell'
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Serrvice
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market model at Georgia Tech recently registered a
``sell'' signal.
</P>
<P>
   That alone would be something to think about. It becomes even
more thinkable when you consider that it's only the fourth sell
signal from that model in more than a decade, and the previous
three were in 1994, 1990 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Just to refresh your memory, 1994 was a turbulent year of rising
interest rates. Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.5 percent
for the year, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained only 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 fell 6.6 percent in 1990 due to a Saddam
Hussein-inspired stock sell-off that everybody agrees was a ``bear
market.'' The Dow fell 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And who needs to be reminded of 1987, the year of the greatest
crash in stock market history?
</P>
<P>
   Why does the stock market model register sell again?
</P>
<P>
   Because bond yields are high, explains Fred C. Allvine.
</P>
<P>
   Allvine is the ubiquitous Georgia Tech professor who is also
director of Tech's Stock Market Project, monitor of the market.
</P>
<P>
   A reading of 50 on Tech's zero-to-100 model is a ``buy'' signal,
and a reading of 20 is a ``sell.'' At the moment, says Allvine, the
model stands at 11.6.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't the model signal a sell last summer, when stock
prices were clearly headed for the cellar?
</P>
<P>
   Before that correction was over, the market had tanked in its
worst sell-off since 1990. The Dow fell from 9,338 on July 17 to
7,539 on Aug. 31, or just over 19 percent (other indexes declined
further).
</P>
<P>
   But there was no sell signal because bond yields also fell.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury yield dropped from 5.92 percent on May 14
to 4.71 on Oct. 5, or 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the correction, the stock market has rallied
vigorously _ astonishingly might be a better term.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow is up about 3,500 points since early October to its
recent high of 11,108, or almost 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the 30-year Treasury yield has also moved higher, from 4.84
percent in October to a recent high of 5.92 _ a gain of 25.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Explanations for the rising bond yields vary, but the basic idea
is that bond traders are increasingly worried about inflation.
That, in turn, would lead to higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel rise in stock prices and bond yields is similar to
earlier situations when the stock market model signaled a sell.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists are concerned that the rise in bond yields at a time
when stocks are under pressure could lead to the next stock market
correction. Rising yields make bonds highly attractive to investors
as an alternative to stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A scary event is all it would take to trigger such a sell-off,
according to this thesis.
</P>
<P>
   Bearish analysts contend that stocks are under pressure largely
because of their high valuations as measured by price-to-earnings
and other ratios.
</P>
<P>
   Stock market bulls argue, however, that the market really isn't
overpriced, when you consider how low inflation is.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the Federal Reserve to suggest that inflation could
become a problem again. And Fed members said last week they
``lean'' toward an interest rate increase to ward off inflation _ a
sentiment that could keep bond yields from falling very far.
</P>
<P>
   It may be getting difficult for an individual investor to decide
what to do as Wall Street's big names debate the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Allvine has a suggestion. ``The market may go up from here,'' he
said, ``but the prudent investor should be cautious.''

 &HT;    FEAR OF Y2K A BOON FOR MAKERS OF WINDMILLS
 &HT;    1100&AMP;adds. Moving in (a) national and (l) lifestyle categories
for release Sunday, June 6.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINFIELD, Ala. _ Dusk was still several hours away as Ken
O'Brock tightened the final screws on the windmill he had
constructed on a sweltering spring day in a rolling pasture about
75 miles northwest of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   If he hustled, O'Brock figured, he could load his equipment onto
the truck with the Ohio WINDMIL license plates and get a good start
on the long drive to his next job in central Florida. As the final
months of the millennium tick down, time is precious for a veteran
windmiller with more business than he can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing twice as many jobs this year,'' said the owner and
installer of O'Brock Windmills of North Benton, Ohio. ``In one
week, I put up four windmills. One near Athens, Ga. One outside of
Bainbridge, Ga. And two in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Why this surprising surge in a centuries-old technology? Credit
a more modern technological glitch _ the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   Folks are afraid that many computers may shut down at midnight
on Dec. 31, when programs that use only two digits to record dates
won't be able to distinguish the new year 2000 from 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Livestock and crops _ not to mention people _ will get thirsty
awfully fast if the Y2K bug stings computers at power plants, and
electric pumps stop sending water to homes and farms.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, my friend, is ...
</P>
<P>
   Demand for windmills has been ``incredible,'' said Craig Donges,
owner of Ohio Windmills, near Youngstown. ``There's a big concern
for drinking water come the new millennium. My sales have probably
doubled this year. There's been a lot of interest in the Southeast.
Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas have probably been my biggest new
customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuben Neely, a retired elementary school principal, hired
O'Brock to erect a 47-foot windmill on his farm outside Bainbridge,
in southwestern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not strictly because of Y2K,'' Neely said. ``But I
believe in being prepared. If anything happens, I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Windmills were already in use the last time a new millennium
blew in. ``The earliest reference to a windmill occurs in the works
of Arab writers in the 9th Century AD,'' according to the
Encyclopedia Britannica. Windmills spread through Europe between
the 12th and early 19th Centuries until wind power began to be
replaced, initially by steam power and later the
internal-combustion engine and electric power.
</P>
<P>
   Windmills were at least as important as the six-shooter in
settling the American West. Indeed, they were widely used until the
1930s, when New Deal programs began wiring rural America for
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1854, Daniel Halladay introduced a wind-powered pump in the
United States that is basically the design still used today. A
number of blades are set radially on a wheel, like spokes. The wide
blades are curved and angled to catch even a slight breeze. A tail
vane keeps the wheel facing the wind. The turning wheel provides
power to move a long shaft up and down to pump water from a well.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a five- to seven-mile-per-hour wind'' to turn the
blades enough to power the pump, said O'Brock.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, windmills _ which cost $5,000 and up _ aren't the
only low-tech solutions to a possible millennium meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a tremendous upsurge in demand for hand pumps,''
said David Suey, president of Dempster Industries of Beatrice, Neb.
``We got caught off guard. Didn't know what was happening at first.
Everyone ordering hand pumps. Then a customer mentioned Y2K and it
came to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The hand pumps are priced at about $500 apiece, and the company
usually sells hundreds a year, mostly to Third World customers.
This year, sales are already in the thousands, mostly to domestic
dealers ``in every single state,'' said Suey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come the end of December, we'd better not have more than a
nickel's worth of inventory,'' he said. ``Unless these guys
(predicting Y2K disaster) are the smart ones. Then everyone else
will be wanting a pump.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales are also booming for wood-burning stoves, kerosene
lanterns, food canners and juicers, water filters and all sorts of
other survivalist gear, said Glenda Lehman Ervin, communications
manager of Lehman's in Kidron, Ohio. From its sprawling Midwestern
store and through its globally distributed catalog, Lehman's has
been selling non-electric appliances since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of the founder, Ervin said Lehman's traditional
customers are the Amish, missionaries, homesteaders,
environmentalists and the ``chronically nostalgic'' who savor
old-fashioned items like hand-cranked ice cream churns. This year,
she said, the normal business has been ``overwhelmed'' by
``Y2Kers.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Lehman's has taken pride in providing ``same-day
service _ shipping the same day we received an order,'' she said.
``We're now four to five weeks behind (on some items). Our pipeline
is choked. We're not set up for this volume of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the boom has been a mixed blessing for a company with a
motto of ``more than a store, it's a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want business based on fears of what may or may not
happen'' on New Year's Day, said Ervin. ``We're in this for the
long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   So is O'Brock, an amiable 59-year-old former farmer who has been
selling and erecting windmills since 1968. With his wife, Sharen,
often serving as his ground crew, O'Brock estimates he has set up
500 to 800 windmills, at least one in every state, including Alaska
and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a handful of independent windmillers like O'Brock
and Donges and Paul Crowley of Ropesville, Texas, who travel around
the country setting up windmills for individual farmers, ranchers
and homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The windmill community is divided into two segments, explained
Randall Swisher, director of the American Wind Energy Association,
a national trade group.
</P>
<P>
   One segment is the commercial energy industry that utilizes huge
``wind farms'' with hundreds of windmills and turbines to generate
electricity for businesses or even communities. The other segment
consists of folks who have a windmill in their backyard to pump
water or to power a small generator, or have several windmills
scattered across a ranch to pump water for cattle on isolated
ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Swisher estimated that there are 30,000 or so of these
individually owned windmills in operation. But the number is
growing rapidly as 1999 breezes toward 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in business since 1888 (and will) set sales records
this year,'' said James Dockel, sales manager for the Aeromotor
Windmill Corp. in San Angelo, Texas. The company manufactures
windmills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first three months were my best year ever,'' said Ellen
Sattler of American Windmills in Diamond Springs, Calif. ``We sell
to people who put it up as a kit. A giant Erector set, I call it.
With the help of a few buddies, a few beers and pizzas, it takes a
couple of days for somebody who is a little bit mechanical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are strictly water pumpers,'' she said. Her customers
are ``normally farmers, but not this year. Now it's Joe
Americana.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Or it's Cyndy Wright, who hired O'Brock to build a windmill in a
pasture on her spread outside Winfield in the hills northwestern
Alabama. An anesthetist at the local hospital and something of a
rural maverick, Wright raises longhorn steers and horses in a
region known more for corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted a windmill. Now I've got one,'' she declared
as O'Brock climbed down from the 40-foot tower after spinning the
wheel, which measured eight feet across, and drawing water on a
windless afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K issue didn't figure in her decision to build the
windmill, she said, ``but it would be nice to be a little
self-sufficient in case something happened.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by Pat Halloran, who has a new O'Brock
windmill on his Stone Oak Farm in Oglethorpe County, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted a windmill all my life,'' he said. Rotating atop a
53-foot tower, his windmill provides water to ``trickle irrigate''
a big garden of corn, tomatoes, herbs and other produce.
</P>
<P>
   There is often a good dose of romance and nostalgia mingled in
with the practicality of having a windmill, O'Brock believes. ``Y2K
has provided a good excuse for a lot of people who always wanted a
windmill.''
</P>
<P>
   He includes himself among these windmill lovers. ``I had an old
windmill on my farm and I thought it would be neat to fix it up,''
he said. That was in 1967. He rebuilt his own windmill and has been
building them for others ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times people want to put one up just to look at it,''
said Crowley, of Paul's Windmills in Ropesville, Texas. His shop is
not far from the windmill collection and museum in Lubbock, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   A retired school teacher, Crowley put one up for himself and
``the next thing I knew, I was selling them.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a windmill depends on how deep the well must be and
how tall the tower must be. O'Brock said the tower should be 15
feet taller than any trees or structures within 400 feet. However,
there are exceptions. In Cyndy Wright's pasture, the tower was no
taller than two nearby trees, but the prevailing winds came from
other directions.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brock said he has never fallen from a windmill tower, but came
close once. He had already unfastened his safety belt when a gust
of wind swung the wheel around and knocked him off the platform. A
hook on the unfastened safety belt caught on a tower brace and
saved him.
</P>
<P>
   Every windmill presents a new challenge, he said. And since many
are erected on isolated farms, he often stays with his customers,
making friends while finishing his task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never intend to retire,'' he hollers down from the top of
the tower. ``I like what I'm doing.''
</P>

   LONDON _ What was a British prime minister doing dressed down in
an open-neck shirt and short sleeves and sitting cross-legged and
shoeless in a refugee tent in Albania? And why was this leader of a
spent imperial power passing as much time this month in places like
Aachen, Bonn, Brussels, Bucharest, Chicago, Mons, Sofia, Skopje,
Tirana and Washington as in London?
</P>
<P>
   Through a combination of passion, stamina and focus, Prime
Minister Tony Blair has turned his look of concern into NATO's most
familiar face, and his sermonizing speech into the alliance's most
insistent voice, articulating in emotive language a moral
justification for the conflict over Kosovo and a demand for an
uncompromising solution to it.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he is projecting a belligerent British view
across the English Channel onto a continent that Britain has long
treated warily, and across the Atlantic to a continent that it is
used to addressing more modestly.
</P>
<P>
   So far Blair's aggressiveness enjoys considerable support in
Britain, but it has provoked some strong opinions abroad. Most
notably, his lobbying last week for an augmented ground force that
would be prepared to enter Kosovo before any peace settlement
brought annoyed retorts from two allied leaders.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton told the prime minister during a 90-minute
trans-Atlantic phone call that Britain was fostering a dangerous
appearance of disunity between London and Washington, and Gerhard
Schroeder, the German chancellor, said flatly that Germany was
against the introduction of ground forces and would veto it in
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder added a line that left no doubt who he thought was out
of line: he described the alliance's disagreement as ``this
specifically British debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Blair's combative campaign a case of the old British Lion
getting its lusty roar back? Or does it reflect a wholly new
British assertiveness, from a self-described young modernizer
interested now in remodeling Britain's global role in the
attention-getting way that he has been reshaping its politics at
home? Or is it a bit of both, the old noble beast turned out in
eye-catching trappings from New Labor stylists?
</P>
<P>
   To Kenneth Minogue, professor emeritus of government at the
London School of Economics, Blair's campaign represents ``a
remarkably high level of personal diplomacy for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Diana syndrome,'' he continued, ``a policy made by
image, the image of miserable refugees, not one made in terms of
long years of development.'' He said the 46-year-old leader's
tactics had put the British into ``a position of having to put up
or shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problem is we can't put up, and we won't shut up,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   John Keegan, the military historian, said he thought Blair's
populist brand of politics was no way to fight a war. ``Master
politician that he is,'' he said, ``he has no experience of
conducting the diplomatic or military side of war. He is running
terrible risks. Polls show that he has a majority of public
support, but it is the support of tabloid readers. The
well-informed feel uninformed, are anxious and racked by doubt.
Those who cheer him on do so in the spirit of football
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony King, professor of government at the University of
Essex, sees Blair's current conduct as squarely in the British
tradition. ``Certainly Churchill during World War II made it a very
personal affair and went in for great personal symbolism,'' he
said. ``He was much given to posing with a tommy gun and a bowler
hat, he went to bomb sites, walked the decks of warships. I've no
idea whether Blair has that analogy in mind, but I think he's just
doing what comes naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Blair trying to muscle his friend Bill Clinton, ``British
prime ministers have been in the business of trying to influence
American presidents for a large part of this century,'' King said.
``Churchill regarded wooing and winning over Franklin Roosevelt as
a prime mission of his life, Attlee was always busy with Truman,
and Thatcher made it her business to work on both Reagan and
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's repeated calls for total victory (``no compromise, no
fudge, no half-baked deals''), his reliance on graphic accounts of
refugee miseries and his description of the war as a ``just'' one
based on moral principles have resonances in British political
history for Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at Oxford
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladstone talked of Bulgarian horrors and Turkish atrocities
in the late 1870s, and it's in the British tradition of the liberal
left to believe that one intervenes to define certain values,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Its proven military capability and willingness to use it has
always given Britain international influence, and Blair has
exploited the current NATO mission to emphasize his desire to
repair relations with the continent after the years of
Conservative-sponsored estrangement. In Aachen, Germany, this
month, he said he insisted that Britain resolve ``once and for all
its ambivalence towards Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to end the uncertainty, the lack of confidence, the
Europhobia,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's present popularity at home remains the highest of any
prime minister in British history, and the Conservative opposition
is fractured and ineffectual. Debate on Britain's war policy filled
little more than half the seats in the House of Commons last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the risk of sounding naive,'' said King, ``one thing to
bear in mind is that Blair is a creature of calculation, but also a
creature of instinct. His sense of outrage at what the Serbs are
doing is both profound and completely genuine. I don't think he's
grandstanding, and he's a proven risk taker, led to his convictions
by his gut and his passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the failure of his view to prevail may not pose that high a
risk for him. If NATO settles for less than its declared
objectives, Blair will not be the one faulted. Prompted by winks
and hints from 10 Downing St., British public opinion and the
British press have already laid the charge of going for an
indecisive conclusion at the door of Clinton, and that is where it
will continue to reside.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Marr, a columnist for The Observer, wrote last week that
Blair's role as the aggressive young war leader at first struck him
as ``a crazy gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that even as NATO bombing mistakes mount and the
war's aims seem more remote, he found himself moving toward a
different conclusion. ``Every political instinct I have,'' Marr
wrote, ``tells me that Blair is going to emerge from this war with
Kosovo back in NATO hands and a position of European leadership no
British leader has enjoyed since 1945.''

 &HT;    FEAR OF Y2K A BOON FOR MAKERS OF WINDMILLS
 &HT;    1100&AMP;adds. Moving in (a) national and (l) lifestyle categories
for release Sunday, June 6.
 &HT;    By BOB DART

<P>
   WINFIELD, Ala. _ Dusk was still several hours away as Ken
O'Brock tightened the final screws on the windmill he had
constructed on a sweltering spring day in a rolling pasture about
75 miles northwest of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   If he hustled, O'Brock figured, he could load his equipment onto
the truck with the Ohio WINDMIL license plates and get a good start
on the long drive to his next job in central Florida. As the final
months of the millennium tick down, time is precious for a veteran
windmiller with more business than he can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing twice as many jobs this year,'' said the owner and
installer of O'Brock Windmills of North Benton, Ohio. ``In one
week, I put up four windmills. One near Athens, Ga. One outside of
Bainbridge, Ga. And two in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Why this surprising surge in a centuries-old technology? Credit
a more modern technological glitch _ the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   Folks are afraid that many computers may shut down at midnight
on Dec. 31, when programs that use only two digits to record dates
won't be able to distinguish the new year 2000 from 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Livestock and crops _ not to mention people _ will get thirsty
awfully fast if the Y2K bug stings computers at power plants, and
electric pumps stop sending water to homes and farms.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, my friend, is ...
</P>
<P>
   Demand for windmills has been ``incredible,'' said Craig Donges,
owner of Ohio Windmills, near Youngstown. ``There's a big concern
for drinking water come the new millennium. My sales have probably
doubled this year. There's been a lot of interest in the Southeast.
Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas have probably been my biggest new
customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuben Neely, a retired elementary school principal, hired
O'Brock to erect a 47-foot windmill on his farm outside Bainbridge,
in southwestern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not strictly because of Y2K,'' Neely said. ``But I
believe in being prepared. If anything happens, I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Windmills were already in use the last time a new millennium
blew in. ``The earliest reference to a windmill occurs in the works
of Arab writers in the 9th Century AD,'' according to the
Encyclopedia Britannica. Windmills spread through Europe between
the 12th and early 19th Centuries until wind power began to be
replaced, initially by steam power and later the
internal-combustion engine and electric power.
</P>
<P>
   Windmills were at least as important as the six-shooter in
settling the American West. Indeed, they were widely used until the
1930s, when New Deal programs began wiring rural America for
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1854, Daniel Halladay introduced a wind-powered pump in the
United States that is basically the design still used today. A
number of blades are set radially on a wheel, like spokes. The wide
blades are curved and angled to catch even a slight breeze. A tail
vane keeps the wheel facing the wind. The turning wheel provides
power to move a long shaft up and down to pump water from a well.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a five- to seven-mile-per-hour wind'' to turn the
blades enough to power the pump, said O'Brock.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, windmills _ which cost $5,000 and up _ aren't the
only low-tech solutions to a possible millennium meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a tremendous upsurge in demand for hand pumps,''
said David Suey, president of Dempster Industries of Beatrice, Neb.
``We got caught off guard. Didn't know what was happening at first.
Everyone ordering hand pumps. Then a customer mentioned Y2K and it
came to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The hand pumps are priced at about $500 apiece, and the company
usually sells hundreds a year, mostly to Third World customers.
This year, sales are already in the thousands, mostly to domestic
dealers ``in every single state,'' said Suey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come the end of December, we'd better not have more than a
nickel's worth of inventory,'' he said. ``Unless these guys
(predicting Y2K disaster) are the smart ones. Then everyone else
will be wanting a pump.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales are also booming for wood-burning stoves, kerosene
lanterns, food canners and juicers, water filters and all sorts of
other survivalist gear, said Glenda Lehman Ervin, communications
manager of Lehman's in Kidron, Ohio. From its sprawling Midwestern
store and through its globally distributed catalog, Lehman's has
been selling non-electric appliances since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of the founder, Ervin said Lehman's traditional
customers are the Amish, missionaries, homesteaders,
environmentalists and the ``chronically nostalgic'' who savor
old-fashioned items like hand-cranked ice cream churns. This year,
she said, the normal business has been ``overwhelmed'' by
``Y2Kers.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Lehman's has taken pride in providing ``same-day
service _ shipping the same day we received an order,'' she said.
``We're now four to five weeks behind (on some items). Our pipeline
is choked. We're not set up for this volume of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the boom has been a mixed blessing for a company with a
motto of ``more than a store, it's a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want business based on fears of what may or may not
happen'' on New Year's Day, said Ervin. ``We're in this for the
long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   So is O'Brock, an amiable 59-year-old former farmer who has been
selling and erecting windmills since 1968. With his wife, Sharen,
often serving as his ground crew, O'Brock estimates he has set up
500 to 800 windmills, at least one in every state, including Alaska
and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a handful of independent windmillers like O'Brock
and Donges and Paul Crowley of Ropesville, Texas, who travel around
the country setting up windmills for individual farmers, ranchers
and homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The windmill community is divided into two segments, explained
Randall Swisher, director of the American Wind Energy Association,
a national trade group.
</P>
<P>
   One segment is the commercial energy industry that utilizes huge
``wind farms'' with hundreds of windmills and turbines to generate
electricity for businesses or even communities. The other segment
consists of folks who have a windmill in their backyard to pump
water or to power a small generator, or have several windmills
scattered across a ranch to pump water for cattle on isolated
ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Swisher estimated that there are 30,000 or so of these
individually owned windmills in operation. But the number is
growing rapidly as 1999 breezes toward 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in business since 1888 (and will) set sales records
this year,'' said James Dockel, sales manager for the Aeromotor
Windmill Corp. in San Angelo, Texas. The company manufactures
windmills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first three months were my best year ever,'' said Ellen
Sattler of American Windmills in Diamond Springs, Calif. ``We sell
to people who put it up as a kit. A giant Erector set, I call it.
With the help of a few buddies, a few beers and pizzas, it takes a
couple of days for somebody who is a little bit mechanical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are strictly water pumpers,'' she said. Her customers
are ``normally farmers, but not this year. Now it's Joe
Americana.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Or it's Cyndy Wright, who hired O'Brock to build a windmill in a
pasture on her spread outside Winfield in the hills northwestern
Alabama. An anesthetist at the local hospital and something of a
rural maverick, Wright raises longhorn steers and horses in a
region known more for corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted a windmill. Now I've got one,'' she declared
as O'Brock climbed down from the 40-foot tower after spinning the
wheel, which measured eight feet across, and drawing water on a
windless afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K issue didn't figure in her decision to build the
windmill, she said, ``but it would be nice to be a little
self-sufficient in case something happened.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by Pat Halloran, who has a new O'Brock
windmill on his Stone Oak Farm in Oglethorpe County, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted a windmill all my life,'' he said. Rotating atop a
53-foot tower, his windmill provides water to ``trickle irrigate''
a big garden of corn, tomatoes, herbs and other produce.
</P>
<P>
   There is often a good dose of romance and nostalgia mingled in
with the practicality of having a windmill, O'Brock believes. ``Y2K
has provided a good excuse for a lot of people who always wanted a
windmill.''
</P>
<P>
   He includes himself among these windmill lovers. ``I had an old
windmill on my farm and I thought it would be neat to fix it up,''
he said. That was in 1967. He rebuilt his own windmill and has been
building them for others ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times people want to put one up just to look at it,''
said Crowley, of Paul's Windmills in Ropesville, Texas. His shop is
not far from the windmill collection and museum in Lubbock, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   A retired school teacher, Crowley put one up for himself and
``the next thing I knew, I was selling them.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a windmill depends on how deep the well must be and
how tall the tower must be. O'Brock said the tower should be 15
feet taller than any trees or structures within 400 feet. However,
there are exceptions. In Cyndy Wright's pasture, the tower was no
taller than two nearby trees, but the prevailing winds came from
other directions.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brock said he has never fallen from a windmill tower, but came
close once. He had already unfastened his safety belt when a gust
of wind swung the wheel around and knocked him off the platform. A
hook on the unfastened safety belt caught on a tower brace and
saved him.
</P>
<P>
   Every windmill presents a new challenge, he said. And since many
are erected on isolated farms, he often stays with his customers,
making friends while finishing his task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never intend to retire,'' he hollers down from the top of
the tower. ``I like what I'm doing.''

 &HT;    KASICH FOLLOWING HIS HEART, MAYBE TO THE WHITE HOUSE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories for release
Sunday, May 30.
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DERRY, N.H. _ The Ford Explorer rips through hilly streets while
passenger John Kasich shuffles papers looking for the outline to
tomorrow morning's commencement speech. He's got the full text, but
he needs the outline.
</P>
<P>
   The outline, man!
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go from a prepared text,'' he said, ``and these things
are becoming more and more important. Now we've got 1,200 people
tomorrow and I haven't spent 10 seconds thinking about it. Of
course, if I think about it for 10 seconds or 10 hours, it doesn't
really change things much.''
</P>
<P>
   He has just left an evening meeting with GOP leaders in
Goffstown and is on his way to a wine-and-cheese in Derry and he's
been invited back to the local television station at 11 p.m. to do
one more live shot for the day. Naturally, he can't say no to TV so
he's fretting about when he can work through his speech to the
graduating class at New Hampshire Community Technical College.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse is that even when he's crunched for prep
time, Kasich alone decides how he's going to say what he wants to
say. He will not simply read a speech. Or he can't. Or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read,'' he said, ``it just doesn't come from the
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a single word to explain why this modestly
well-known congressman from Columbus, Ohio, is campaigning for the
Republican nomination for president, this is it. Heart.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard the phrase ``fire in the belly'' to be president?
Well, Kasich's whole abdomen is fully involved. Belly, lungs, bones
and heart.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich is the antithesis of Gov. George W. Bush, the anointed
Texan who so far has been aloof and unavailable to campaign for
president even while the GOP establishment has lined up behind him.
Where Bush is financially secure, in command of the polls and
building unparalleled party support without leaving Texas, Kasich
is hustling for every buck, nearly invisible on TV and wearing out
shoes trying to meet every man, woman and child in New Hampshire
and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich tells you this doesn't intimidate him, and his friends in
Washington and Columbus tell you he means it. Kasich believes he
should be campaigning for the presidency right now, and that's all
there is to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When John believes,'' said longtime friend Rep. David L.
Hobson, R-Ohio, ``he believes.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in 1978 Kasich was a 26-year-old staffer in the
Ohio Senate who believed he should be a state senator. So he quit
his job and began a door-to-door-to-door campaign that 13 months
later culminated in his unseating a prominent Democrat whose family
name adorned a large funeral home and the local landmark dam.
</P>
<P>
   It was such a long shot even local Republicans didn't want to
put their stamp on his candidacy, barely bothering to endorse
``shaggy John,'' the recent Ohio State University graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shocker,'' said Bob Blair, who was the Republican
Party's other Senate staffer. ``We said, `You can't do this!' It
was an upset for all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, while in Columbus, fellow Republicans asked Kasich to do
something he didn't believe in _ raise taxes. So at 28 he protested
by writing his own budget for the state of Ohio. Today he refers to
that as the event that ``unleashed John Kasich.''
</P>
<P>
   From the state legislature, Kasich went on to believe he should
run for Congress, which led to the nation's only Republican victory
over a Democratic incumbent in 1982. And since he believed in
greater fiscal restraint than he was seeing from Washington
leaders, he wrote or co-wrote his own version of the federal budget
in 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993 and 1994. He maneuvered them all to the
House floor for votes, but none came close to passing.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1995, Republicans were in the majority and Kasich was
chairman of the Budget Committee _ a job he won by outworking a
senior lawmaker from North Carolina. Suddenly, Kasich's obsessive
drive to balance the federal budget matured from a quixotic
adventure to a rational goal. Buoyed by a roaring economy that
dramatically raised the government's income, the Kasich-negotiated
spending plan became America's first balanced budget in 30 years
when President Clinton signed it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kasich debates with himself, and sometimes his presidential
exploratory committee staff, about how much of the Budget Committee
wars he should include in his stump speeches in New Hampshire and
Iowa, home of the first two presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of why I need to talk about what I've done in the past is
to show them that I'm the one guy who actually has moved
mountains,'' he said from the Explorer's front seat. ``A lot of
what I say, people might think is too idealistic. But, boy, I've
been able to get a tremendous amount done in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a budget speech for commencement? Naw, he thinks. A
recounting of his effort to abolish the B-2, which led to a
reduction in the number produced? No, these kids don't want that,
man.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, bigger than the question of what to say to technical
college graduates is the looming, seeping, pervasive issue of
whether Kasich's tenacity can move this biggest mountain of all:
the presidential nomination of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a quirky campaign with a quirky candidate who has
absolutely no chance to be elected president of the United States
in 2000,'' said Washington political analyst Stuart Rothenberg.
``No chance.''
</P>
<P>
   What's quirky about Kasich is that he loves (and knows)
contemporary rock n' roll, campaigns in Iowa against federal
subsidies for a sacred local product called ethanol or against the
Lakers in Los Angeles, and is happy to speak at a Democratic
fund-raiser if a close friend and Democrat asks.
</P>
<P>
   The picture of the sedate, sober, cautious politician doesn't
apply to Kasich. You hear the term ``boyish'' around him a lot,
which some observers, like Rothenberg, say is the root of his
problem. The knock on Kasich is that he's too energetic, too eager,
too undisciplined to read a prepared speech, for heaven's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is 47, he looks 37 and he acts 27,'' Rothenberg said. ``He
lacks the maturity that people want to see in their president.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kasich, and those close to him, say critics like Rothenberg
are missing the big picture. They say it's a mistake to confuse
enthusiasm and energy with immaturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's his freshness,'' Hobson said. ``I'm not quite sure
why that happens, because he's very mature in his thinking, he's
very conservative about money, which are attributes of a mature
person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as his views go, and as far as his emotions go , I can
tell you he's a very mature person. I've seen him in major
negotiations with White House people where he was the strongest one
in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kasich: ``It's good that they underestimate me. ... When
you're thinking about being president of the United States and
people look at you and think you're boyish, you have to work extra
hard. On the other hand, it means that I can do 18 more events than
anybody else, so I wouldn't trade it.''
</P>
<P>
   As an indelible function of his personality, Kasich's speaking
style is boisterous to the point of nearly being fervent. When John
believes, he believes out loud. He delivers a message of broad
populism that says returning authority and taxes to people will
raise their feelings of control, heighten their sense of
responsibility for the world, and restore a spirit of hope.
</P>
<P>
   And he says it with a delivery that most closely resembles the
blam-blam football commentary of John Madden. A Kasich speech is
filled with ``You know whats?'' and ``I'll tell you whys!''
</P>
<P>
   On religion in politics: ``A lot of people say they're of faith,
but they're not. It's like me standing in my garage and saying I'm
a Ford Escort. I mean, just 'cause I say it doesn't make it so.''
</P>
<P>
   On schools: ``Public education is not going to improve without
competition (in the form of tax-funded vouchers that let parents
pay for private school). The fear of opening it up is really a
comment on how much we trust mothers and fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   On making faith in God a feature of his campaign: ``I'm not into
this to be a preacher; if I wanted to be a preacher I would have
gone to seminary. But at the same time, I think it's appropriate
for me to reflect the fact that I think faith is important to a
great society. And also, I tell people because I think it's a good
tip. It's like giving a guy a tip on how to hit a golf ball. I
think it's an important part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   On George W. Bush: ``I don't underestimate the challenge, but
you know what, everybody has a tough challenge. He has a long way
to go. He can't get the green jacket (of the Masters tournament
champion) until he plays all 18 holes, and it's just amazing what
can happen in one round of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   And he isn't alone in his thinking. For every Rothenberg who
doubts, there's a Charles Cook, whose Cook Political Report in
Washington rivals Rothenberg's publication, who finds Kasich to be
too forceful a personality to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an interesting person,'' said Cook, who saw Kasich in New
Hampshire recently. ``He's got a magnetic personality and you kind
of feel good listening to him. You see a lot of ordinary people
nodding their heads a lot when he's speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook's view is that the Bush juggernaut is likely to steam
unimpeded into the nomination for president, but there's a chance
Bush, still a novice campaigner, will stumble long enough to give
the trailing pack a chance.
</P>
<P>
   And in a group that includes Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Sen.
John McCain, Steve Forbes, Patrick Buchanan, Lamar Alexander,
Christian activist Gary Bauer, Sen. Bob Smith and Baltimore radio
personality Alan Keyes, Cook sees Kasich as a fresh face with the
potential to break through and fill the gap a Bush mistake could
create.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's a long shot, but I wouldn't rule him out,'' Cook
said. ``There's just too much talent (in Kasich) and too many
uncertainties about the race to rule him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Cook said Kasich has drawn together a highly respected
campaign team that includes veterans such as communications
strategist Ed Gillespie and pollster Ed Goeas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John Kasich had no chance, you wouldn't have the type of
people in the Republican Party signing up to work with him,'' Cook
said. ``Either these guys aren't as smart as their reputations, or
this isn't crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kasich strategy is simple. He knows he can't match Bush's
reported $50 million (he'll be happy to collect $18 million,
although so far he hasn't filed reports with the Federal Election
Commission because he formed his exploratory committee in Ohio.)
But with the primary season condensed into a few key days in
February and March, Kasich is hoping heavy publicity generated by a
surprisingly strong showing in New Hampshire and Iowa will catapult
him into contention in primaries in California and New York weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a nationwide primary, right off the bat it would be
beyond my reach,'' Kasich said. ``But the fact is there are three
launch sites in America: Cape Canaveral, Iowa and New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   But first he must overcome the notion in his own party that Bush
is the only choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party tends to almost honor the divine right of kings,''
Kasich said. ``Frankly, the inability of my party to have an open,
raucous, tumultuous debate of ideas and people limits the ability
of the party to excite. The question is, can we get out of that
habit in this election?''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate question is, what is he going to say to the
graduating class of New Hampshire Community Technical College in
Nashua? An enormous tent has been pitched on the lawn this Saturday
morning and Kasich is inside now working through his philosophy on
how to succeed in life.
</P>
<P>
   He squeezes a little of his Budget Committee history into the
part about perseverance, but only a little. He talks about
believing in your dreams, in loving yourself, in loving your
neighbors, in finding time to laugh, in sharing your gifts with
others.
</P>
<P>
   He never mentions that he's running for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``And maybe at the end,'' he says in closing, `` people will be
able to say the world is a little better because we came this
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the audience rises into a sustained ovation. A man, up
out of his folding chair, volunteers with raised eyebrows, ``Good
speaker!''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Cote of Nashua had never heard of John Kasich and had no
idea he was exploring a run for the presidency. Cote just came to
see his 27-year-old daughter getting her life back on track with a
degree in massage therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll do well,'' he said of Kasich. ``He has a good
sense of direction about him.''

AT THIS RATE, WE'LL BE GLOBAL IN ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
 (dw)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anything seems obvious today, it is that globalization is a
new and powerful force that is erasing national borders and linking
the world in an unprecedented web of trade and investments. As one
tycoon put it: ``The world is a city.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was Baron Carl Meyer von Rothschild, in 1875, reacting
as stock markets tumbled all around the world, in unison, feeding
off one another.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest myth about globalization is that it is new.
By some measures, its peak occurred a century ago, making the 20th
century memorable in economic history mostly for its retreat from
globalization. In some respects, only now is the world economy
becoming roughly as interlinked as it was more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not back to where we were 100 years ago,'' said
Charles Calomiris, a professor of finance and economics at the
Columbia University's Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Labor is less mobile than it was in the last century. In those
days, passports were unnecessary and people could travel freely
from one country to the next, to visit or to work.
</P>
<P>
   That mobility led 60 million Europeans to move to the Americas
or Australia or elsewhere, and it helped fill up the United States.
In 1900, according to the census, 14 percent of the American
population was foreign born, compared with 8 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just labor. The 1860s and 1870s were a golden era for
free trade, and goods moved easily across borders. As late as 1879
an astonishing 95 percent of Germany's imports were still free of
duty. Low trade barriers led to an explosion of trade, so that
American exports soared to 7 percent of the gross national product
in the late 1900s; it is 8 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   Even capital seems to be less mobile now than in the 19th
century. A ``capital mobility index'' prepared by the International
Monetary Fund for a report in 1997 suggests that capital movements
as a proportion of economic output are still well below the levels
of the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   How can this be? A century ago, England and France invested
hugely in developing countries _ places like the United States,
Australia and Canada. England invested a larger share of its wealth
abroad at that time than it does now.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign capital financed one-third of domestic investment in New
Zealand and Canada in the late 19th century, and one-quarter in
Sweden. In contrast, foreign capital accounted for only about 10
percent of domestic investment in emerging markets in the 1990s,
according to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me as an economic historian, it was really the 19th century
that represented the birth of the global economy,'' said Alan
Taylor, an economist at Northwestern University. ``These days, it's
just getting back to where it was 100 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor suggested that 19th-century investors might well have had
a larger share of their stock portfolios invested abroad than
investors do today. He noted that Americans often have living rooms
full of goods from all over the world, but their portfolios still
tend to be focused in the United States. That discrepancy, he said,
may be an anachronism related to financial markets' being less
globalized than markets for goods (at least until recently).
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, globalization predates the 19th century.
Chinese demand for silver in the 16th through 18th centuries played
a role in financing the Spanish empire and the slave trade. China
absorbed perhaps half of the global production of silver, and that
bolstered prices and created wealth for mining magnates in the
Americas _ who traded their silver for slaves. After passing
through several hands, the silver was used to purchase Chinese
porcelain and silk.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is often said today that globalization is
irreversible, it proved very reversible early in this century.
After economic integration reached a peak in the late 19th century,
there was an astonishing retreat after World War I and especially
after the Great Depression. Since World War II, trade and
international investment rose again, and they have soared in the
last couple of decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first world war, we had a massive interruption and
reversal of the long-term trend,'' said Jagdish Bhagwati, an
international economist at Columbia University. ``One
interpretation is that now we're just climbing back on that
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, today's globalization is new in some important ways, and
arguably it touches many more people than the earlier kind.
</P>
<P>
   Bhagwati noted that trade in the 19th century consisted mostly
of commodities. Now it is mainly manufactured goods with parts from
so many countries that it is difficult to describe the finished
products as made in any one nation.
</P>
<P>
   Capital flows are also different, says David Hale, chief global
economist of the Zurich Group, a financial services company. In the
19th century, capital movements represented the savings of a
relatively small group of prosperous families in England and France
who were investing for the long term. Today investments are far
more broadly based, he said, and much more likely to be leveraged
and short term, more flighty and speculative.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that capital rushes around the globe much more
quickly than ever before, and is more prone to sweep into countries
and then out. Technology has created an electronic herd but as yet
no electronic cowboys to control the herd.
</P>
<P>
   For a world without telephones or computers, the 19th century
had its economic advantages. Output shot up and down like a roller
coaster, but mostly up. Calomiris has recorded 90 major banking
crises over the last 20 years, and he notes that they often led to
runs on national currencies. In contrast, in the period from 1870
to 1913, he can find only five major banking crises, and just one
of those led to an exchange-rate crisis. In many ways, he argues,
19th-century globalization worked better than today's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to recapture the successes of the earlier
period,'' Calomiris said, but he thinks it is worth a try. It may
seem heretical to tinker with the 21st-century process by looking
over one's shoulder for models a hundred years past, but it is a
reminder that globalization may well be older than nationalization.

AT THIS RATE, WE'LL BE GLOBAL IN ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS

<P>
   If anything seems obvious today, it is that globalization is a
new and powerful force that is erasing national borders and linking
the world in an unprecedented web of trade and investments. As one
tycoon put it: ``The world is a city.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was Baron Carl Meyer von Rothschild, in 1875, reacting
as stock markets tumbled all around the world, in unison, feeding
off one another.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest myth about globalization is that it is new.
By some measures, its peak occurred a century ago, making the 20th
century memorable in economic history mostly for its retreat from
globalization. In some respects, only now is the world economy
becoming roughly as interlinked as it was more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not back to where we were 100 years ago,'' said
Charles Calomiris, a professor of finance and economics at the
Columbia University's Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Labor is less mobile than it was in the last century. In those
days, passports were unnecessary and people could travel freely
from one country to the next, to visit or to work.
</P>
<P>
   That mobility led 60 million Europeans to move to the Americas
or Australia or elsewhere, and it helped fill up the United States.
In 1900, according to the census, 14 percent of the American
population was foreign born, compared with 8 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just labor. The 1860s and 1870s were a golden era for
free trade, and goods moved easily across borders. As late as 1879
an astonishing 95 percent of Germany's imports were still free of
duty. Low trade barriers led to an explosion of trade, so that
American exports soared to 7 percent of the gross national product
in the late 1900s; it is 8 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   Even capital seems to be less mobile now than in the 19th
century. A ``capital mobility index'' prepared by the International
Monetary Fund for a report in 1997 suggests that capital movements
as a proportion of economic output are still well below the levels
of the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   How can this be? A century ago, England and France invested
hugely in developing countries _ places like the United States,
Australia and Canada. England invested a larger share of its wealth
abroad at that time than it does now.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign capital financed one-third of domestic investment in New
Zealand and Canada in the late 19th century, and one-quarter in
Sweden. In contrast, foreign capital accounted for only about 10
percent of domestic investment in emerging markets in the 1990s,
according to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me as an economic historian, it was really the 19th century
that represented the birth of the global economy,'' said Alan
Taylor, an economist at Northwestern University. ``These days, it's
just getting back to where it was 100 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor suggested that 19th-century investors might well have had
a larger share of their stock portfolios invested abroad than
investors do today. He noted that Americans often have living rooms
full of goods from all over the world, but their portfolios still
tend to be focused in the United States. That discrepancy, he said,
may be an anachronism related to financial markets' being less
globalized than markets for goods (at least until recently).
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, globalization predates the 19th century.
Chinese demand for silver in the 16th through 18th centuries played
a role in financing the Spanish empire and the slave trade. China
absorbed perhaps half of the global production of silver, and that
bolstered prices and created wealth for mining magnates in the
Americas _ who traded their silver for slaves. After passing
through several hands, the silver was used to purchase Chinese
porcelain and silk.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is often said today that globalization is
irreversible, it proved very reversible early in this century.
After economic integration reached a peak in the late 19th century,
there was an astonishing retreat after World War I and especially
after the Great Depression. Since World War II, trade and
international investment rose again, and they have soared in the
last couple of decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first world war, we had a massive interruption and
reversal of the long-term trend,'' said Jagdish Bhagwati, an
international economist at Columbia University. ``One
interpretation is that now we're just climbing back on that
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, today's globalization is new in some important ways, and
arguably it touches many more people than the earlier kind.
</P>
<P>
   Bhagwati noted that trade in the 19th century consisted mostly
of commodities. Now it is mainly manufactured goods with parts from
so many countries that it is difficult to describe the finished
products as made in any one nation.
</P>
<P>
   Capital flows are also different, says David Hale, chief global
economist of the Zurich Group, a financial services company. In the
19th century, capital movements represented the savings of a
relatively small group of prosperous families in England and France
who were investing for the long term. Today investments are far
more broadly based, he said, and much more likely to be leveraged
and short term, more flighty and speculative.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that capital rushes around the globe much more
quickly than ever before, and is more prone to sweep into countries
and then out. Technology has created an electronic herd but as yet
no electronic cowboys to control the herd.
</P>
<P>
   For a world without telephones or computers, the 19th century
had its economic advantages. Output shot up and down like a roller
coaster, but mostly up. Calomiris has recorded 90 major banking
crises over the last 20 years, and he notes that they often led to
runs on national currencies. In contrast, in the period from 1870
to 1913, he can find only five major banking crises, and just one
of those led to an exchange-rate crisis. In many ways, he argues,
19th-century globalization worked better than today's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to recapture the successes of the earlier
period,'' Calomiris said, but he thinks it is worth a try. It may
seem heretical to tinker with the 21st-century process by looking
over one's shoulder for models a hundred years past, but it is a
reminder that globalization may well be older than nationalization.

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
traveled to the United States early this month, and everywhere he
went the same people who four months before were worrying about an
Asian-style meltdown of Brazil's economy praised him for his astute
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton led the chorus, expressing
relief at ``the substantial progress'' Brazil had made in
recovering from the fiscal crisis, which led to a 40 percent
devaluation of its currency in January.
</P>
<P>
   During his tour Cardoso also stopped in New York, where he was
peppered with questions about Brazil's implementation of a $41.5
billion economic rescue package backed by the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Left unaddressed, however, was a more fundamental issue: To what
extent did the crisis reflect genuine deficiencies in the Brazilian
economy and to what degree was it a self-fulfilling prophecy,
brought on by panic and myopia in the global capital market itself?
</P>
<P>
   At this juncture, no one denies that Brazil's currency, the
real, had become overvalued against the dollar and needed to be
adjusted. Throughout his first term, Cardoso's main policy goal had
been to bring inflation, traditionally the country's biggest
bugaboo, under control; that made him eager to avoid any sharp and
sudden devaluation and the surge of higher prices that would follow
it.
</P>
<P>
   But Brazilians, from officials to the average citizen, are
increasingly convinced that a series of ``simplistic comparisons''
and ``undue generalizations,'' as Minister of Finance Pedro Malan
put it in a recent interview, made the situation last January worse
than it might have been and overlooked the country's underlying
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the world's eighth-largest economy has begun to right
itself, for example, all the talk about ``global contagion'' seems
particularly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Except in the estimation of some traders abroad, Brazil was
never really comparable to Indonesia, where a family dynasty
enriched itself at the country's expense. Nor was it equivalent to
Russia, where the collapse of a communist state has allowed a mafia
to seize control of the economy, or even Mexico, where one corrupt
and ossified political party has wielded power for 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street needs a geography lesson,'' Marcus Vinicius
Pratini de Moraes, a former Cabinet minister who is now president
of the Brazilian Association of Exporters, said recently. ``A bank
goes bust in Moscow and they sell their Brazilian shares? They
should go back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late for Brazil and its 165 million people, who have had to
endure lost jobs and recession since January, stock markets around
the world seemed to recognize that error this month.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, speculative pressure on Argentina and its currency last
week generated some turbulence here and in other Latin American
countries. But Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov in Russia caused barely a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the announcement was being made in Moscow, the Sao
Paulo stock market rose to an 18-month high, fueled largely by the
return of foreign money, and the Brazilian government was able to
announce the sixth cut in interest rates in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures of Brazil's strengths are, if anything, more
revealing. In contrast to the traumas that have wracked Russia and
the Asian tigers recently, Latin America's largest country has in
just 15 years successfully made the transition, without violence or
social trauma, from military dictatorship to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Its democracy is often raucous, as is demonstrated by a current
congressional investigation into insider trading that took place at
the time of January's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Cardoso has to work within a system of checks
and balances more restrictive than the systems facing his Asian,
Russian and Mexican counterparts, he has time and again delivered
on promises to restructure the Brazilian state and economy.
</P>
<P>
   After the agreement with the IMF was signed last November,
investors and officials abroad immediately began to view a
reduction of Brazil's often-generous social security benefits as a
test of Cardoso's resolve. Though the Brazilian Congress dithered
for two months, it eventually passed the legislation, which
requires a constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   As political leaders here have noted, none of the countries that
have been hectoring Brazil on this matter _ not Germany, not
France, not Italy, and certainly not the United States _ have
themselves begun to come to grips with the issue at home.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the steps Brazil had taken to modernize its economy
even before the January crisis were substantial, more than what
many other countries have done in decades. When he took office in
1995, Cardoso inherited a highly protectionist economy. But he
quickly lowered tariffs, allowing trade and competition to surge,
and sold off one inefficient state-run monopoly after another:
ports, electricity, mining, telecommunications, railways, banks and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso maintained that course, showing unusual political
courage, even when a harsh recession set in after the eruption of
the Asian crisis in 1997, threatening both his re-election and
efforts to stabilize both prices and the real. Brazilian voters
were mature enough to resist opposition blandishments of short-term
relief in favor of what they saw as the long-term payoff that would
make their country an economic power: stability and growth.
</P>
<P>
   The late Carroll Quigley, the Georgetown University professor
whom Clinton has cited as his most influential teacher, used to
define capitalism as ``a system of accounting that ignores social
costs.'' Judging from Brazil's recent experience, the converse is
also true: market-driven philosophies are unwilling to grant credit
for social gains that cannot immediately be measured.
</P>
<P>
   To Riordan Roett, an expert on the Western Hemisphere at Johns
Hopkins University, Cardoso's most significant achievement may be
that during his first term ``more Brazilians were lifted from
poverty than in the past 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That feat, a result of the same inflation control and currency
stabilization program that came under speculative pressure in
January, has turned millions of poor Brazilians into consumers and
makes the country more attractive to foreign investors hunting for
new markets.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the crisis, a new study appeared here showing
that between 1994 and 1998, high school enrollments in Brazil
increased 37 percent, as parents realized that they no longer
needed to yank their children out of classes and send them to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are extraordinary numbers for so short a period,'' a
``gigantic leap,'' Claudio de Moura Castro, an economist who is the
co-author of the study, wrote in the news magazine Veja.

THE GUN DEBATE HAS TWO SIDES. NOW, A THIRD WAY. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(DW) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate made a bit of history last week, passing
gun-control legislation that had been left for dead a week before.
</P>
<P>
   The measures are modest, which may suggest that anti-gun-control
forces remain powerful despite concern over shooting incidents at
schools. But the fact that they passed at all suggests that a
center may be forming in a debate that has been dominated by two
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus seems to be behind measures to keep guns out of
the hands of children and criminals without seriously restricting
the ability of law-abiding adults to own firearms.
</P>
<P>
   It could all fall apart when gun-control legislation goes before
the House of Representatives, probably next month. The war could
then begin anew between those who want to go so far as to ban the
sale of inexpensive handguns and require all guns to be registered
with the police and those who believe Americans have the right to
own and carry guns more or less at will.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote for gun control in the Senate on Thursday, a month
after the massacre in Littleton, Colo., and the day of a
frightening shooting in a high school in Conyers, Ga., could mark a
turning point _ a first small step toward a middle ground between
the extremes on an extraordinarily divisive political topic.
</P>
<P>
   Parallels can be found on other issues. Consider, for instance,
health care and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades after World War II, one of the fiercest battles
in American politics was fought between those who wanted a national
health insurance system and those who thought any government role
in health care would amount to socialized medicine. The result was
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1965, Medicare and Medicaid were established providing
government insurance for the elderly, the disabled and the poor.
Those programs became almost instantly popular. Health insurance
has remained an issue in American politics. But the question is no
longer one of extremes _ whether the government should be in
control or excluded _ but rather what the extent of the government
involvement should be.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, politicians were caught for years between those who
wanted to outlaw the practice and those who believed that women
should have an unrestricted right to terminate their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Supreme Court found a point in between. The court
reaffirmed Roe vs. Wade, its 1973 decision establishing a
constitutional right to abortion, but the new ruling enabled states
to impose restrictions like requiring minors to notify their
parents before they had an abortion and imposing a waiting period
between a pregnant woman's first visit to a doctor for an abortion
and the procedure itself.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans seem comfortable with this compromise, which
appears to have taken the abortion debate out of the hands of the
interest groups that had set its terms. It defused abortion as a
defining political issue so thoroughly that even Pat Robertson, the
founder of the Christian Coalition, is now saying it is pointless
to fight for a constitutional ban on abortion because it would
never pass.
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of gun-control advocates, the measures
approved last week by the Senate, with Vice President Al Gore
casting the tie-breaking vote, are distinctly tame. They would
require background checks before firearms could be purchased at gun
shows or reclaimed at pawn shops; they would require childproof
safety locks or storage boxes to be sold with all handguns, and
they would restrict the access of children under 18 to
semiautomatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic sponsors of the legislation were careful to frame
the issue as one of child safety. They did not even try to restore
a waiting period for handgun purchases, a provision of the 1994
Brady law that has since expired. ``This debate has really been
about common sense, moderate efforts to limit the accessibility and
availability of weapons to children,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Even many Republicans who opposed the bill _ as all but six of
the 55 Republican senators did _ endorsed the principle of keeping
guns from children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do everything in our power to reduce the availability
of guns to young people,'' said Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who
voted against the bill but has made it clear in his campaign for
the Republican presidential nomination that he is not averse to all
restrictions on gun ownership. McCain's leading rivals for the
nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Elizabeth Dole, have
also indicated they can support some kinds of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Not all politicians and scholars on gun control agree that the
Senate vote was a turning point. That will not come until the
politicians require guns to be licensed and gun owners to be
trained, said James Q. Wilson, a retired professor of public policy
at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a prominent
expert on guns and crime. ``I didn't see much in the Senate debate
that would encourage me to think that's in the offing,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leading politicians here are still at odds. After the vote, Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, insisted that
guns should not be blamed for shootings in schools. ``Guns don't
cause people to do these things,'' Lott said. ``When do we put the
responsibility on the individuals? That's who causes the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to that argument, Gore steered the issue back to
keeping children out of trouble. ``We used to have a problem with
aspirin poisoning of children in our country,'' he said, ``and we
appealed for better parenting and better parental controls of
children, but not until there were childproof caps on the aspirins
did the problem get significantly solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Washington, the consensus behind keeping guns away from
children may be even stronger than it is here. Gov. Frank Keating
of Oklahoma, a Republican who keeps a .38-caliber pistol in his
night stand and who is an ardent opponent of restrictive gun
control, said in a telephone interview, ``Even in a sportsman state
like Oklahoma, people believe there are few if any circumstances
when children should have unrestricted access to weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who now views Washington
politics from a distance as the director of the Institute of
Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard,
said the Senate's vote on gun control confirmed a favorite theory
of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extremists on both sides eventually become exposed,'' Simpson
said. ``People on the edges of the left and right then tumble down
toward the middle. This is what happened on abortion, on
immigration, on the environment, on nuclear power. And now it's
happening on guns.''

THE GUN DEBATE HAS TWO SIDES. NOW, A THIRD WAY. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(DW) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate made a bit of history last week, passing
gun-control legislation that had been left for dead a week before.
</P>
<P>
   The measures are modest, which may suggest that anti-gun-control
forces remain powerful despite concern over shooting incidents at
schools. But the fact that they passed at all suggests that a
center may be forming in a debate that has been dominated by two
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus seems to be behind measures to keep guns out of
the hands of children and criminals without seriously restricting
the ability of law-abiding adults to own firearms.
</P>
<P>
   It could all fall apart when gun-control legislation goes before
the House of Representatives, probably next month. The war could
then begin anew between those who want to go so far as to ban the
sale of inexpensive handguns and require all guns to be registered
with the police and those who believe Americans have the right to
own and carry guns more or less at will.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote for gun control in the Senate on Thursday, a month
after the massacre in Littleton, Colo., and the day of a
frightening shooting in a high school in Conyers, Ga., could mark a
turning point _ a first small step toward a middle ground between
the extremes on an extraordinarily divisive political topic.
</P>
<P>
   Parallels can be found on other issues. Consider, for instance,
health care and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades after World War II, one of the fiercest battles
in American politics was fought between those who wanted a national
health insurance system and those who thought any government role
in health care would amount to socialized medicine. The result was
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1965, Medicare and Medicaid were established providing
government insurance for the elderly, the disabled and the poor.
Those programs became almost instantly popular. Health insurance
has remained an issue in American politics. But the question is no
longer one of extremes _ whether the government should be in
control or excluded _ but rather what the extent of the government
involvement should be.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, politicians were caught for years between those who
wanted to outlaw the practice and those who believed that women
should have an unrestricted right to terminate their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Supreme Court found a point in between. The court
reaffirmed Roe vs. Wade, its 1973 decision establishing a
constitutional right to abortion, but the new ruling enabled states
to impose restrictions like requiring minors to notify their
parents before they had an abortion and imposing a waiting period
between a pregnant woman's first visit to a doctor for an abortion
and the procedure itself.
</P>

THE COURT RESURRECTS A CIVIL-WAR-ERA IDEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
 (dw)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In constitutional law, as in geology, things can
look perfectly stable on the surface _ until the tectonic plates
shift underneath.
</P>
<P>
   As the Supreme Court term heads into its final weeks, the
question is whether such a shift may be under way. In its decision
last week striking down California's reduced welfare benefits for
newcomers to the state, the court relied on a portion of the 14th
Amendment that forbids states to restrict the ``privileges or
immunities'' of American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   This is the long-neglected privileges-or-immunities clause, the
sudden resurrection of which, by a broad 7-2 majority, was
certainly one of the most surprising and possibly one of the most
consequential constitutional developments in years.
</P>
<P>
   The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868 to ratify the outcome of the
Civil War, says in its first paragraph, ``No state shall make or
enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of
citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any
person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;
nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection
of the laws.''
</P>
<P>
   There is historical evidence that the amendment's drafters
regarded the privileges-or-immunities clause as more important than
the much-invoked guarantees of due process and equal protection
that it precedes in the text.
</P>
<P>
   But the clause was sent into early eclipse by an 1873 Supreme
Court decision known as the Slaughter-House cases, which held that
the clause protected only the rights of national citizenship and
placed no new obligations on the states.
</P>
<P>
   So by turning back to this long-buried language, the court was
taking at least a tentative step on a new path of constitutional
analysis. While the ultimate destination is uncertain, it appeals
to both conservatives, who see the clause as a new source for
protection for property and economic rights, and weary liberals,
who see it as a means for protecting individual rights without
having to fight endless battles over the meaning of due process.
</P>
<P>
   Justices across the ideological spectrum signed their names to
this opinion, from John Paul Stevens, its author and arguably the
court's most liberal member, to Antonin Scalia, one of the most
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   While Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, disagreeing that
welfare was one of the historically protected privileges, he made
clear his enthusiasm for reconsidering the privileges-or-immunities
clause in an ``appropriate case.'' That left Chief Justice William
Rehnquist oddly isolated in his complaint that ``the court today
breathes new life into the previously dormant privileges or
immunities clause,'' an observation that the majority did not
rebut.
</P>
<P>
   The justices who came together in the California welfare case,
Saenz vs. Roe, did not necessarily do so for the same reasons, or
with the same expectations of where this new opening might lead.
The privileges-or-immunities clause has been invisible for so long
that there are few recognizable signposts, and there were no
concurring opinions by which individual members of the majority
might have elaborated on the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But at the least, to carry the geological analogy a step
further, the opinion undoubtedly achieved a release of doctrinal
tension much as an earthquake relieves pressure that builds up
under the Earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   The two-tiered welfare program challenged in this case was quite
clearly unconstitutional under the court's most directly relevant
precedent, a 1969 decision called Shapiro vs. Thompson that invoked
a constitutional ``right to travel'' to bar states from denying
welfare benefits during a newcomer's first year of residency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was probably no member of the current court completely
at ease with the analytic method that produced Shapiro vs.
Thompson. That decision represented a kind of high-water mark of
the Warren court's open-ended approach to constitutional analysis _
so much so that Chief Justice Earl Warren himself dissented from
Justice William Brennan's majority opinion, which candidly conceded
that the right to travel was not anchored to any particular place
in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no occasion to ascribe the source of this right to
travel interstate to a particular constitutional provision,''
Brennan wrote. It goes without saying that there are no
Warren-court-style liberals on the court today. Briefs from a group
of states and other interested parties in the current case urged
the justices simply to overrule the 1969 precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in Stevens' practiced hands, the right to travel did
not disappear but morphed into a right of national citizenship that
each state is obliged to honor and that, more to the point, has a
solid foundation in the Constitution's text. For the court's
moderate justices, the privileges-or-immunities clause offers a
comfort zone that permits them to defend individual rights while
shedding the baggage of liberal methodology.
</P>
<P>
   For conservatives, particularly those with libertarian leanings
like Thomas, the appeal of the clause is even clearer. There is no
dispute that, as a matter of history, the privileges the
amendment's drafters sought to protect included the right to earn a
living, enter into contracts and acquire and maintain property free
of government interference _ all aspects of the natural law
philosophy that inspired the signers of the Declaration of
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   The privileges-or-immunities clause should be used to restore
``the fundamental connection between the Constitution and its
natural law foundations,'' Roger Pilon, director of constitutional
studies for the Cato Institute, a libertarian policy group here,
wrote in a law review article several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   One result would be, Pilon argues, to raise the level of
protection for economic rights, like unrestricted land use, which
receive only minimal scrutiny under current constitutional
analysis, to the level of protection given to individual rights
that under the current approach are deemed ``fundamental.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it is clear that the justices in a sense are
simply catching up with a lively discussion that has been going on
for some time among legal academics and constitutional historians.
A broad, although by no means universal, consensus has emerged that
the Slaughter-House decision of 1873 was based on a mistaken
understanding of the intent of the drafters.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the court has spoken, however tentatively, that
conversation will expand to a wider audience. Arguments based on
privileges or immunities will be developed in law review articles
and presented to lower court judges, who in turn will write
opinions that will provide more raw material for the court, if the
justices want to use it to move further down the new path.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the court does not act in isolation from the rest of the
legal system, cases on its docket do not exist in isolation from
one another. Between now and the end of next month, the justices
will announce decisions in three cases that challenge the power of
the federal government with respect to the states.
</P>
<P>
   It would be surprising if the court did not continue on its
recent course of shifting power away from Congress, a result the
states are actively seeking. But new power may come with a price
if, as California learned on Monday, the court at the same time is
placing new obligations on the states to safeguard the rights of
all their citizens.

   It seemed at the time to be a curiously outmoded interpretation.
What? It had nothing to do with his galvanizing personality as
prime minister, the way he alienated and divided even his Cabinet?
Was everyone really harkening back to 1995, when Netanyahu, the
opposition leader, was accused of legitimizing an atmosphere of
incitement against the prime minister, Rabin?
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Barak's victory last week, when tens of
thousands of young Israelis burned memorial candles for Rabin in
the square where he was assassinated, it was clear that Netanyahu _
``Bibi,'' as Israel called him _ had a point.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the Rabin assassination was an undigested
trauma for many Israelis, and that Barak's victory allowed a kind
of public catharsis of repressed grief over a national martyr whose
death at the hands of an extremist Jew changed the way many
Israelis felt about being Israeli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bibi is still being held responsible and he probably has to be
retired for the country to get beyond Rabin's murder,'' Yaron
Ezrahi, a political scientist, said several days before Netanyahu's
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Barak understood this, too. He is skillfully navigating his way
through the lingering images of Rabin, his own military and
political mentor. On election night, to declare his victory, he
joined the huge crowd that had converged on Rabin Square in Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   It was his night, but he celebrated amid huge banner pictures of
the slain prime minister. He stood beside Rabin's widow, Leah. He
looked into the sky and he talked directly to Rabin. He effectively
dedicated to him his electoral triumph, a landslide by Israeli
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Barak's first act as prime minister-elect was
to visit the Rabin grave, as if to lay to rest once and for all the
great sadness before taking his first steps into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as prime minister, Barak's challenge will be to diverge
from the model of his mentor, to emulate Rabin and, having learned
from his political mistakes, to move beyond him. He quickly made
clear that he intends to do so. He moved instantly to start
negotiating a broad coalition government, rather than rely on a
razor-thin majority as Rabin did.
</P>
<P>
   If Rabin's life was ended by the blood passions in Israeli
society, then successfully following in his footsteps means healing
Israel. It means being slightly less of a commander, and more of a
consensus builder.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rabin, Barak, 57, represents the old Israel. He is the very
model of the Zionist pioneer man. His mother lost nearly her whole
family in Treblinka. His father grew up an orphan after his family
was killed in a pogrom in Lithuania. He was born on a kibbutz
before Israel was born as a state. He spent his life defending the
dream of Israel, rising steadily through the elite military ranks
to become army chief of staff. He is Ashkenazi, a descendant of
Europeans; he plays classical piano; he is resolutely secular.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a typical representative of the species of new man the
fathers of the Zionist movement tried to create in Israel,'' Tom
Segev, an author, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate insider, Barak is coming to power at a moment when
kibbutzim are aging, or turning into shopping centers, and when the
supposed outsiders _ the Sephardim, who came from Middle Eastern
countries; the Russian immigrants, the ultra-Orthodox _ are
redefining what it means to be Israeli.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis who voted for Barak said they would have much
preferred to see a new breed of political leader arise, to see
citizen-candidates rather than generals. After all, the era of the
great wars is fading. Barak's classic acts of heroism _ leading a
unit that liberated a Sabena airplane from hijackers at Tel Aviv in
1972, for instance _ happened a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe, they said last week, Israel is not ready for
political normalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week I wrote about Barak that he is a somewhat outdated
portrait of Israel,'' Ofer Shelah, a columnist for the newspaper
Maariv, said last week. ``But we are lucky that is the case: We
need someone who can take us back a little, to the days when being
Israeli was an aspiration and not something accursed.''
</P>
<P>
   As a peacemaker, Barak is no radical. He does not talk, as did
Shimon Peres, his predecessor at the helm of Labor, about forging a
new Middle East in which Israelis and Palestinians live in a
harmonious political and economic integration. He aspires to
separation from the Palestinians; they have their land, Israel has
its land, and everyone goes about their business.
</P>
<P>
   It is the ideology of the pre-state kibbutzniks.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, in the wake of their gloating enthusiasm about
Netanyahu's loss, started listening more carefully to Barak's
oratory and getting depressed about the hard line he took. But
Barak is very different from his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   He does not consider himself to be the reluctant inheritor of
international peace agreements he'd just as soon renege on, as
Netanyahu did. Instead, he is determined to build on the existing
agreements, establish professional diplomatic relationships with
the Arab world and move expeditiously toward final settlement with
Israel's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In a documentary film by Claude Lanzmann, Barak, who is
interviewed, says he sees Jewish history as a struggle between
fanaticism or extremism and pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   The purists, he says, have ended up dead, like the zealots who
killed themselves at Masada. Barak is not a zealot _ just as his
mentor Yitzhak Rabin wasn't. Unlike Rabin, though, he comes into
power at a time when the right wing has withered.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin trod a path for him, and Netanyahu, a reluctant
peacemaker, nonetheless continued down the same road.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a time when pragmatism, at least on the issue of
peace, has a better chance.

   JERUSALEM _ A month before he was resoundingly defeated last
Monday by Ehud Barak, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu explained
in an interview that attacks on his personality reflected one key
thing: the Israeli left's continuing need to blame somebody for the
assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed at the time to be a curiously outmoded interpretation.
What? It had nothing to do with his galvanizing personality as
prime minister, the way he alienated and divided even his Cabinet?

(Repeating for all needing.) FINDING SPIES IS THE EASY PART  
(The Week in Review)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reports from an investigation by a House committee
last week seemed to leave little doubt: Beijing's theft of secrets
from American nuclear weapons laboratories led to spectacular gains
by China in creating a modern thermonuclear arsenal. The
penetration went deeper and was more devastating than anyone had
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Turf-conscious national security officials, called to account at
acrimonious congressional hearings, have blamed one another, and
one scientist has been fired.
</P>
<P>
   But officials have not been able to explain exactly why no one
has been arrested for crimes that enabled China to leap from 1950s
technology to an atomic force built on the most advanced research
of American laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   After all, for years the FBI has, seemingly routinely, ferreted
out spies, and the Justice Department has brought them to trial.
Just last week, in a much less important case, a former Australian
military intelligence analyst, Jean Philippe Wispelaere, was
arrested and charged with trying to sell more than 700 highly
classified American defense documents to an undercover FBI agent
who had posed as a spy.
</P>
<P>
   But veterans of espionage investigations, including former and
current intelligence and law enforcement officials, say that
slam-dunk cases like Wispelaere's are the exception. They offered a
variety of explanations for the government's inability to proceed
against the most significant figure to emerge in the nuclear
secrets case, Wen Ho Lee, the scientist fired from his job at the
Los Alamos National Laboratory. In a long explanation of his
activities, Lee has denied ever spying for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Given the government's faint trails of leads, some
law-enforcement officials say they are not convinced of his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The federal espionage law, which dates back to World War I, is
deceptively simple. It requires that prosecutors prove that a
defendant delivered, transmitted or attempted to communicate
classified national security information to a foreign power. A
stream of post-Cold War spy cases, from Aldrich Ames, the mole at
the CIA who spied for Russia, to Earl Edwin Pitts, who spied for
Russia at the FBI, have created the impression that spy cases are
no harder to crack than a sophisticated burglary ring.
</P>
<P>
   But counterintelligence officials say that espionage cases have
been among the most difficult because of the highly covert nature
of the crime, said John L. Martin, a former chief of the Justice
Department's Internal Security Section who is a lawyer at OSO
Group, a private investigative firm.
</P>
<P>
   In a bank robbery, he said, money is missing; in a homicide,
there is a body; in a kidnapping, someone disappears. But espionage
is a phantom act: Usually, nothing is missing, nothing is left
behind, and the victims may not know that they were a target.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for prosecutors, even well-schooled spies make mistakes.
In the case of Ames, after eight years as a mole for Moscow, his
profligate spending and maroon Jaguar in the CIA parking lot in
Langley, Va., aroused the suspicions of authorities. When agents
searched his house, they found in his bedroom closet a damning
spy's library of secret communications with the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons case involved secrets of W-88 technology, developed
by American scientists to miniaturize nuclear warheads. The theft
was not clearly understood in the United States until 1995, years
after the Chinese are believed to have acquired the information.
But by then the trail of the mole inside the weapons laboratory _
if there was one _ had grown cold, potential leads had dried up and
records from the mid-1980s, when the theft probably occurred, were
missing or incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Energy officials did not begin to suspect Lee
until 1995, and the FBI's investigation didn't begin until
mid-1996. Officials did not even know the information had been
pilfered until after W-88 technology was used by the Chinese in a
1992 test.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the investigation of Lee got under way, officials
have said, the case rested on evidence far too shaky to take to
court: his access to the highly classified W-88 information, his
travels to China and meetings with scientists there, and small but
potentially revealing incidents, like the time he was hugged by a
Chinese official in what seemed to be a congratulatory way.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Justice Department officials say the evidence
was so dated and tenuous that in 1997 they twice refused the FBI's
request to seek authorization for a warrant that would have
permitted agents to use wiretaps and other monitoring devices
against Lee. Agents posing as Chinese operatives even tried to lure
him into spying, but had no success.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials complained that aides to Attorney General Janet
Reno were wrong to deny their requests and failed to aggressively
back them. As a result they did not search his computer until
earlier this year. That's when they found that he had transferred a
huge cache of highly classified nuclear design codes into an
unclassified computer.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear what happened to the data. If the government
had evidence that the information went to a foreign power, Lee
would probably be under arrest. It is uncertain whether he violated
laws against mishandling classified material.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the specifics of Lee case, American officials said they
have had difficulty in thwarting Chinese intelligence efforts.
Beijing's operations are far less structured than the spying
activities of traditional adversaries. The Chinese rely heavily on
getting information from Chinese professionals and students in the
United States who travel between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, most American counterintelligence agents are
trained in the spy-vs.-spy craft of the old Soviet KGB and East
bloc intelligence agencies. Instead of relying on case officers who
recruit people to steal information, Chinese intelligence
operations focus on scientist-to-scientist technical meetings in
China.

HONG KONG SEEKS ITS OWN CHINESE WALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

 By MARK LANDLER

<P>
   HONG KONG _ China's newest city is crowded, expensive, polluted
and mired in its worst recession since World War II. Yet to listen
to Hong Kong's leaders, every person in mainland China with the
slightest claim to live here would scramble across the border if
the gates were opened.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Hong Kong has been in a lather over the prospect
that it is about to be inundated by Chinese immigrants. The fears,
which began after a court here granted residency to mainland
Chinese who have at least one parent in Hong Kong, escalated into
near-hysteria when the government estimated that more than 1.6
million people would be eligible for residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that Hong Kong cannot bear the burden of these
1.67 million people,'' said Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's chief
executive, in a typically charged response. ``The consequences are
unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Tung asked Beijing, in effect, to overrule the court
by reinterpreting a part of Hong Kong's constitution that deals
with residency rights. Pro-democracy leaders accuse Tung of
flouting the rule of law, which has been the cornerstone of Hong
Kong's economic success and was supposed to survive the transition
from British to Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   That Hong Kong would put its legal system at risk to keep out an
influx from the mainland shows how vulnerable this enclave still
feels. Nearly two years after Hong Kong reverted to Chinese
sovereignty _ in a grand experiment known as ``one country, two
systems'' _ people here regard Hong Kong as a Xanadu that could be
spoiled by the masses from the vast Chinese hinterland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a typical immigrant mentality that says `I got in, now
close the door behind me,''' said Martin Lee, the leader of Hong
Kong's Democratic Party. ``This whole debate has brought out the
worst in people.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hong Kong's woes, there is no disputing its allure. It
generates a gross domestic product of $25,200 per person, 33 times
that of the rest of China. It has more Rolls-Royces per square mile
than any city in the world. In a country of 1.2 billion people,
half of whom have not made their first phone call, Hong Kong has so
many cellular phones that movie theaters ask patrons not to talk on
them during love scenes.
</P>
<P>
   It may be one country, but measured by almost any economic
yardstick, it remains resolutely two systems.
</P>
<P>
   David Tang, founder of the Shanghai Tang boutiques in Hong Kong
and New York, speaks for many here when he asks: ``Do we want
millions of immigrants coming into a stable and bourgeois society?
Our starting point is different than 150 years ago, when this place
was a barren rock.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has put Hong Kong's residents in an awkward spot.
Most are the children or grandchildren of Chinese refugees who came
in waves after the communist takeover in 1949 or during the
Cultural Revolution. While many still distrust the regime, the
motherland evokes genuine patriotism. Protesters mobbed the U.S.
Consulate here to denounce the errant bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, pelting it with tomatoes rather
than rocks, as protesters did in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to sharing their schools or neighborhoods with
mainland Chinese, Hong Kong's citizens wrinkle their noses. In a
survey of residents conducted shortly after the hand-over in July
1997, the words they most used to describe mainlanders were
``ignorant,'' ``impolite,'' ``dirty'' and ``greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of this has to do with changing demographics. Many of the
mainland Chinese who poured into Hong Kong after 1949 were members
of the commercial elite. Those who came during the Cultural
Revolution tended to be scholars and intellectuals. The latest
batch, from neighboring Guangdong province, are mostly young, male
and uneducated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a form of class discrimination,'' said a 40-year-old
woman from Guangdong province whose husband lives in Hong Kong.
``Many people in China have not had the chance to receive an
education.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who identified herself as Mrs. Siu, is trying to gain
residency for her 16-year-old daughter. Mrs. Siu's husband migrated
to Hong Kong in the 1970s, returning to China in 1981 to find a
wife. After the couple had their daughter, they discovered that
Hong Kong's immigration laws barred her from moving here. So Mrs.
Siu stayed with the daughter in China, while her husband moved
back.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes toward mainland Chinese have also hardened in the wake
of the Asian economic crisis. With Hong Kong limping through its
second year of recession, blue-collar workers here worry that more
newcomers could crowd them out of the job market. Policy-makers
fear that an influx of unskilled people would make Hong Kong less
competitive than Taiwan and Singapore, both of which have
immigration policies that favor highly skilled applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Hong Kong has exaggerated the projected number of
immigrants to scare the public and win support for reversing the
court ruling. ``It's probably the grossest misuse of numbers I've
ever seen by a government,'' said Michael DeGolyer, the director of
an academic project that conducts surveys on public attitudes about
Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
   DeGolyer said some realities of Hong Kong life _ like its
stratospheric real estate prices _ would keep mainlanders away. In
fact, he said, some locals stay only because of its hospitals and
schools. ``If Hong Kong opened its border 24 hours a day,'' he
said, ``and if it built schools and medical facilities near the
border, at least 200,000 people would move out immediately.''

HONG KONG SEEKS ITS OWN CHINESE WALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

<P>
   HONG KONG _ China's newest city is crowded, expensive, polluted
and mired in its worst recession since World War II. Yet to listen
to Hong Kong's leaders, every person in mainland China with the
slightest claim to live here would scramble across the border if
the gates were opened.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Hong Kong has been in a lather over the prospect
that it is about to be inundated by Chinese immigrants. The fears,
which began after a court here granted residency to mainland
Chinese who have at least one parent in Hong Kong, escalated into
near-hysteria when the government estimated that more than 1.6
million people would be eligible for residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that Hong Kong cannot bear the burden of these
1.67 million people,'' said Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's chief
executive, in a typically charged response. ``The consequences are
unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Tung asked Beijing, in effect, to overrule the court
by reinterpreting a part of Hong Kong's constitution that deals
with residency rights. Pro-democracy leaders accuse Tung of
flouting the rule of law, which has been the cornerstone of Hong
Kong's economic success and was supposed to survive the transition
from British to Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   That Hong Kong would put its legal system at risk to keep out an
influx from the mainland shows how vulnerable this enclave still
feels. Nearly two years after Hong Kong reverted to Chinese
sovereignty _ in a grand experiment known as ``one country, two
systems'' _ people here regard Hong Kong as a Xanadu that could be
spoiled by the masses from the vast Chinese hinterland.
</P>
<P>

WOW! A NEW SITCOM ABOUT FIVE SINGLES!

   NEW YORK _ Help! Is there anyone at the television networks
interested in shows for viewers over 35? Is there a world beyond
20-something angst in which roommates in improbably fancy
apartments are obsessed with two quite boring issues, the boys
worried about commitment, the girls looking for Mr. Perfect? Do
viewers really crave more than one show with a happy gay roommate
(a trend since the success of ``Will and Grace,'' a series about a
woman and her gay roommate)?
</P>
<P>
   Are viewers eager to rush to the television this fall and turn
to new sitcoms involving a 34-year-old woman who falls for a
24-year-old room-service waiter or a rich woman who falls for her
super or a 14-year-old boy who is surrounded by his mom, aunt and
three sisters?
</P>
<P>
   Within the last few days in New York City the television
networks have shown snippets of prime-time shows to advertisers and
unveiled their fall schedules. For an outsider wandering in, the
message was unmistakable: Anyone over 35 should forget network
television (with some exceptions, including several new edgy shows
on Fox) and switch to old movies. Or beg HBO to rerun ``The
Sopranos,'' its hit drama about a Mafia don on Prozac, five nights
a week.
</P>
<P>
   What made the annual rite of spring so bleak was the degree of
cynicism and self-satisfaction among television executives and
writer-producers who proudly showed off their newest sitcoms and
seemed in denial over just how terrible they were.
</P>
<P>
   The faint scent of doom in the air _ that of the major networks
watching their audiences erode with the growth of the Internet and
cable _ failed to dampen the strange euphoria among executives at
the fancy parties following each screening.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more bizarre moments in the process of selling
prime-time programming was the odd juxtaposition of news and sitcom
stars. At the ABC event at the New Amsterdam Theater, the
Disney-owned home of ``The Lion King'' (Disney owns ABC), Barbara
Walters, Diane Sawyer and other news personalities were trotted out
and asked about the highlights of their careers. They could have
been the cast of the network's ``Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza
Place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly enjoying center stage, Donaldson intoned, ``I was
tear-gassed in the best places.'' He spoke about John Hinckley's
assassination attempt against President Reagan. ``I hoped he wasn't
shooting at me,'' he said with a shrug. The audience didn't know
whether to laugh or applaud in a Felliniesque moment that fused
journalism with show biz.
</P>
<P>
   No network executives or writer-directors quite matched those at
the WB Network, which prides itself as the only one set up to
appeal entirely to ``12- to 34-year-olds and that's it,'' according
to Jamie Kellner, the WB president. But because the network has
been successful with ``Seventh Heaven'' (which appeals to
families), ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Dawson's Creek,''
there was a heavy dose of preening. One network executive described
WB as ``hip, exciting, cool and fresh,'' adding: ``We know who we
are. We think we know what you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Another WB network executive actually told the crowd of
advertisers and executives of local affiliates to watch WB to find
out how to deal with their children. ``Look at it this way,'' he
said, ``For those of you who can't talk to your kids, at least you
can watch TV'' to find out how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   A writer, Joss Whedon, who created ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,''
which chronicles the adventures of student vampires, was in dead
earnest when he said, ``Buffy is a symbol of empowerment around the
country and beyond.'' How was left unsaid. But Whedon said he
realized ``that there was another story that needed telling.''
</P>
<P>
   That story is ``Angel,'' a new show about a vampire with a
conscience who comes to Los Angeles. `` `Angel' is about
redemption,'' said David Greenwald, the show's executive producer,
using the most popular word in Hollywood among writers and
producers to give meaning to a work that is quite often
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Also about redemption is yet another WB show, ``Popular,'' which
brings together a popular high school cheerleader (blonde, like all
her friends) and an unpopular girl (dark-haired, like all of her
friends) when their single parents become engaged. The show could
have been made by MGM in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   WB seems to be succeeding on this kind of fare. The other
networks are struggling. What was surprising about the sitcoms of
the other networks was not only the tepid quality of so many of
them, but their derivative nature. The success of ``Friends'' (see
above about 20-somethings obsessed with boring issues), has touched
off a tidal wave of other shows about more or less the same people.
</P>
<P>
   There's WB's ``D.C.,'' about five 22-year-olds in Washington
(``In this town no dream comes without a price''); there's ABC's
``Wasteland'' (six friends in the New York dating scene); there's
NBC's ``Cold Feet'' (three young couples) and there's WB's ``Jack &AMP;
Jill'' (``quirky and amusing look at six 20-somethings living in
New York'').
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there a world beyond fake 20-something angst?
</P>
<P>
   Help.

   This is the time of year when high school graduates scrawl happy
and tender sentiments in each other's yearbooks. But nothing so
innocent and uncomplicated could suffice at Columbine High School
in Littleton, Colo., scene of the United States' worst student
shooting rampage a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   With four Columbine seniors, including the two killers, among
those lost to the violence, the school's Class of '99 prepared for
a bittersweet graduation Saturday _ capping a week in which a new
school shooting in Georgia added further urgency to efforts to
control firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, some Columbine seniors had marked their difficult
passage in another way: A teacher, Thomas E. Johnson, had his
senior psychology students write essays on how they had been
affected by the April 20 massacre _ in which two alienated seniors,
Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, killed 12 students and a teacher
before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who submitted essays had survived the rampage by
hiding in the library or an office. Others knew the killers as
classmates in one of Johnson's psychology classes. Others had been
close to one or another victim. Many wrote that their lives had
been profoundly changed. Excerpts follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   From Aaron Welsh:
</P>
<P>
   Before I can go through what I learned from the tragedy at
Columbine High School on April 20, I would like to retrace the
incident. When it started, I was in the library doing homework for
history class. I was at a desk in the middle section when a teacher
came running into the library. She ran behind the main desk and
told us to get under our desks.
</P>
<P>
   While under the desk, I could hear gunshots and explosions in
the commons below the library. ... Very soon after, Eric and Dylan
entered the library. Dylan stopped by the main desk and shot behind
it. I don't know if he was shooting at the phone or the teacher. He
then joined Eric by the computer desks. They started systematically
shooting under desks and laughing about what they had done.
</P>
<P>
   They walked across the section I was in and into the reference
section, where they shot more people under the desks. Eric moved
back to the computer desks to reload his shotgun while Dylan came
up the middle section and walked by the desk I was under. He never
saw me. ...
</P>
<P>
   After the incident, I had time to reflect on what happened. I
realized that I could have been one of the students who didn't make
it out alive. When I realized this, I started to wonder about how I
would be remembered; how friends and family would see my life.
Would they say I lived my life to the fullest ...?
</P>
<P>
   From Janelle Behan:
</P>
<P>
   At first when this happened, people kept telling me that
``Everything happens for a reason.'' That line made me so angry.
How could there ever be a reason for something like this to happen,
and what good could ever come from it? Well, as each day goes by
now, I am seeing more and more good that is coming from it. ...
</P>
<P>
   Some of the good began even before everything was over, while I
still was in the choir office with 60 other students. There were
people I hardly knew who were comforting me, hugging me and telling
me that everything was going to be OK. There was a group of about
six boys who literally saved all of our lives. If it hadn't been
for all of them, none of us would have known what to do. It was
kind of funny, because many of these boys are thought of as goofy
kids in everyday life. But they had taken the panels out of the
ceiling to lift girls through who couldn't breathe, and they kept
all of us quiet so that we couldn't be heard outside. I learned
that many people at school who I thought I really didn't like, I
love them all! ...
</P>
<P>
   From Janna Buchl:
</P>
<P>
   My life style will forever be changed. I am jumpy at certain
things. For instance, I went to Elitch's ((an amusement park)) a
few days ago, and a balloon popped while I was standing in line to
get on the Mind Eraser. I immediately ducked into a fetal position,
covering the back of my neck with my hands. Everyone started to
laugh at me, until I told them that I was a Columbine student. I
felt so stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Other things, even very small things, alarm me more than they
used to. I walk very cautiously down the sidewalks now for no
apparent reason. And I shudder at the sight of guns my father keeps
locked up (for hunting purposes only). ...

   The biggest changes come from my family. My birthday was on
April 25, and the day after, I was planning on moving out of my
house and moving in with my friend. I had everything planned out: I
would get a tattoo and my parents would kick me out. I started to
pack my things on the 19th. When the tragedy happened, I started to
unpack my things. I had decided to stay with the ones who cared
about me the most _ my parents and my sister. They have been with
me every single step of the way _ through the tears and the anger,
and of not knowing if all the people I knew were OK. Now, after
everything that has happened, I do not want to leave, even for
college. I am afraid of what might happen out in the world by
myself.

   From Denise Barrett:
</P>
<P>
   A bunch of friends and I got tattoos recently. All of the girls
except for one got a Columbine flower. Many of them had the words
``CHS 4/20/99'' put on the tattoo. I didn't want that. ... To put
those words on something that symbolized Columbine was to say I
will only remember this day, and I didn't want to be bound only to
something that horrid. I want to see the Columbine flower and
remember all the happy times in high school.
</P>
<P>
   From Patrice Doyle:
</P>
<P>
   I do not believe I will ever understand what those horrible boys
were thinking. That is what bugs me the most, what were they
thinking? This tragedy, though, has taught me many things.
</P>
<P>
   The way I live my life has come into my head many times. Am I
doing the right thing always? Am I making people feel bad by the
way I am treating them? I know joking is a part of life, but I will
never make fun of someone unjokingly again. I hope many kids see,
instead of just hearing about it, how much teasing can hurt a
person.
</P>
<P>
   From Kendra Curry:
</P>
<P>
   I don't care what people think about Eric and Dylan. I forgave
them a long time ago! It's not my place to judge them, only God's
place. ... God does everything for a reason and I know why He did
this. God did this because He wanted us all to wake up and realize
not to judge or hurt other people.

   From Pam Glazner:
</P>
<P>
   In my experience coping with this event thus far, I have
reflected upon my own way of life and decided a few changes are
necessary. I, as a rule, am tense and I tend to forget to enjoy
simple pleasures because I am so busy. I also tend to stress out
and get upset over relatively minute details. Lauren Townsend, my
friend who died in the library at CHS, was a very studious and
hard-working girl, yet she also found time to fit in pleasure,
without stressing herself too much. I hope to learn from her
example, now knowing all too well how quickly life can escape us.
</P>
<P>
   From Rachel Goodwin:
</P>
<P>
   Why Lauren? What did she ever do in her life to deserve such a
fate? Why did this have to happen? Why not me? I remember feeling
pain and sorrow, but not as much as the guilt.
</P>
<P>
   I should have been in the library with them. I should have gone
looking for her to go out to lunch with me. I should have ... What
if ... All the while blaming myself for her death.
</P>
<P>
   Then the funeral. I think that this event was the hardest thing
that I have ever had to do; to bury a best friend, a teammate, a
future roommate, a child cut down before she could even experience
life. Seeing her parents there broke my heart completely in two.
They were so strong, so caring about us and how we were doing. Why
couldn't that strength find me?
</P>
<P>
   I remember our last goodbye to her; our volleyball team had worn
our ribbons to her funeral. Lauren's favorite _ our neon
green-and-blue polka dot ribbons that never gave us the luck we
wished for, but nonetheless were our favorites. During the service,
we all took them out of our hair, went up to her coffin and placed
them on the flowers that adorned the coffin. She was buried with
them. ...
</P>
<P>
   I will forever miss the good times we shared; the fun we had
going to volleyball games in the bus, singing until our faces were
blue, going out to eat at a restaurant and getting in a food fight,
the private and personal inside jokes that we shared, that we would
laugh hysterically at while others looked on, probably thinking,
``What weirdos.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   These memories of Lauren will never leave me. ... I look forward
to the day when I can see her smiling face again, reminisce on old
times, share our inside jokes again, laugh until tears run down our
faces and our cheeks and stomachs hurt, and finally tell her how
much I really love her, now and forever.

   This is the time of year when high school graduates scrawl happy
and tender sentiments in each other's yearbooks. But nothing so
innocent and uncomplicated could suffice at Columbine High School
in Littleton, Colo., scene of the United States' worst student
shooting rampage a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   With four Columbine seniors, including the two killers, among
those lost to the violence, the school's Class of '99 prepared for
a bittersweet graduation Saturday _ capping a week in which a new
school shooting in Georgia added further urgency to efforts to
control firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, some Columbine seniors had marked their difficult
passage in another way: A teacher, Thomas E. Johnson, had his
senior psychology students write essays on how they had been
affected by the April 20 massacre _ in which two alienated seniors,
Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, killed 12 students and a teacher
before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who submitted essays had survived the rampage by
hiding in the library or an office. Others knew the killers as
classmates in one of Johnson's psychology classes. Others had been
close to one or another victim. Many wrote that their lives had
been profoundly changed. Excerpts follow.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   From Aaron Welsh:
</P>
<P>
   Before I can go through what I learned from the tragedy at
Columbine High School on April 20, I would like to retrace the
incident. When it started, I was in the library doing homework for
history class. I was at a desk in the middle section when a teacher
came running into the library. She ran behind the main desk and
told us to get under our desks.
</P>
<P>
   While under the desk, I could hear gunshots and explosions in
the commons below the library. ... Very soon after, Eric and Dylan
entered the library. Dylan stopped by the main desk and shot behind
it. I don't know if he was shooting at the phone or the teacher. He
then joined Eric by the computer desks. They started systematically
shooting under desks and laughing about what they had done.
</P>
<P>
   They walked across the section I was in and into the reference
section, where they shot more people under the desks. Eric moved
back to the computer desks to reload his shotgun while Dylan came
up the middle section and walked by the desk I was under. He never
saw me. ...
</P>
<P>
   After the incident, I had time to reflect on what happened. I
realized that I could have been one of the students who didn't make
it out alive. When I realized this, I started to wonder about how I
would be remembered; how friends and family would see my life.
Would they say I lived my life to the fullest ...?
</P>
<P>
   From Janelle Behan:
</P>
<P>
   At first when this happened, people kept telling me that
``Everything happens for a reason.'' That line made me so angry.
How could there ever be a reason for something like this to happen,
and what good could ever come from it? Well, as each day goes by
now, I am seeing more and more good that is coming from it. ...
</P>
<P>
   Some of the good began even before everything was over, while I
still was in the choir office with 60 other students. There were
people I hardly knew who were comforting me, hugging me and telling
me that everything was going to be OK. There was a group of about
six boys who literally saved all of our lives. If it hadn't been
for all of them, none of us would have known what to do. It was
kind of funny, because many of these boys are thought of as goofy
kids in everyday life. But they had taken the panels out of the
ceiling to lift girls through who couldn't breathe, and they kept
all of us quiet so that we couldn't be heard outside. I learned
that many people at school who I thought I really didn't like, I
love them all! ...
</P>
<P>
   From Janna Buchl:
</P>
<P>
   My life style will forever be changed. I am jumpy at certain
things. For instance, I went to Elitch's ((an amusement park)) a
few days ago, and a balloon popped while I was standing in line to
get on the Mind Eraser. I immediately ducked into a fetal position,
covering the back of my neck with my hands. Everyone started to
laugh at me, until I told them that I was a Columbine student. I
felt so stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Other things, even very small things, alarm me more than they
used to. I walk very cautiously down the sidewalks now for no
apparent reason. And I shudder at the sight of guns my father keeps
locked up (for hunting purposes only). ...
</P>
<P>
   The biggest changes come from my family. My birthday was on

AS BOMBING CONTINUES, DEFIANCE GIVES WAY TO GRIM RESIGNATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ A few days ago, the outdoor cafes in the Skadarlija
section of the Yugoslav capital were teeming with patrons, as
Belgrade residents sipped beer and soaked up the late afternoon
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Without warning, there was a huge explosion nearby, a thud that
jerked conversation to a sudden halt. But only briefly. People
paused for a few seconds, looked at each other, then turned back to
their conversations. In the beer garden of the BiP brewery, none of
the two dozen patrons got up to leave.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's air campaign enters its third month, the constant
bombardment of this capital has left its 2 million residents more
than war-weary. They are literally weary. Sleep deprivation is one
of the biggest byproducts of the bombing of Belgrade. Virtually
everyone complains of not having slept soundly since the bombing
began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The exuberant defiance shown in outdoor rallies in the early
days of the bombing has been replaced by something more like groggy
resignation that the war, and the widespread inconvenience and
occasional violent death that goes along with it, will continue
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain routine and normality to the days, while
nights are almost always accompanied by wailing air raid sirens,
the hum of NATO warplanes overhead, and the booms of missiles,
striking in and around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from some isolated staples, such as sugar and cooking oil,
there are no obvious food shortages. Buses and trolleys run, and
they are always full, though more than half of the population is
out of work. People wait in line for hours to buy cigarettes, while
impatient or desperate smokers pay double or triple prices on the
black market. Gas is being rationed, but plenty is available on the
black market for those willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the people of Sarajevo, who lost their electricity and
water for years, people in Belgrade so far have not had to put up
with the sort of maddening inconvenience that others in the Balkans
have had to endure for parts of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   There is an unsettling unpredictability about the war. After
nearly two weeks of relative calm that followed NATO's mistaken
bombing of the Chinese Embassy, nightly bombing resumed last
Tuesday, and some of the heaviest bombing of the last two months
occurred Wednesday night into Thursday morning. On Saturday, NATO
said it had flown the most sorties in any 24-hour period, and vowed
to increase them.
</P>
<P>
   Few people here now believe it's going to get better before it
gets worse. There were widespread blackouts over the weekend. The
inconvenience factor may be about to be racheted up considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Residents say the bomb shelters are less crowded these days than
when the bombing first began _ not because there is any less
bombing, but because more people have decided to take their chances
in the comfort of their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Balabanic does a mean impression of a cruise missile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weeeee-oooooooo, boom!'' says the 73-year-old woman. She says
her nerves are shot, that she fears that the missiles that struck
the police building just a block from her home will one day come
through her wall. That isn't enough to get her to leave her
9th-floor apartment for the bomb shelter in her basement. After a
few sleepless nights in the basement, she swore off shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Veljko, also 73, agrees, saying he would rather die
in his bed than endure the claustrophobic cacophony of the shelter.
For him, suffering is relative. As a 17-year-old partisan, he was
captured and held in a concentration camp for nearly two years by
the Nazis' Croatian collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the fear is bigger than the rational thinking, then you go
to the bomb shelter,'' he explains, sitting in his living room,
strains of Marvin Gaye's ``What's Going On'' coming from the
stereo. ``Right now, rationally, I don't want to go to the bomb
shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Balabanics, like tens of thousands of Belgrade residents,
take the odds that their homes won't be hit by stray NATO missiles.
The strategy is not without risk. Every one here mentions a
3-year-old girl killed in one of the early raids. On Thursday, a
missile fell 500 yards short of its target, a military complex,
flattening a hospital neurological unit and killing at least four
people.
</P>
<P>
   But if staying in one's apartment is better than trying to get a
night's sleep in a bomb shelter, it is only marginally better.
Sladana Topalovic, a dentist, said she has never felt more tired in
her life. She said that when she gets up in the morning she feels
as if she has closed her eyes but not slept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels like this, it's not just me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If Belgrade residents think they have it bad, there are some who
believe they don't have it bad enough. Some NATO commanders want to
cut off electricity and water, in hopes of stirring resistance to
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few people here expect a public uprising, or for
Milosevic to sacrifice himself for a settlement. As NATO turns the
screws, ordinary people voice anger at NATO, not Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But judging dissent here is difficult. Police, many of them in
plainclothes, are everywhere. After opposition party leaders
suggested Milosevic cut a deal with NATO, their offices were
vandalized by mobs as police looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Like many who have relatives in the countryside, Joca Dokoc sent
his wife and 7-year-old son to a rural area last month. Without
telling him in advance, they returned on Wednesday, just in time
for the heaviest bombing, including the first bombs that fell in
their neighborhood, aimed at nearby fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is very frightened,'' says Dokoc. ``He said, `Can I
sleep in your bed?' I said, `OK for tonight. Tomorrow, you go back
to the country.' ''

NEW FASHIONS   AMID OLD FEUDS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ In heart of the city, pounding with a disco
beat, the party was in full swing on a recent weekend night.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes away by car, meanwhile, busload after busload of
newly arrived ethnic Albanians were settling down for their first
night in the tents that were now their homes. Blankets were
distributed. Rain was forecast.
</P>
<P>
   But downtown life went on, and life was good. For many of the
weekend partiers, dancing at nightclubs, enjoying ice cream sundaes
at one of the cafes in the mall, the Kosovar refugees were out of
sight, out of mind. Mention of them brought grimaces. Mention of
NATO brought groans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People did stay inside the first night of the NATO airstrikes
because we were all scared,'' said Ljupco Atanasov, a 25-year-old
unemployed engineer who was on a double date. ``We are scared now,
too _ that the refugees will stay in our country, that NATO will
keep making war on Yugoslavia from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Added his friend, college economics major George Alexov, also
25: ``NATO has no job here. It's Kosovo where they should be. We
can keep our own security.''
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds and sometimes thousands more Kosovars arriving
daily and the United States advocating a rapid buildup of NATO
troops in Macedonia, many of the young adults who live in Skopje
and who largely seem unable to find jobs here said over the weekend
that they feel attacked on all fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Hot spots in the capital city, cosmopolitan by Balkan standards
despite the bland, Communist-era architecture, were crowded with
people wearing up-to-date designer knockoffs but holding to
centuries-old feuds.
</P>
<P>
   Young people sat at cafe tables jammed close together, or stood
in lines outside bars blaring music from the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Few whose families were not originally from Albania expressed
anything but contempt for the 50 or so Kosovar women who have given
birth in a nearby refugee camp. Images of Kosovar children
separated from their parents seemed not to move them. All but a
handful refused to condemn the ethnic cleansing campaign by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, instead blaming Western
forces and the refugees themselves for amassing in Macedonia at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Milosevic is a good man who maybe did a bad thing, but
Serbian babies are dying, too . . .,'' said Elena Markovska, a
15-year-old high school student who was out at midnight eating
sweets with three girlfriends. ``We like the American people very
much. We like their ways. But we don't think what they're doing
here is right. It won't help anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with NATO's commander, General Wesley Clark, calling for
the military alliance to assemble as many as 50,000 troops on
Kosovo's borders _ almost double the previously agreed number _
that sort of angry talk from even teenagers is threatening to
disrupt Macedonia's delicate ethnic balance and to create an
anti-American backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Before ethnic Albanians started streaming across the border,
before the North Atlantic Treaty Organization began its air
campaign eight weeks ago, Macedonia was a nascent and divided
Balkan democracy. Overwhelmingly Slavic, 23 percent of its
population is Albanian by heritage, with a variety of ethnic
backgrounds making up another 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jakub Ramushi, an ethnic Albanian translator who speaks a
half-dozen languages but was unable to find work until the latest
crisis brought scores of journalists and relief workers to town,
went so far as to compare the majority's treatment of the minority
to the pre-civil rights era in the US South. He said he favors both
a NATO buildup and its bombing campaign, as well as the ground war
which President Clinton has yet to rule out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can really make you feel bad for being Albanian,'' said
Ramushi, 27, who was born in Skopje after his parents moved to the
capital from Kosovo. He emphasized that he considers himself as
much Macedonian as Albanian. ``We did get a lot more rights after
Macedonia became independent _ high school in our own language, an
Albanian university _ but the ones who didn't like us before like
us less now that all of this is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments by more than two dozen Macedonians around the same age
would seem to bear out his concerns. Sasha Milosevic, no relation
to the Yugoslav leader, called Macedonians brothers of the Serbs,
enemies of the Albanians. The 27-year-old government security
worker added that NATO is now on the way to becoming his enemy,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not good to have so many soldiers here,'' said Gordana
Trajkoska, 30, who works part-time jobs when she can find them.
``You can notice them during the day and the night. It is an
internal problem in Yugoslavia, and it is not good for some outside
force to try to do something. Every country has its problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But Errol Khazovic, a 21-year-old Bosnian store clerk now living
in Macedonia, said that NATO's presence made him feel safer, and
that he would welcome more troops to his adopted country if it
would lead to peace. ``It's for our protection and the protection
of Macedonia, for every people, all of the Balkans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed buildup in both Albania and Macedonia, which not
all NATO allies endorse, is intended in part to pressure Milosevic
into accepting NATO's settlement terms. But as a condition for any
settlement, Yugoslavia on Friday called on NATO to cease its
airstrikes and to withdraw troops already stationed on the borders
of neighboring countries.
</P>

   ``It's not a good thing to have these NATO troops and I don't
want them here,'' said waitress Tanya Lazarevska, 22, preparing to
serve another round of beers at a downtown bar serving desserts as
well as drinks. ``What does this have to do with us? I don't know
anyone who is happy about it.''

REPORT DETAILS PSYCHOLOGICAL TOLL OF ULSTER VIOLENCE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ The standard way of taking the toll of the
``Troubles'' here is to cite the more than 3,000 killed and 40,000
wounded in 30 years of clashes between Protestants and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   But an equally disturbing measure of what has been lost is due
out this week. The first report to analyze the psychological legacy
of the conflict describes residents of violence-ridden
neighborhoods who suffer nightmares and flashbacks, who feel guilty
for living when relatives have perished, who take drugs and drink
to numb the ache, and who are certain that nothing and no one can
help heal their emotional scars.
</P>
<P>
   Coming as negotiations over self-government are entering a
make-or-break phase, the study helps to explain why all of Northern
Ireland seems to be in a nail-biting state of anxiety over whether
the stalled peace process can be reenergized _ and whether
psychological as well as physical recovery can commence in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our report suggests is first of all that the impact of
the armed conflict is long-term,'' said Marie Smyth, director of
the Cost of the Troubles Study, the charitable organization that
conducted the analysis. It is to be made public Thursday and is the
last in a series of reports on the violence here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In physical terms it's very clear that if someone has a leg
blown off in an explosion, clearly the leg will not grow back,''
Smyth added. ``But in emotional terms, while some people have been
able to make some kind of recovery, there are a significant number
who have not . . . 20 years later they're still living with the
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Close knows all about the impact of sectarian violence
that has been widespread here since 1969. It claimed her husband 16
years ago. Since then one nephew has been shot, while another was
beaten and later died. Her brother-in-law was killed and her
brother still has the bullet in his brain from another shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has come through without being scarred,'' Close said.
``For people like us it's too late for help. We're getting on with
our lives the best we know how.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, have been asking for help, especially since the
cease-fires in 1994 and the Good Friday Agreement of last year.
Much the way soldiers who fought in Vietnam and World War II held
in the hurt until the fighting ended, mental health workers say,
many touched by the violence here responded to its cessation by
acknowledging their pain and seeking counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Their problems fall into four general groups, the therapists
say: a nervousness, or ``hyperarousal,'' that makes them sense
danger even when it is not there; avoidance that keeps them away
from certain parts of the city and that often leaves them
housebound; flashbacks and other ruminations about violent episodes
they witnessed; and a ``dissociation'' that leaves them numb to
nearly everything around them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the problems affected a single individual; more often
they touched an entire family, leading to a surge in spousal abuse
and other home-centered troubles. Sometimes it was adults who were
stricken, but often it was children, many under 13, who felt they
somehow were responsible for violence that killed or wounded a
parent or sibling.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the psychological troubles have been described mainly
through anecdotal experience _ with nearly everyone here able to
offer a new and disturbing twist _ or through case files of health
care workers. But the study to be released this week, based on a
survey of 1,346 adults across the country, offers the first
in-depth look at what is wrong and what could be done.
</P>
<P>
   One in four respondents from neighborhoods where
Troubles-related deaths were highest reported having nightmares,
compared with one in eight in neighborhoods where the frequency of
deaths was more moderate. Likewise, the rates at which people
experienced disturbing flashbacks, or felt guilty for having
survived the violence, was nearly three times as high in the
high-violence areas.
</P>
<P>
   What did they do to deal with their guilt and other woes? One in
four who lived in high-violence areas took some form of medication
to help, while almost as many said they were drinking more alcohol.
And when they sought counseling, 40 percent of those living in
these areas said they couldn't find it, compared with 29 percent in
neighborhoods with moderate or little violence.
</P>
<P>
   The most disturbing finding of all involved despair:
Eighty-three percent of those in high-violence areas said they felt
nothing could help them, compared with just 4 percent in areas with
moderate violence and 12 percent in places with few killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``On every single count, areas of high intensity violence show a
quantum difference. It's like you're talking about two different
countries,'' said Smyth, an adjunct professor at Smith College in
Massachusetts. She and her colleagues are calling for government
policies that target assistance to the worst-hit neighborhoods,
recognize the critical role the family plays in providing support,
and address the way in which drugs and alcohol are easy fixes for
so many victims.
</P>
<P>
   Therapists and others dealing with such matters say change
already is happening, especially since the flood of new cases began
several years ago and since more funds became available as a result
of the April 1998 peace agreement. They're hopeful even more will
happen if Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain succeeds in bringing
the various parties together in ongoing talks that focus on
power-sharing arrangements for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   More funds are being spent, victims have a more effective voice,
and a government minister has been made responsible for handling
trauma-related health issues, says Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, who
served as Northern Ireland's Victims Commissioner and produced a
mammoth report on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a long time for this society to work a lot of
this out of our system,'' he added, ``but at least a start is being
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Healey also is hopeful, especially since her new Family
Trauma Center opened in March with funds from the Good Friday
Agreement. ``I think we needed a culture of denial to be able to
cope,'' she said, but now people are beginning to come forward,
acknowledge their psychological problems, and seek treatment
ranging from individual counseling to family therapy.
</P>
<P>
   While many of her patients suffer syndromes that look like the
post-traumatic stress experienced by Vietnam veterans, Healey
added, ``there's nothing `post' about our situation. It's much more
like South Africa, where's there a continuous traumatic stress
disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are less sanguine about the help professional counselors
can offer, and less confident that victims of violence will seek
that assistance. That is why Close and people like her formed
Survivors of Trauma, a group through which victims of violence help
one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's people who have been there,'' she said. ``It isn't
bringing in counselors who have never been through it.''

`STAR WARS' ROCKETS INTO BOX-OFFICE HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bar has been set high, very high, and America has been
waiting with bated breath. Will ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace,'' the most-hyped movie in history, set a box-office
record during its five-day opening? Will it sink ``Titanic?'' Will
it stomp ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, according to estimates given by Tom Sherak, chairman of
20th Century Fox's domestic film group, the movie's distributor.
Its total gross from last Wednesday through Sunday at 1 p.m.
anyway, was estimated at $102.8 million. Figures are usually
calculated over a three-day period, or four days if a Monday
holiday is involved. Sherak said ``Titanic'' grossed $28 million on
its first weekend and perhaps a total of $40 million over its first
five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' which set an
opening day record by bringing in $28.5 million, grossed an
estimated $61.8 million over its first weekend, the largest figure
for a non-holiday opening. (The holiday champ is ``The Lost World:
Jurassic Park,'' which opened Memorial Day weekend two years ago
and took in $72 million.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' is showing at 2,970 theaters _ many of
them featuring it on multiple screens _ across the country, and has
averaged $20,819 per location. It has become the fastest movie to
reach the $100 million mark (five days, vs. six days for ``Lost
World'').
</P>
<P>
   Is everyone happy?
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is we're always happy,'' responds Sherak. The
better news is this is the good side of the force. We're thrilled.
Next weekend, the holiday, it will be like a shooting star: You
just hold onto it.''
</P>
<P>
   This prediction, of course, comes amid critical reaction which,
by and large, has rated the movie somewhere between tepid and
plot-free to barely adequate. On May 16, Washington Post writer
Tony Kornheiser predicted, ``By this time next week the crowds are
going to be so meager that if you want to see this piece of junk,
George Lucas will drive you personally. Nobody is going to see this
. . . This puppy stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   But the crowds are out there. This one seems to be critic-proof.
``That's the one great thing about the movie business,'' says
Sherak. ``Everyone has an opinion, and nobody's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas's three other ``Star Wars'' movies are in the all-time
top-10 grossing movies. ``It's not a contest,'' George Lucas told
Newsday recently. ``I really don't have any desire to be No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is.
</P>
<P>
   Movie analysts have predicted a total gross when all is said and
done of between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion worldwide in
theaters. ``Titanic'' grossed $600.8 million in the US, and $1.01
billion worldwide.

SECULAR JEWS FEAR ULTRA-ORTHODOX POWER SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Down the streets of the insular world of Israel's
ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods, men in traditional black coats
and wide-brimmed hats glare with suspicion at outsiders. Young boys
and girls stare blankly before their mothers herd them inside their
homes, away from the strangers.
</P>
<P>
   They are known as the ``haredim,'' or ``God fearing.''
</P>
<P>
   But after capturing many more seats in parliament in Monday's
general election, the haredim are the ones instilling fear in many
Israelis. Especially the majority who want Israel to be first and
foremost a secular democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, who was handed a landslide
victory, begins to form his government this week. And Barak may
consider inviting the ultra-Orthodox party Shas, or perhaps one of
the other religious parties, into his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts say that if Barak invites the
ultra-Orthodox in, he runs the risk of alienating the secular left
wing that worked hard to get him elected. Other observers say the
power of the ultra-Orthodox, and particularly Shas, has become so
overwhelming it can't be ignored if Barak wants to effectively
govern.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, a ``haredi'' movement that represents mostly first- and
second-generation immigrants from North Africa and the greater
Middle East, captured 17 seats in Israel's 120-member parliament.
By picking up seven seats, Shas, a Hebrew acronym for Sephardic
Guardians of the Torah, consolidated its place as the third-largest
party in Israel and reached a political parity with the
conservative Likud Party, which plunged to only 19 seats from the
32 it had before the elections.
</P>
<P>
   The secular left parties also scored big victories and many
secular voters, even those from the political right, said they
voted for Barak's left-of-center One Israel list because they
thought it would contain ultra-Orthodox influence in politics. So
the results of the election revealed a deepening of the
religious-secular divide. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Religious law &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political haredim are Jewish fundamentalists who
overwhelmingly support the implementation of ``halacha,'' or Jewish
religious law.
</P>
<P>
   The growing power of the haredim has also made many American
Jews, whether secular, Conservative, or Reform, uneasy about the
direction they think the haredim are trying to take a nation to
which they have strong ties.
</P>
<P>
   Since Zionism began a century ago, the underlying question has
been whether a Jewish state would define itself as a democracy or a
theocracy. The rise of the haredim has given the question new
urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Rosenblum, 43, a Yale Law School graduate who grew up
in a traditional Jewish home in suburban Chicago, is a member of
the haredim and writes a column for the Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shas is a reflection of traditional Jews returning to a more
intense religious experience,'' he said. ``There is a fear among
seculars, a terror of the haredim that vastly exaggerates our
political influence. It is a form of bigotry, plain and simple.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
High birthrate &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fear is brought on by a sense that Israel, especially
Jerusalem, has become overrun by the ultra-Orthodox. The haredim
have an average of seven children per family. More than 50 percent
of children in Jerusalem, and about 25 percent across Israel,
attend haredi schools.
</P>
<P>
   The community is a significant drain on the Israeli economy. The
unemployment rate among Haredi men is an estimated 60 percent
because so many are enrolled in yeshivas, or religious seminaries.
The number of yeshiva students has surged from 35,000 in 1990 to
almost 80,000 today, and the black-clad ultra-Orthodox young men
leafing through Talmudic texts and praying in a rhythmic
back-and-forth movement seem ubiquitous in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The army of yeshiva students has given Israel a higher rate of
nonparticipation in the adult male workforce than any other country
in the developed world, according to one study. They receive
welfare, tax exemptions, national insurance, and stipends for books
and are given a blanket draft deferment while they study. This has
caused seething resentment in a nation where the economy is
faltering and where a selfless devotion to mandatory military
service is a point of pride. One of Barak's most resonant campaign
themes was to put an end to the blanket deferments and force the
students to carry out some form of national service. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Political power &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof is a manifestation of the
religious zeal, the factionalism, the mysticism, and the raw
political power of the ultra-Orthodox community. A swath of modern
symmetrical apartment buildings built of white stone, the community
overlooks the sprawling, ancient Jewish cemeteries on the Mount of
Olives outside the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Here lives the spiritual leader of Shas, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, as
does Aryeh Deri, who stepped down as the group's political leader
after the election. Deri can be compared to America's populist,
immigrant political bosses _ playing off ethnic resentment,
religious affiliation, and the suffering of the underclass, in this
case to gain influence for the Jewish migrants from North Africa
and the Arab world known as the Sephardim.
</P>
<P>
   In Benjamin Netanyahu's outgoing governing coalition, Deri was
particularly skillfull at channeling funding to Sephardic housing,
to educational institutions and health care clinics in
disenfranchised Sephardic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   And like many old school political bosses, Deri has run into
trouble with the law. Deri was convicted of corruption, bribery,
and fraud and sentenced last month to four years in prison. He is
awaiting appeal, but has lashed out at Israel's judicial system,
saying it is controlled by the secular, Ashkenazi elite of European
Jews, who want to keep him from empowering the Sephardim.
</P>
<P>
   On land issues, the ultra-Orthodox, especially Shas, are more
pliable than the ultranationalists, who are also religious. But the
ultra-Orthodox are just as rigid on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Arazi Cohen, 39, of Moroccan ancestry, a Yeshiva student, was
carrying thick, leather-bound volumes of Talmudic interpretations
under his arm, excited about the success of Shas in the recent
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of this nation wants Judaism, more Jewish life.
This country should be established with religious laws,'' said
Cohen, reflecting the messianic fervor among the ultra-Orthodox who
believe Israel is destined to become a theocratic state. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Culture war &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the religious-secular divide in Israel is a
culture war between Jerusalem, where the haredi are thriving, and
Tel Aviv, the heart of Israel's secular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Haredim are casually referred to by secular Israelis as ``the
blacks,'' a comment on the color of the men's clothing, but many
religious people believe it is said with derision and an underlying
bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   But the haredim, too, have a lexicon of hatred, referring to the
nonreligious as ``the Messiah's donkeys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sefi Rachlevski, author of a nonfiction book titled ``Messiah's
Donkey,'' said, ``More and more secular Israelis feel they are
losing the identity of Israel. They feel they have become donkeys
for a dream of the messianic ultra-Orthodox, and for the settler
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this election,'' Rachlevski said, ``the donkeys said,
`Enough is enough.' ''

MEMOIR'S SPY CHARGES SPUR DEBATE AMONG SCIENTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It was supposed to be a kind of detective
story, the clever unmasking of the identity of a former Manhattan
Project scientist who may have passed atomic secrets to the Soviets
during World War II. Instead, it has turned into an acrimonious
battle to preserve the reputation of one of the nation's most
revered scientists, MIT's Philip Morrison, after charges of
espionage were leveled against him by a respected public-interest
activist and author.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the story especially odd and poignant is that the two
men were longtime friends. They are unlikely to be again.
</P>
<P>
   The story exploded with the publication last month of a memoir
by Jeremy Stone, son of the crusading independent reporter I.F.
Stone and, for the last 30 years, president of the Federation of
American Scientists. In the book's next-to-last chapter, he details
a series of conversations and visits with a scientist he calls
Scientist X, who he comes to believe was a Soviet spy, code-named
Perseus.
</P>
<P>
   But Scientist X was easily identified as the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's Morrison, who then sent Stone a letter
detailing clear-cut discrepancies that show he could not have been
Perseus. Stone responded with a terse letter acknowledging the
discrepancies, and saying that ``I can only accept your denial that
you are Perseus.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Stone's failure to apologize for his allegations or to
change the book, some members of the federation are debating
whether stronger remedies may be appropriate. Documents summarizing
the tale were sent to members of the federation's governing board
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just outraged'' by the unsubstantiated charges in
Stone's book ``Every Man Should Try,'' said Priscilla McMillan, a
professor at Harvard University's Russian Research Center and
secretary of the federation. Despite Stone's attempts to conceal
Morrison's identity, she said, ``anybody who knew anything about
the history of the Manhattan Project would know who it was.''
</P>
<P>
   While both men are held in high regard, several scientists and
historians contacted by the Globe who know them both expressed
dismay at Stone's actions and unreserved support for Morrison. ``I
think Phil is unscathed by this,'' said Frank von Hippel, chairman
of the federation's nonprofit foundation.
</P>
<P>
   As for Stone, von Hippel said, ``some people would like him to
apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   It began with the 1991 publication of a series of articles by
Colonel Vladimir Chikov, and then a 1994 book by Pavel Sudoplatov,
both former KGB officials who mentioned Perseus as having been one
of a half-dozen scientists who they claim provided secret
information about the development of the atomic bomb to Soviet
agents during the war.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there were obvious discrepancies between Morrison and
the Perseus described by Chikov, making it clear that Morrison
could not have been that spy _ if, indeed, such a person ever
existed.
</P>
<P>
   But if Perseus was real, the articles make it clear that
Morrison was not the one. They refer to Perseus having been
recruited by the KGB during a visit to his ill parents in New York,
whereas Morrison's parents lived in Philadelphia at the time. And
they say that Perseus was fighting with the International Brigades
in Spain, whereas Morrison, as he pointed out in his letter to
Stone, ``was never plausible infantry material.'' Morrison,
stricken with polio as a child, always walked with a severe limp
and a cane.
</P>
<P>
   If the discrepancies were so clear, what led Stone to make his
identification in the first place? It all appears to have been
based on a turn of phrase and on interpretations of body language.
</P>
<P>
   The first clue, Stone says in his book, was a few sentences
attributed to Perseus in the Chikov article, describing his
motivations for providing atomic information to Russia. Unlike more
recent spy cases, there was no financial motive here; Perseus
apparently believed that for the United States alone to have the
bomb would be a dangerous and unstable situation, and that it was
important for the Soviet Union to join the nuclear club as quickly
as possible to restore a balance of power. Stone thought the
sentiments and one particular phrase sounded like the voice of his
friend Morrison _ even though, as he acknowledged, the quote had
been translated from English to Russian and back again and then
edited.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison not only denies the identification, he strongly eschews
the sentiments ascribed to the wartime Perseus. ``No, I didn't feel
that way,'' he said in an interview Friday. ``I think it's simply
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting this hunch that Perseus might be Morrison, Stone
recounts that in 1994, he visited Morrison and his wife twice to
try to sound them out. But, as he makes clear in the book, he never
actually stated what was on his mind, instead talking in broad
terms about Perseus and about trying to get that person to tell his
story.
</P>
<P>
   In those meetings, Stone says Morrison became so fearful that
his knees shook, and that Phylis Morrison's reactions seemed to
confirm his suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to written questions from the Globe, Stone
summarized his reasons for going ahead: ``The chapter was written
only because, in conjunction with everything else . . . during a
discussion of Perseus between myself and the Morrisons, Phylis
seemed to have actually identified Phil as Perseus by throwing a
fit, pointing at him, and urging me to reach a `tacit agreement'
with him while he sat there silently. I felt entrapped by this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morrison says that in pointing to him during that
conversation, Phylis was merely recognizing and reacting to the
still-unstated accusation by Stone against Morrison. And the
recalled quote is simply wrong, he says. The shaking knees,
Morrison said, were the result of aftereffects of his childhood
polio.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Morrison has been a long-term member of the
federation that Stone heads, and was instrumental not only in
hiring him, but in heading off an attempt to oust Stone from that
position years ago _ all of which Stone acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his written responses, Stone says that ``I have
always loved and admired Philip Morrison . . .'' His goal, he says,
is to persuade those people who participated in wartime espionage
to come forward and share their stories, in the interests of
history and to allow Americans to judge their motives for
themselves. And he acknowledges that ``it is entirely possible that
Perseus does not exist at all,'' and that ``obviously, Phil may
well be innocent of any violation of law whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether such statements will be enough to stave
off any attempt by the federation's board to demand further
response. Robert Park, a physicist and director of the American
Physical Society, although not a federation member, said he has
spoken with some members and that ``if there has not been already,
I would be astonished if there were not calls for his
resignation.'' In the meantime, he said, some members have already
talked about resigning in protest.

MEMOIR'S SPY CHARGES SPUR DEBATE AMONG SCIENTISTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It was supposed to be a kind of detective
story, the clever unmasking of the identity of a former Manhattan
Project scientist who may have passed atomic secrets to the Soviets
during World War II. Instead, it has turned into an acrimonious
battle to preserve the reputation of one of the nation's most
revered scientists, MIT's Philip Morrison, after charges of
espionage were leveled against him by a respected public-interest
activist and author.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the story especially odd and poignant is that the two
men were longtime friends. They are unlikely to be again.
</P>
<P>
   The story exploded with the publication last month of a memoir
by Jeremy Stone, son of the crusading independent reporter I.F.
Stone and, for the last 30 years, president of the Federation of
American Scientists. In the book's next-to-last chapter, he details
a series of conversations and visits with a scientist he calls
Scientist X, who he comes to believe was a Soviet spy, code-named
Perseus.
</P>
<P>
   But Scientist X was easily identified as the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's Morrison, who then sent Stone a letter
detailing clear-cut discrepancies that show he could not have been
Perseus. Stone responded with a terse letter acknowledging the
discrepancies, and saying that ``I can only accept your denial that
you are Perseus.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Stone's failure to apologize for his allegations or to
change the book, some members of the federation are debating
whether stronger remedies may be appropriate. Documents summarizing
the tale were sent to members of the federation's governing board
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just outraged'' by the unsubstantiated charges in
Stone's book ``Every Man Should Try,'' said Priscilla McMillan, a
professor at Harvard University's Russian Research Center and
secretary of the federation. Despite Stone's attempts to conceal
Morrison's identity, she said, ``anybody who knew anything about
the history of the Manhattan Project would know who it was.''
</P>
<P>
   While both men are held in high regard, several scientists and
historians contacted by the Globe who know them both expressed
dismay at Stone's actions and unreserved support for Morrison. ``I
think Phil is unscathed by this,'' said Frank von Hippel, chairman
of the federation's nonprofit foundation.
</P>
<P>
   As for Stone, von Hippel said, ``some people would like him to
apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   It began with the 1991 publication of a series of articles by
Colonel Vladimir Chikov, and then a 1994 book by Pavel Sudoplatov,
both former KGB officials who mentioned Perseus as having been one
of a half-dozen scientists who they claim provided secret
information about the development of the atomic bomb to Soviet
agents during the war.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there were obvious discrepancies between Morrison and
the Perseus described by Chikov, making it clear that Morrison
could not have been that spy _ if, indeed, such a person ever
existed.
</P>
<P>
   But if Perseus was real, the articles make it clear that
Morrison was not the one. They refer to Perseus having been
recruited by the KGB during a visit to his ill parents in New York,
whereas Morrison's parents lived in Philadelphia at the time. And
they say that Perseus was fighting with the International Brigades
in Spain, whereas Morrison, as he pointed out in his letter to
Stone, ``was never plausible infantry material.'' Morrison,
stricken with polio as a child, always walked with a severe limp
and a cane.
</P>
<P>
   If the discrepancies were so clear, what led Stone to make his
identification in the first place? It all appears to have been
based on a turn of phrase and on interpretations of body language.
</P>
<P>
   The first clue, Stone says in his book, was a few sentences
attributed to Perseus in the Chikov article, describing his
motivations for providing atomic information to Russia. Unlike more
recent spy cases, there was no financial motive here; Perseus
apparently believed that for the United States alone to have the
bomb would be a dangerous and unstable situation, and that it was
important for the Soviet Union to join the nuclear club as quickly
as possible to restore a balance of power. Stone thought the
sentiments and one particular phrase sounded like the voice of his
friend Morrison _ even though, as he acknowledged, the quote had
been translated from English to Russian and back again and then
edited.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison not only denies the identification, he strongly eschews
the sentiments ascribed to the wartime Perseus. ``No, I didn't feel
that way,'' he said in an interview Friday. ``I think it's simply
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting this hunch that Perseus might be Morrison, Stone
recounts that in 1994, he visited Morrison and his wife twice to
try to sound them out. But, as he makes clear in the book, he never
actually stated what was on his mind, instead talking in broad
terms about Perseus and about trying to get that person to tell his
story.
</P>
<P>
   In those meetings, Stone says Morrison became so fearful that
his knees shook, and that Phylis Morrison's reactions seemed to
confirm his suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to written questions from the Globe, Stone
summarized his reasons for going ahead: ``The chapter was written
only because, in conjunction with everything else . . . during a
discussion of Perseus between myself and the Morrisons, Phylis
seemed to have actually identified Phil as Perseus by throwing a
fit, pointing at him, and urging me to reach a `tacit agreement'
with him while he sat there silently. I felt entrapped by this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morrison says that in pointing to him during that
conversation, Phylis was merely recognizing and reacting to the
still-unstated accusation by Stone against Morrison. And the
recalled quote is simply wrong, he says. The shaking knees,
Morrison said, were the result of aftereffects of his childhood
polio.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Morrison has been a long-term member of the
federation that Stone heads, and was instrumental not only in
hiring him, but in heading off an attempt to oust Stone from that
position years ago _ all of which Stone acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his written responses, Stone says that ``I have
always loved and admired Philip Morrison . . .'' His goal, he says,
is to persuade those people who participated in wartime espionage
to come forward and share their stories, in the interests of
history and to allow Americans to judge their motives for
themselves. And he acknowledges that ``it is entirely possible that
Perseus does not exist at all,'' and that ``obviously, Phil may
well be innocent of any violation of law whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether such statements will be enough to stave
off any attempt by the federation's board to demand further
response. Robert Park, a physicist and director of the American
Physical Society, although not a federation member, said he has
spoken with some members and that ``if there has not been already,
I would be astonished if there were not calls for his
resignation.'' In the meantime, he said, some members have already
talked about resigning in protest.

   Last December, armed rebels captured a group of U.S. Marines and
held them hostage in a makeshift compound. Nearby, terrorist gunmen
hid among local civilians, waiting for the arrival of additional
American forces. The situation seemed headed for a stalemate until
a second group of Marines showed up bearing exotic weapons that
disabled the enemy soldiers without killing them. The weapons
included microwave guns, sonic cannons, and disorienting laser
strobes. The savior Marines stormed the compound without bloodshed,
rescued their comrades and escaped with minor casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The battle? A field exercise at a Marine Corps base in Quantico,
Va., and the weapons were dummies. In this case, playacting was the
only option available. ``Nonlethal weapons still do not exist in a
form that serves a useful military function,'' says Steven
Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles are more serious than just having to wait for the
technology to catch up with the idea, says Colonel John Alexander,
a former Green Beret and an expert on nonlethals. ``The strategic
use of nonlethal weapons is very complex and not well explored.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. experience during the famine-relief mission in Somalia
underscores his point. In 1995, as the effort disintegrated into
chaos, the commanding officer of the American forces called for
nonlethal weapons to facilitate a smooth exodus. He received two
kinds of fancy, novel nonlethals: an experimental sticky foam that
could be sprayed from pressure-charged canisters, and high-powered
lasers that could be used to disorient the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than using the foam to incapacitate individual
militiamen, the Marines sprayed the material to form barriers that
would hold back hostile Somalian crowds. The barriers didn't help
much. The locals quickly learned to clamber over the foam pilings
with wooden planks. Plus, American soldiers had to be cautious when
shooting the foam because it could have suffocated the same people
they had come to feed.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the possible blinding of Somalians with lasers
limited the effectiveness of the other major new nonlethal weapon.
The Marines reduced the power of the lasers and used them merely to
frighten people into thinking they had been targeted.
</P>
<P>
   After Somalia, advocates of weapons that don't kill toned down
their rhetoric. ``They were making wild claims that this technology
would do everything but cure the common cold,'' says Aftergood.
``The limited field experience yielded a more realistic
assessment.'' But this year the Department of Defense has allocated
about $99 million for nonlethal-weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be used to solve a confounding problem. Not only
must nonlethals work as weapons, they must do their job gently
enough to avoid what is sometimes called the CNN effect: as soon as
Americans see televised images of bloody bodies, support for even
reasonable peacekeeping missions evaporates. As unrealistic as it
may seem, ``there's hope that there is a way to solve problems
without hurting anyone,'' says Harvey Sapolsky, director of the
Security Studies Program at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons that cause only disabilities may nevertheless be
considered unacceptable if they lead to what Sapolsky calls ``worse
than lethal outcomes.'' In the ethics of warfare, some strategists
consider a bullet through the brain better than permanent blindness
or insanity (so hallucinogenic drugs are ruled out).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the image of the perfect nonlethal weapon _ a Star
Trek-style phaser set on stun _ is so powerful that no one has
given up on the idea. This year the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency is collaborating with the National Institute of
Justice to develop a more sophisticated laser weapon _ a ``laser
dazzler'' that diffuses a beam just enough to avoid permanent eye
damage. Not surprisingly, police forces are as interested in its
development as the military is.
</P>
<P>
   Versions of the sticky foam tested in Somalia are also alive. At
Sandia National Laboratories, smaller, convenient pressurized
backpacks pump out refined goo, though Swett now rejects it as too
tough to control.
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems plague sonic weapons, which blast
high-intensity sound waves to make internal organs mighty
uncomfortable. Also low-frequency sounds are difficult to aim
because they tend to spread in all directions, and high-frequency
sounds can cause permanent deafness.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of the really scary is a microwave gun under study
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory that raises body temperature,
provoking a debilitating fever. Just testing such a weapon raises
safety issues, so team leader Clay Easterly has created a
virtual-human computer model to ``minimize the need for actual
human subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly odd but intriguing is the Odorous Substances
Project of the Joint Non-lethal Weapons Directorate. The idea is to
create unbearable stink bombs. Alexander thinks a smell assault,
for example, might have worked well against the pharmaceutical
plant in Sudan that was attacked by U.S. cruise missiles last
August. A stink bomb that leaves behind the smell of a ripe corpse
would have allowed the salvage of some equipment from the facility
but would have insured that the location remained unusable for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows, of course, if any of these ideas will
eventually prove effective. ``Nonlethal weapons are a very
appealing idea,'' Sapolsky says. But he suspects they will
ultimately be more helpful to police forces than to military
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more skeptical. ``I think nonlethal weapons are a
fad,'' says Andrew Bacevich of Boston University, a former Army
cavalry commander. Their appeal will fade quickly, he argues, as
soon as the other side decides to up the ante with good
old-fashioned lethal weapons: ``We put some sticky goo on them, and
they'll put a bullet through the head of a U.S. soldier.'' At that
point, Swett confirms, we would return to deadly force.

   On a wall in the Brooklyn Museum of Art's conservation
department hangs a remarkable oddity, ``Forest Scene with Brook.''
A century ago, an early American modernist painter named Ralph
Albert Blakelock put his finishing touches on the charming
landscape and set it aside. Curiously, the painting never dried.
``Today the painting has slid off the canvas and onto the frame,''
says conservator Carolyn Tomkiewicz. ``The image is a complete
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakelock's catastrophe, Tomkiewicz and her colleagues believe,
was probably triggered in part by his use of a synthetic pigment
known as Van Dyke brown. The pigment appears to have retarded the
process of drying that has kept other oil paintings clinging to
their canvases for centuries. The demise of ``Forest Scene with
Brook'' illustrates a larger issue: coming up with the materials to
make a painting permanent may be as big a challenge as painting it
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   To help preserve and authenticate paintings, conservators have
learned to examine them using techniques more common in a forensics
laboratory than in a museum. Poring over flecks of paint narrower
than the width of a human hair, these art doctors have explored the
secrets of some of the world's greatest paintings.
</P>
<P>
   When a vandal slashed Rembrandt's ``The Night Watch,''
conservators at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam matched pigments and
painting strokes to stitch the masterpiece together again. In the
Vatican, Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling murals took on
brilliant new tones once conservators removed centuries of grime by
dabbing them with a watery solution of baking soda and other mild
ingredients. Understanding the basic chemistry of paints and
pigments helps conservators work gently as they preserve original
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Pigments have a long, rich history. Prehistoric people first
made patterns and images by rubbing chunks of charcoal and iron
oxide onto cave walls. Roman artists created striking translucent
portraits by painstakingly combining pigments with hot wax, then
spreading the mixture onto wooden panels. Medieval scribes frothed
up eggs with water and added colors to produce elaborate
illuminated manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a revolution was occurring in northern Europe.
Painters, particularly in the Netherlands, were mixing pigments
with plant oils such as linseed and walnut. These special drying
oils undergo a process known as polymerization. When exposed to
air, the molecules of fat within the oils absorb oxygen and link
together to form insoluble films. Oils allow painters to use
techniques unimaginable with egg tempera.
</P>
<P>
   Working in oils, Renaissance artists could create a vivid
illusion of reality by making individual brush strokes disappear.
Because the paintings also tended to be varnished with shellac, a
purified waxy resin excreted onto twigs by tree-dwelling insects
called lacs, surface imperfections could be smoothed out.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the binding mediums for paints evolved, so did the
pigments. Even a color as fundamental as white has gone through an
elaborate evolution. The Romans developed a pigment called lead
white, which they created by processing lead with vinegar. On their
own, oil and lead white pigment are both transparent, but they
become beautifully opaque when mixed.
</P>
<P>
   A rival to the whiteness of lead appeared after the discovery of
zinc in the eighteenth century. Chemists introduced zinc oxide,
which became popular in the 1830s. The zinc-based paint had a bluer
hue, which some painters preferred
</P>
<P>
   During the Renaissance, the most prized color was ultramarine
blue, which was made from precious crushed lapis lazuli and usually
reserved for the blue in the Virgin Mary's mantel.
</P>
<P>
   Yellows evolved as well. Around 1300, painters began using
lead-tin yellow, a pigment formed by heating lead and tin oxides in
a crucible to tremendously high temperatures. Another shade, called
Indian yellow, was made on the subcontinent by feeding mangoes to
cows and concentrating the urine to retrieve the calcium and
magnesium salts that create the color. (The British government
outlawed the process in 1908 on the grounds of cruelty.)
</P>
<P>
   Chemists can use these distinct chapters in the technological
history of paint to help determine the authenticity of a work of
art. In the 1980s, during an inspection of a painting known as
``Virgin and Child with Saints John the Evangelist and Paul,''
believed to date from the 1400s, a chemical analysis of a tiny chip
of paint found a nasty surprise: zinc. Il Bergognone, the purported
painter, could not possibly have had a zinc-based pigment on his
palette some four centuries before the element's discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious that the zinc pigment was applied during a modern
restoration, James Martin, a chemist at the Williamstown Art
Conservation Center in Massachusetts, took a closer look at the
painting. Working with a microscope and a computer monitor and a
scanning electron microscope, Martin found lead and tin, an
indication that the pigment was lead-tin yellow _ which dated the
painting to before 1750. The painting was attributed to the school
of Il Bergognone and returned to its wall in the neighboring Clark
Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In many old paintings, the original work has been lost beneath
countless layers of touch-ups and revisions by later artists ``Art
Restoration used to be done in secret, so that no one had any idea
what the condition of the original painting was,'' says Martin.
Using a variety of techniques, from X-rays to infrared imaging,
modern conservators can find out.
</P>
<P>
   But deciding what to fix and what to leave alone has become a
touchy issue for modern conservators. Using microscopic analysis to
determine the chemical composition of the original pigments,
conservators now apply paint only to areas where the damage is so
distracting it cannot be left alone. Cotton swabs soaked with
saliva are used to dab paintings clean; the enzymes in saliva
dissolve surface proteins and grime safely, without harming the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Works of modern art present a whole new set of problems for
conservators. Jackson Pollock, for instance, used drums of World
War 11 surplus paints for his splashiest effects, and he often
added texture by mixing in things such as cigarette butts. These
appear to be stable, so far at least.

   On a wall in the Brooklyn Museum of Art's conservation
department hangs a remarkable oddity, ``Forest Scene with Brook.''
A century ago, an early American modernist painter named Ralph
Albert Blakelock put his finishing touches on the charming
landscape and set it aside. Curiously, the painting never dried.
``Today the painting has slid off the canvas and onto the frame,''
says conservator Carolyn Tomkiewicz. ``The image is a complete
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakelock's catastrophe, Tomkiewicz and her colleagues believe,
was probably triggered in part by his use of a synthetic pigment
known as Van Dyke brown. The pigment appears to have retarded the
process of drying that has kept other oil paintings clinging to
their canvases for centuries. The demise of ``Forest Scene with
Brook'' illustrates a larger issue: coming up with the materials to
make a painting permanent may be as big a challenge as painting it
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   To help preserve and authenticate paintings, conservators have
learned to examine them using techniques more common in a forensics
laboratory than in a museum. Poring over flecks of paint narrower
than the width of a human hair, these art doctors have explored the
secrets of some of the world's greatest paintings.
</P>
<P>
   When a vandal slashed Rembrandt's ``The Night Watch,''
conservators at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam matched pigments and
painting strokes to stitch the masterpiece together again. In the
Vatican, Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling murals took on
brilliant new tones once conservators removed centuries of grime by
dabbing them with a watery solution of baking soda and other mild
ingredients. Understanding the basic chemistry of paints and
pigments helps conservators work gently as they preserve original
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Pigments have a long, rich history. Prehistoric people first
made patterns and images by rubbing chunks of charcoal and iron
oxide onto cave walls. Roman artists created striking translucent
portraits by painstakingly combining pigments with hot wax, then
spreading the mixture onto wooden panels. Medieval scribes frothed
up eggs with water and added colors to produce elaborate
illuminated manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a revolution was occurring in northern Europe.
Painters, particularly in the Netherlands, were mixing pigments
with plant oils such as linseed and walnut. These special drying
oils undergo a process known as polymerization. When exposed to
air, the molecules of fat within the oils absorb oxygen and link
together to form insoluble films. Oils allow painters to use
techniques unimaginable with egg tempera.
</P>
<P>
   Working in oils, Renaissance artists could create a vivid
illusion of reality by making individual brush strokes disappear.
Because the paintings also tended to be varnished with shellac, a
purified waxy resin excreted onto twigs by tree-dwelling insects
called lacs, surface imperfections could be smoothed out.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the binding mediums for paints evolved, so did the
pigments. Even a color as fundamental as white has gone through an
elaborate evolution. The Romans developed a pigment called lead
white, which they created by processing lead with vinegar. On their
own, oil and lead white pigment are both transparent, but they
become beautifully opaque when mixed.
</P>
<P>
   A rival to the whiteness of lead appeared after the discovery of
zinc in the eighteenth century. Chemists introduced zinc oxide,
which became popular in the 1830s. The zinc-based paint had a bluer
hue, which some painters preferred
</P>
<P>
   During the Renaissance, the most prized color was ultramarine
blue, which was made from precious crushed lapis lazuli and usually
reserved for the blue in the Virgin Mary's mantel.
</P>
<P>
   Yellows evolved as well. Around 1300, painters began using
lead-tin yellow, a pigment formed by heating lead and tin oxides in
a crucible to tremendously high temperatures. Another shade, called
Indian yellow, was made on the subcontinent by feeding mangoes to
cows and concentrating the urine to retrieve the calcium and
magnesium salts that create the color. (The British government
outlawed the process in 1908 on the grounds of cruelty.)
</P>
<P>
   Chemists can use these distinct chapters in the technological
history of paint to help determine the authenticity of a work of
art. In the 1980s, during an inspection of a painting known as
``Virgin and Child with Saints John the Evangelist and Paul,''
believed to date from the 1400s, a chemical analysis of a tiny chip
of paint found a nasty surprise: zinc. Il Bergognone, the purported
painter, could not possibly have had a zinc-based pigment on his
palette some four centuries before the element's discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious that the zinc pigment was applied during a modern
restoration, James Martin, a chemist at the Williamstown Art
Conservation Center in Massachusetts, took a closer look at the
painting. Working with a microscope and a computer monitor and a
scanning electron microscope, Martin found lead and tin, an
indication that the pigment was lead-tin yellow _ which dated the
painting to before 1750. The painting was attributed to the school
of Il Bergognone and returned to its wall in the neighboring Clark
Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In many old paintings, the original work has been lost beneath
countless layers of touch-ups and revisions by later artists ``Art

what the condition of the original painting was,'' says Martin.

   Last December, armed rebels captured a group of U.S. Marines and
held them hostage in a makeshift compound. Nearby, terrorist gunmen
hid among local civilians, waiting for the arrival of additional
American forces. The situation seemed headed for a stalemate until
a second group of Marines showed up bearing exotic weapons that
disabled the enemy soldiers without killing them. The weapons
included microwave guns, sonic cannons, and disorienting laser
strobes. The savior Marines stormed the compound without bloodshed,
rescued their comrades and escaped with minor casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The battle? A field exercise at a Marine Corps base in Quantico,
Va., and the weapons were dummies. In this case, playacting was the
only option available. ``Nonlethal weapons still do not exist in a
form that serves a useful military function,'' says Steven
Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles are more serious than just having to wait for the
technology to catch up with the idea, says Colonel John Alexander,
a former Green Beret and an expert on nonlethals. ``The strategic
use of nonlethal weapons is very complex and not well explored.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. experience during the famine-relief mission in Somalia
underscores his point. In 1995, as the effort disintegrated into
chaos, the commanding officer of the American forces called for
nonlethal weapons to facilitate a smooth exodus. He received two
kinds of fancy, novel nonlethals: an experimental sticky foam that
could be sprayed from pressure-charged canisters, and high-powered
lasers that could be used to disorient the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than using the foam to incapacitate individual
militiamen, the Marines sprayed the material to form barriers that
would hold back hostile Somalian crowds. The barriers didn't help
much. The locals quickly learned to clamber over the foam pilings
with wooden planks. Plus, American soldiers had to be cautious when
shooting the foam because it could have suffocated the same people
they had come to feed.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the possible blinding of Somalians with lasers
limited the effectiveness of the other major new nonlethal weapon.
The Marines reduced the power of the lasers and used them merely to
frighten people into thinking they had been targeted.
</P>
<P>
   After Somalia, advocates of weapons that don't kill toned down
their rhetoric. ``They were making wild claims that this technology
would do everything but cure the common cold,'' says Aftergood.
``The limited field experience yielded a more realistic
assessment.'' But this year the Department of Defense has allocated
about $99 million for nonlethal-weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be used to solve a confounding problem. Not only
must nonlethals work as weapons, they must do their job gently
enough to avoid what is sometimes called the CNN effect: as soon as
Americans see televised images of bloody bodies, support for even
reasonable peacekeeping missions evaporates. As unrealistic as it
may seem, ``there's hope that there is a way to solve problems
without hurting anyone,'' says Harvey Sapolsky, director of the
Security Studies Program at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons that cause only disabilities may nevertheless be
considered unacceptable if they lead to what Sapolsky calls ``worse
than lethal outcomes.'' In the ethics of warfare, some strategists
consider a bullet through the brain better than permanent blindness
or insanity (so hallucinogenic drugs are ruled out).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the image of the perfect nonlethal weapon _ a Star
Trek-style phaser set on stun _ is so powerful that no one has
given up on the idea. This year the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency is collaborating with the National Institute of
Justice to develop a more sophisticated laser weapon _ a ``laser
dazzler'' that diffuses a beam just enough to avoid permanent eye
damage. Not surprisingly, police forces are as interested in its
development as the military is.
</P>
<P>
   Versions of the sticky foam tested in Somalia are also alive. At
Sandia National Laboratories, smaller, convenient pressurized
backpacks pump out refined goo, though Swett now rejects it as too
tough to control.
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems plague sonic weapons, which blast
high-intensity sound waves to make internal organs mighty
uncomfortable. Also low-frequency sounds are difficult to aim
because they tend to spread in all directions, and high-frequency
sounds can cause permanent deafness.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of the really scary is a microwave gun under study
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory that raises body temperature,
provoking a debilitating fever. Just testing such a weapon raises
safety issues, so team leader Clay Easterly has created a
virtual-human computer model to ``minimize the need for actual
human subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly odd but intriguing is the Odorous Substances
Project of the Joint Non-lethal Weapons Directorate. The idea is to
create unbearable stink bombs. Alexander thinks a smell assault,
for example, might have worked well against the pharmaceutical
plant in Sudan that was attacked by U.S. cruise missiles last
August. A stink bomb that leaves behind the smell of a ripe corpse
would have allowed the salvage of some equipment from the facility
but would have insured that the location remained unusable for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows, of course, if any of these ideas will
eventually prove effective. ``Nonlethal weapons are a very
appealing idea,'' Sapolsky says. But he suspects they will
ultimately be more helpful to police forces than to military
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more skeptical. ``I think nonlethal weapons are a
fad,'' says Andrew Bacevich of Boston University, a former Army
cavalry commander. Their appeal will fade quickly, he argues, as
soon as the other side decides to up the ante with good
old-fashioned lethal weapons: ``We put some sticky goo on them, and
they'll put a bullet through the head of a U.S. soldier.'' At that
point, Swett confirms, we would return to deadly force.

purified waxy resin excreted onto twigs by tree-dwelling insects
called lacs, surface imperfections could be smoothed out.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the binding mediums for paints evolved, so did the
pigments. Even a color as fundamental as white has gone through an
elaborate evolution. The Romans developed a pigment called lead
white, which they created by processing lead with vinegar. On their
own, oil and lead white pigment are both transparent, but they
become beautifully opaque when mixed.
</P>
<P>
   A rival to the whiteness of lead appeared after the discovery of
zinc in the eighteenth century. Chemists introduced zinc oxide,
which became popular in the 1830s. The zinc-based paint had a bluer
hue, which some painters preferred
</P>
<P>
   During the Renaissance, the most prized color was ultramarine
blue, which was made from precious crushed lapis lazuli and usually
reserved for the blue in the Virgin Mary's mantel.
</P>
<P>
   Yellows evolved as well. Around 1300, painters began using
lead-tin yellow, a pigment formed by heating lead and tin oxides in
a crucible to tremendously high temperatures. Another shade, called
Indian yellow, was made on the subcontinent by feeding mangoes to
cows and concentrating the urine to retrieve the calcium and
magnesium salts that create the color. (The British government
outlawed the process in 1908 on the grounds of cruelty.)
</P>
<P>
   Chemists can use these distinct chapters in the technological
history of paint to help determine the authenticity of a work of
art. In the 1980s, during an inspection of a painting known as
``Virgin and Child with Saints John the Evangelist and Paul,''
believed to date from the 1400s, a chemical analysis of a tiny chip
of paint found a nasty surprise: zinc. Il Bergognone, the purported
painter, could not possibly have had a zinc-based pigment on his
palette some four centuries before the element's discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious that the zinc pigment was applied during a modern
restoration, James Martin, a chemist at the Williamstown Art
Conservation Center in Massachusetts, took a closer look at the
painting. Working with a microscope and a computer monitor and a
scanning electron microscope, Martin found lead and tin, an
indication that the pigment was lead-tin yellow _ which dated the
painting to before 1750. The painting was attributed to the school
of Il Bergognone and returned to its wall in the neighboring Clark
Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In many old paintings, the original work has been lost beneath
countless layers of touch-ups and revisions by later artists ``Art
Restoration used to be done in secret, so that no one had any idea
what the condition of the original painting was,'' says Martin.
Using a variety of techniques, from X-rays to infrared imaging,
modern conservators can find out.
</P>
<P>
   But deciding what to fix and what to leave alone has become a
touchy issue for modern conservators. Using microscopic analysis to
determine the chemical composition of the original pigments,
conservators now apply paint only to areas where the damage is so
distracting it cannot be left alone. Cotton swabs soaked with
saliva are used to dab paintings clean; the enzymes in saliva
dissolve surface proteins and grime safely, without harming the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Works of modern art present a whole new set of problems for
conservators. Jackson Pollock, for instance, used drums of World
War 11 surplus paints for his splashiest effects, and he often
added texture by mixing in things such as cigarette butts. These
appear to be stable, so far at least.

   On a wall in the Brooklyn Museum of Art's conservation
department hangs a remarkable oddity, ``Forest Scene with Brook.''
A century ago, an early American modernist painter named Ralph
Albert Blakelock put his finishing touches on the charming
landscape and set it aside. Curiously, the painting never dried.
``Today the painting has slid off the canvas and onto the frame,''
says conservator Carolyn Tomkiewicz. ``The image is a complete
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakelock's catastrophe, Tomkiewicz and her colleagues believe,
was probably triggered in part by his use of a synthetic pigment
known as Van Dyke brown. The pigment appears to have retarded the
process of drying that has kept other oil paintings clinging to
their canvases for centuries. The demise of ``Forest Scene with
Brook'' illustrates a larger issue: coming up with the materials to
make a painting permanent may be as big a challenge as painting it
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   To help preserve and authenticate paintings, conservators have
learned to examine them using techniques more common in a forensics
laboratory than in a museum. Poring over flecks of paint narrower
than the width of a human hair, these art doctors have explored the
secrets of some of the world's greatest paintings.
</P>
<P>
   When a vandal slashed Rembrandt's ``The Night Watch,''
conservators at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam matched pigments and
painting strokes to stitch the masterpiece together again. In the
Vatican, Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling murals took on
brilliant new tones once conservators removed centuries of grime by
dabbing them with a watery solution of baking soda and other mild
ingredients. Understanding the basic chemistry of paints and
pigments helps conservators work gently as they preserve original
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Pigments have a long, rich history. Prehistoric people first
made patterns and images by rubbing chunks of charcoal and iron
oxide onto cave walls. Roman artists created striking translucent
portraits by painstakingly combining pigments with hot wax, then
spreading the mixture onto wooden panels. Medieval scribes frothed
up eggs with water and added colors to produce elaborate
illuminated manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a revolution was occurring in northern Europe.
Painters, particularly in the Netherlands, were mixing pigments
with plant oils such as linseed and walnut. These special drying
oils undergo a process known as polymerization. When exposed to
air, the molecules of fat within the oils absorb oxygen and link
together to form insoluble films. Oils allow painters to use
techniques unimaginable with egg tempera.
</P>
<P>
   Working in oils, Renaissance artists could create a vivid
illusion of reality by making individual brush strokes disappear.
Because the paintings also tended to be varnished with shellac, a
purified waxy resin excreted onto twigs by tree-dwelling insects
called lacs, surface imperfections could be smoothed out.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the binding mediums for paints evolved, so did the

IN DEFENSE OF THE QUEEN'S ENGLISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 30)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her annual address to her subjects, Queen Elizabeth II
updated the ``out of the mouths of babes'' idea with this
observation: ``The young can sometimes be wiser than us.''
</P>
<P>
   T.R. Reid, London bureau chief of The Washington Post,
commented: `` &UR; Than us &LR; ? I wondered: Is this proper English? So I
dug out the Oxford Guide to English Usage and found that Her
Majesty was wrong. No one was more dismayed than I.''
</P>
<P>
   Here we go again in the great battle between the Concerned
Conjunctionites and the Proper Preppies. The crucial question: Is
 &UR; than &LR;  a conjunction that must be followed by a pronoun in the
nominative case ( &UR; I &LR; ,  &UR; we &LR; ,  &UR; they &LR; ) or is  &UR; than &LR;  a preposition that
must take a pronoun in the objective case ( &UR; me &LR; ,  &UR; us &LR; ,  &UR; them &LR; )?
</P>
<P>
   Reid and his conjunctionite buddies have not only the Oxford
usagists behind their stiff-upper-lip stand. Erik Wensberg, reviser
of Wilson Follett's Modern American Usage, says, ``In the queen's
construction,  &UR; than us &LR;  is at best colloquial and at worst simply
wrong.'' Then he adds: ``But as she rightly sensed,  &UR; than we &LR;  is
annoyingly starchy. The answer?  &UR; Than we are &LR; . It maintains strict
grammar and achieves better rhythm as well.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a cop-out; in this scrap, you gotta choose up sides (he
averred colloquially). The New York Times stylebook is
conjunctionite, demanding that  &UR; we &LR;  follow  &UR; than &LR; , no matter what
most New Yorkers say. Jack Kilpatrick, ``The Writer's Art''
columnist who is more prescriptive than me (whoops!), says: ``I
think the queen was wrong in her use of  &UR; wiser than us &LR; . It should
have taken the nominative.  &UR; Us &LR;  sounds awkward, doesn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Not to me. I am a Proper Preppie. To my ear, keenly attuned to
the actions and passions of my time, it's  &UR; wiser than we &LR;  that
sounds stuffy, stilted and strained, not to mention cribbed,
cabin'd and confined. And speaking of Shakespeare, how about ``a
man no mightier  &UR; than thyself or me &LR; ,'' said by Cassius about
Julius Caesar? Or what of John Milton's use, in ``Paradise Lost,''
of `` &UR; than whom &LR; , Satan except, none higher sat''?  &UR; Whom &LR;  is
objective, ain't it?
</P>
<P>
   There are those who believe that the combined judgment of the
firm of Shakespeare, Milton &AMP; Safire cannot stand up to the
 &UR; diktat &LR;  of the legion of Conjunctionites. I will grant that famed
writers make mistakes; even Homer noodled. But we who dare to treat
 &UR; than &LR;  as a preposition have our authoritative defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regularly hear  &UR; than I &LR;  and  &UR; than me &LR; ,'' writes Kenneth G.
Wilson in The Columbia Guide to Standard American English. ``Some
commentators think that the conjunction is currently more frequent
than the preposition, but both are unquestionably standard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would allow  &UR; wiser than us &LR;  because it is perfectly normal
English usage,'' says Robert Burchfield, retired editor of the
Oxford English Dictionary and most recent reviser of Fowler's
Modern English Usage, from his home in Oxfordshire. ``In British
English we use both standard forms. The queen was right,'' he says,
adding loyally, ``She always is.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Fowler himself noted in an earlier edition: ``The
prepositional use of  &UR; than &LR;  is now so common colloquially (He is
 &UR; older than me &LR; ) that the bare subjective pronoun in such a
position strikes the reader as pedantic.'' (By  &UR; subjective &LR;  he uses
a synonym for  &UR; nominative &LR; , the case required by the  &UR; conjunctive &LR; .
That's what St. Henry thinks is pedantic and to be avoided.)
</P>
<P>
   Now let's review the bidding. On formal occasions, like an
address from the throne, most authorities would advise royal
speechwriters to stiffen the sinews, stretch the nostrils wide and
treat  &UR; than &LR;  as a conjunction, followed by  &UR; I &LR; ,  &UR; we &LR;  or  &UR; they &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   But even as they once more fling their bodies unto this breach,
the Conjunctionites seem uncomfortable because they can feel the
tectonic plates of language shifting under them. That's why they
all say, ``But the prepositional way is OK in colloquial speech,''
in a plaintive, real-life-is-passing-us-by tone.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing the proper prepositional in a formal address, the
queen decided the time was ripe to eschew pedantry even at the risk
of being criticized as grammatically incorrect. Because royalty is
trying to escape rigidity and adopt a common touch, she preferred
on this formal occasion to adopt the informal usage of commoners,
which is sometimes called common usage.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are hip will hooray. All hail the prepositional
 &UR; than &LR; ! Long Live the Royal  &UR; Us &LR; !
</P>
<P>
   FOR SHAME
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Shameless &LR; ,  &UR; reckless &LR;  and  &UR; indefensible &LR;  were adjectives used
in first reports of a censure resolution early this year. When Sen.
Dianne Feinstein submitted her resolution (which was never voted
on), a key word was changed:  &UR; shameless &LR;  became  &UR; shameful &LR; . What's
the difference?
</P>
<P>
   The difference lies in the word that is modified. If it is the
agent who lacks shame _ who observes few constraints of modesty or
morality _ then that person is  &UR; shameless &LR; . If the word being
modified is the action itself rather than the person, then the
action is filled with shame, or is  &UR; shameful &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   If I danced drunkenly through Times Square in the nude on
Millennium Eve, I would be  &UR; shameless &LR; . You, if you were clothed
and sober, might find my celebration  &UR; shameful &LR; .

MEMOIR'S SPY CHARGES SPUR DEBATE AMONG SCIENTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It was supposed to be a kind of detective
story, the clever unmasking of the identity of a former Manhattan
Project scientist who may have passed atomic secrets to the Soviets
during World War II. Instead, it has turned into an acrimonious
battle to preserve the reputation of one of the nation's most
revered scientists, MIT's Philip Morrison, after charges of
espionage were leveled against him by a respected public-interest
activist and author.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the story especially odd and poignant is that the two
men were longtime friends. They are unlikely to be again.
</P>
<P>
   The story exploded with the publication last month of a memoir
by Jeremy Stone, son of the crusading independent reporter I.F.
Stone and, for the last 30 years, president of the Federation of
American Scientists. In the book's next-to-last chapter, he details
a series of conversations and visits with a scientist he calls
Scientist X, who he comes to believe was a Soviet spy, code-named
Perseus.
</P>
<P>
   But Scientist X was easily identified as the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's Morrison, who then sent Stone a letter
detailing clear-cut discrepancies that show he could not have been
Perseus. Stone responded with a terse letter acknowledging the
discrepancies, and saying that ``I can only accept your denial that
you are Perseus.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Stone's failure to apologize for his allegations or to
change the book, some members of the federation are debating
whether stronger remedies may be appropriate. Documents summarizing
the tale were sent to members of the federation's governing board
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just outraged'' by the unsubstantiated charges in
Stone's book ``Every Man Should Try,'' said Priscilla McMillan, a
professor at Harvard University's Russian Research Center and
secretary of the federation. Despite Stone's attempts to conceal
Morrison's identity, she said, ``anybody who knew anything about
the history of the Manhattan Project would know who it was.''
</P>
<P>
   While both men are held in high regard, several scientists and
historians contacted by the Globe who know them both expressed
dismay at Stone's actions and unreserved support for Morrison. ``I
think Phil is unscathed by this,'' said Frank von Hippel, chairman
of the federation's nonprofit foundation.
</P>
<P>
   As for Stone, von Hippel said, ``some people would like him to
apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   It began with the 1991 publication of a series of articles by
Colonel Vladimir Chikov, and then a 1994 book by Pavel Sudoplatov,
both former KGB officials who mentioned Perseus as having been one
of a half-dozen scientists who they claim provided secret
information about the development of the atomic bomb to Soviet
agents during the war.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there were obvious discrepancies between Morrison and
the Perseus described by Chikov, making it clear that Morrison
could not have been that spy _ if, indeed, such a person ever
existed.
</P>
<P>
   But if Perseus was real, the articles make it clear that
Morrison was not the one. They refer to Perseus having been
recruited by the KGB during a visit to his ill parents in New York,
whereas Morrison's parents lived in Philadelphia at the time. And
they say that Perseus was fighting with the International Brigades
in Spain, whereas Morrison, as he pointed out in his letter to
Stone, ``was never plausible infantry material.'' Morrison,
stricken with polio as a child, always walked with a severe limp
and a cane.
</P>
<P>
   If the discrepancies were so clear, what led Stone to make his
identification in the first place? It all appears to have been
based on a turn of phrase and on interpretations of body language.
</P>
<P>
   The first clue, Stone says in his book, was a few sentences
attributed to Perseus in the Chikov article, describing his
motivations for providing atomic information to Russia. Unlike more
recent spy cases, there was no financial motive here; Perseus
apparently believed that for the United States alone to have the
bomb would be a dangerous and unstable situation, and that it was
important for the Soviet Union to join the nuclear club as quickly
as possible to restore a balance of power. Stone thought the
sentiments and one particular phrase sounded like the voice of his
friend Morrison _ even though, as he acknowledged, the quote had
been translated from English to Russian and back again and then
edited.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison not only denies the identification, he strongly eschews
the sentiments ascribed to the wartime Perseus. ``No, I didn't feel
that way,'' he said in an interview Friday. ``I think it's simply
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting this hunch that Perseus might be Morrison, Stone
recounts that in 1994, he visited Morrison and his wife twice to
try to sound them out. But, as he makes clear in the book, he never
actually stated what was on his mind, instead talking in broad
terms about Perseus and about trying to get that person to tell his
story.
</P>
<P>
   In those meetings, Stone says Morrison became so fearful that
his knees shook, and that Phylis Morrison's reactions seemed to
confirm his suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to written questions from the Globe, Stone
summarized his reasons for going ahead: ``The chapter was written
only because, in conjunction with everything else . . . during a
discussion of Perseus between myself and the Morrisons, Phylis
seemed to have actually identified Phil as Perseus by throwing a
fit, pointing at him, and urging me to reach a `tacit agreement'
with him while he sat there silently. I felt entrapped by this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morrison says that in pointing to him during that
conversation, Phylis was merely recognizing and reacting to the
still-unstated accusation by Stone against Morrison. And the
recalled quote is simply wrong, he says. The shaking knees,
Morrison said, were the result of aftereffects of his childhood
polio.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Morrison has been a long-term member of the
federation that Stone heads, and was instrumental not only in
hiring him, but in heading off an attempt to oust Stone from that
position years ago _ all of which Stone acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his written responses, Stone says that ``I have
always loved and admired Philip Morrison . . .'' His goal, he says,
is to persuade those people who participated in wartime espionage
to come forward and share their stories, in the interests of
history and to allow Americans to judge their motives for
themselves. And he acknowledges that ``it is entirely possible that
Perseus does not exist at all,'' and that ``obviously, Phil may
well be innocent of any violation of law whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether such statements will be enough to stave
off any attempt by the federation's board to demand further
response. Robert Park, a physicist and director of the American
Physical Society, although not a federation member, said he has
spoken with some members and that ``if there has not been already,
I would be astonished if there were not calls for his
resignation.'' In the meantime, he said, some members have already
talked about resigning in protest.

<P>
   Once again the Senate has passed a deeply flawed juvenile crime
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Senate wanted to allow juveniles to be jailed in
the same facility with adults, despite the horrors that arose from
such a practice.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., shilled
for that one and pushed the current racist juvenile crime bill (S.
254) through the Senate. It was passed May 20 by a 73-25 vote with
two senators abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   The troubling part of this juvenile crime bill is that it
eliminates the requirement forcing states to address the
disproportionate confinement of juveniles from minority groups. In
1988, Congress amended the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention Act of 1974 to include a mandate for states to study and
attempt to correct the problem of disproportionate minority
confinement (DMC). Forty-six states have completed their studies
and identified the problem in their law enforcement systems. Forty
states are developing plans to address DMC.
</P>
<P>
   The DMC mandate does not require arrest quotas or that any
minority juvenile be released from jail. The mandate requires
states to look at the problem. The Hatch-Sessions bill totally
discards that federal mandate.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for instance, minority youth consistently
received more severe punishments and were more likely to receive
jail time than white youth _ for the same offense. Six times as
many blacks are put in state juvenile facilities for crimes against
persons than whites who commit the same crimes.
</P>
<P>
   National figures show that approximately the same percentage of
white juveniles use drugs as black juveniles. Yet a study done by
the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives showed the
marked racial disparity in waging the drug war in Baltimore. In
1980, only 18 white juveniles were arrested in Baltimore and
charged with drug sales compared to 86 black juveniles arrested for
the same crime. By 1990, the disparity leaped enormously. Only 13
white juveniles were arrested for selling drugs, but 1,304 black
youths were arrested for the same crime.
</P>
<P>
   A black kid in Baltimore had 100 times more chances of being
arrested for a drug crime as his white counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   That's what is meant by disproportionate minority confinement.
It's a national problem. It's real and it's based upon racial
fears. Racism has been a growing specter in the juvenile justice
system since the turn of the century. The DMC mandate is a step to
dealing with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   One should note that there are no members of the Senate who are
black.
</P>
<P>
   The only member of a minority is American Indian, Sen. Ben
Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., who voted against S. 254.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch doesn't believe the disproportionate arrest rates for
minority juveniles is due to racism _ he stated on the Senate floor
that those are the kids who are selling drugs to ``our'' children
and they should be convicted. ``Our'' obviously means ``white'' in
Hatch's prejudiced parlance.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., hit the heart of the problem in
his response to Hatch: ``This is all about race. I cannot believe
that I have heard on the floor of the Senate an argument that race
is not the critical consideration. When the police are out there in
the streets, and we get to which kids are searched on the streets
and which are not, you don't think that has anything to do with
race? When we get to the question of which kids are arrested and
which kids are not, you don't think that has anything to do with
race today in America? ... When we get to the question of
sentencing, you don't think that has anything to do with race? You
are sleepwalking through history.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of this sad debate is that this juvenile crime bill is
loaded with anti-gun provisions and congressional hysteria because
of the recent school shootings of teens by teens _ the shooters all
white juveniles, by the way, and some of them from wealthy
families.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional hysteria (We must do something!) shows in the
senators' cry of a rising juvenile crime wave. Not so. Hatch and
Sessions used 1994 as the reference year for the presumption that
juvenile crime is on the rise, but neglected the latest data from
1995, 1996 and 1997 which show that juvenile crime has dropped
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   A letter dated May 10 to the Senate signed by 36 prominent
criminologists and crime policy experts pointed out the senators'
error: ``The Justice Department's Crime in the United States
reported last November that the juvenile homicide arrest rate had
dropped again for the fourth straight year _ by more than 45
percent since 1993.'' The letter goes further: ``Today, the
percentage of violent crime arrests attributed to juveniles is
lower than it was in 1975.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate version of the juvenile crime bill reaches
conference committee with the House version which still contains
the DMC mandate, the Congressional Black Caucus will play a pivotal
role in demanding that the DMC mandate remain in the final bill.
The caucus sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., pointing out that an overwhelming majority of House
members endorsed the retention of DMC in the House juvenile justice
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and Sessions ignore the clear evidence of the widespread
disparity in the treatment of minority juveniles in this nation's
law enforcement system. If the Hatch-Session's bill becomes law
without the DMC mandate, it will by that omission create a Jim Crow
justice system for minority children. Not a step forward, but a
long step backward.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Laws alone can't solve problems of our violent
society
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The following is an excerpt from an NRA ad:
``The gun came to America on the Mayflower. The right to own it
didn't. That right came with the blood and bravery of countless
patriots, whose valor now bestows it at birth upon every U.S.
citizen.'' It reminds us that weapons played an important part in
man's ``rise to freedom from oppression, and the sweet victory of
liberty over tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   True. All of it.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years ago our forefathers also needed guns to hunt
for food and keep wild animals at bay. Today the wild animals are
carrying the guns and the rest of us feel like ducks in a shooting
gallery. Is this what happens to an armed society when there are no
longer any common causes to rally around? We shoot each other?
</P>
<P>
   There were no guns in my parents' home. The first gun I ever saw
was the one my new husband, the airline pilot, brought with him
when we married and moved into an apartment on the west side of
Chicago. Although I can't quote caliber and make, I do remember it
was big, heavy, and lived in the night table drawer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``big gun'' and I were never on intimate terms. I watched my
husband clean it a few times but the only occasion I ever had to
handle it was during the weekly dusting.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot and I had been married less than a year. He was on a
three-day trip to somewhere, and I was home alone. The night was
dark and creepy, and so was our cavernous old apartment. The
bedroom was a long, dim hallway away from the front door. I was
propped up in bed, wearing a pair of my husband's pajamas, and
reading one of the spy novels he collected, when I heard someone
tampering with the front door lock. It was decision time.
</P>
<P>
   In silent slow motion, I threw back the covers and slid open the
night table drawer. The gun felt cold in my hand. As I slipped
soundlessly out of bed, I heard the front door squeak open. My
right hand awkwardly held the gun - while the left one clutched at
the waist of the too-big pajama bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   As I tiptoed down the hall an ugly idea occurred to me - what if
there was no shell in the chamber? What if in the next fraction of
a second I was going to be facing down an armed breaker-and-enterer
with an unloaded gun? I transferred the gun to my left hand and
reached for the slide with my right. And then it happened. My pants
fell down.
</P>
<P>
   Epiphany. Suddenly I knew that if I were going to shoot this bad
guy, I would have to do it with pajama bottoms around my ankles.
Helluva choice.
</P>
<P>
   But at that moment, the hall light clicked on. Not ten feet away
stood a handsome (but at that moment rather pale) guy in a uniform.
His trip had cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   Gently, he pried my fingers off the gun and laid it on the
telephone table, grinning as he eyeballed the heap around my feet
his pajama pants had become. ``Jeez, lady,'' he said, ``you almost
widowed yourself.'' I made a joke about collecting big on the
insurance - and then threw up all over his shiny shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost 40 years later, my emotions are still mixed. I truly
wish guns had never been invented - EVER - but I can't believe that
legislation and regulation will make the whole bad scene go away.
The trouble with our violent society runs much deeper than a
problem that can be solved by registration and waiting periods.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Charlton Heston needs to give up moonlighting as president
of the NRA, and go back to his day job as Moses. Maybe he needs to
haul those stone tablets back up the mountain and speak to us one
more time about all of those ``Thou shalt nots'' we've become so
careless with lately - particularly that fifth one - the one that
reads, ``Thou shalt not kill.''

 &HT;    IQ to I-Ching, favorite sites brighten the day
 &HT;    CYBERSCENE column
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For people who spend most of their working day and some of their
personal time connected to the Internet, the Web becomes part of
the daily routine.
</P>
<P>
   Just as someone who travels a lot in the real world _ the place
where it rains and the sun shines _ get to know the territory,
those of us who spend half our waking hours in cyberspace get to
know the lay of the land, as well.
</P>
<P>
   We have sites that are part of our practical everyday working
life. For instance, I check the weather by zapping over to the
Weather Channel (weather.com); or for looking up a street address,
e-mail address, or phone number go to Switchboard
(www.switchboard.com), or to find the best way to get to a business
across town use Yahoo!'s excellent mapping service
(/maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py).
</P>
<P>
   But over time, I've also found some places that just tickle me.
Just as a traveler might urge a friend to someday visit the
Petrified Forest or to plan a long week at the Grand Canyon, there
are some destinations that I like to recommend to my friends. Today
we'll talk about those favorite places.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have no notion in the world of just what our IQ is.
We know that it's an overrated way of measuring intelligence, but
yet there may be moments when you wonder just how smart you really
are. If you'd like a pretty good measuring stick on IQ, there's a
Web site that _ as nearly as I can tell _ produces reasonably
accurate results.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the Self-discovery Workshop and is at www.iqtest
</P>
<P>
   .com/welcometest.html. While at the page you can read a fairly
unbiased account of how IQ tests work.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can take, in just 18 minutes, an online version of the
IQ test. This isn't nearly as accurate as the kind of test you'd
pay hundreds of dollars to take, but _ based on the experiences of
some friends who had their IQ measured professionally _ the results
here are close enough to offer a rough gauge of how you'd test out.
</P>
<P>
   Since part of the test results are based on how much of the test
you complete in 18 minutes, make sure that you carve out at least
that much time for yourself if you decide to try the test. The nice
thing about taking an online test is that you can keep quiet if the
results horrify you. If, on the other hand, you wind up being an
undiscovered Einstein, then you can brag.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop on our tour is a site run by Bell Labs (the folks
who, among other things, brought you the transistor). It's located
at www.bell-labs.com
</P>
<P>
   /project/tts/.
</P>
<P>
   This particular part of the Bell Labs site deals with turning
computer text into synthesized human speech. While the notion of a
talking computer is no longer a novelty, the power of the program
demonstrated on this site is still impressive enough to bring a
smile. You can type in text, and then your computer will repeat it
back as spoken words.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, and this is my favorite of the bunch, there is a site
that uses the ancient fortunetelling technique called I-Ching on
the anything-but-ancient Web. Just go to this site at
www.iching.com/ and follow the directions.
</P>
<P>
   _ While you shouldn't use the advice you find here to start a
new life or decide what car to buy, it's a lot of fun and _
sometimes _ chillingly specific to the question that you ask.
</P>
<P>
   _ The site, by the way, is an advertisement for a program that
uses the same software you'll use online. But the Web version is so
good that you probably won't feel the need to buy the program, even
if you enjoy the experience.

 &HT;    NaturallySpeaking available soon
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some areas, dare I say it, the PC world commands a lead over
Apple Computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more significant is voice-recognition software, a
technology that Apple Computer pioneered.
</P>
<P>
   But Apple Computer is starting to close the gap, much to the
relief of many Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   At the company-sponsored Worldwide Developers conference two
weeks ago, interim chief executive Steve Jobs announced that Dragon
Systems will produce a Mac version of its NaturallySpeaking
software.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's NaturallySpeaking software is the leading
voice-recognition title in the United States. It enables computers
to translate conversational speech into text.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Dragon produced only a Windows version of
NaturallySpeaking. Now it will release a Mac version later this
year, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Macs have some limited voice-recognition capabilities through
their PlainTalk technology, which comes installed on most models.
PlainTalk, though, cannot translate conversational speech into
text.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Apple Computer has never had a Mac program that could
translate conversational speech. It hasn't been for a lack of
trying.
</P>
<P>
   The company had been working to enhance its voice technology
with a company called Articulate Systems Inc. But the two companies
couldn't get along, and Articulate pulled the plug on its Mac
offering, PowerSecretary, last year. Dragon Software, by the way,
owned a stake in Articulate.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dragon's Naturally- Speaking, released two years ago,
computers could only translate speech spoken unnaturally slowly and
clearly.
</P>
<P>
   NaturallySpeaking has created whole new uses for computers in
the past two years. Companies use it to take orders over the
telephone and provide automated customer support, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   And NaturallySpeaking is a wonderful alternative to people who
can no longer type because of repetitive stress injuries.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that NaturallySpeaking is perfect. Far from
it.
</P>
<P>
   NaturallySpeaking is a hog in terms of its requirements for disk
space and RAM. But the software is improving all the time with new
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon hasn't announced pricing or a brand name for its Mac
version of NaturallySpeaking. The Windows version, available in
several configurations, sells for between $200 and $700.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's Mac version of NaturallySpeaking also appears to be a
peace offering. It has battled with Apple Computer through the
years about voice-recognition technology patents. The two
companies, for example, have sued each other over the technology.

 &HT;    Web sites can help in tracing ancestors
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week I saw the places where my great-grandfather lived and
worked _ something I would not be able to do without the Web. For
me, the grandchild of Eastern European immigrants, learning about
my family history seemed nearly impossible. Finding bits of
information on the Web was a bit like shining a light in a dark
corner of my attic and finding unexpected treasures I didn't know
existed.
</P>
<P>
   I owe it all to Katie Couric. Well, actually, I owe it to the
entire anchor team of the ``Today'' show, who spent a week tracing
their respective family trees and posting lists of links to help
users get started in the job of researching their own families by
exploring on the MSNBC Web site.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Web sites that MSNBC had recommended were so
swamped by other novice genealogists like myself, it took a lot of
time for each page of requested information to load. Finally, I
just gave up and started looking for Web sites on my own, armed
with some of the links and suggestions that had been provided by
MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   I used to think that it would be impossible to trace my family
tree much past my grandparents, Morris and Fanny Katz, who came to
New York City in the early 1900s. Neither the Russians nor the
Nazis were much into keeping records of the Polish and Latvian
villages they plundered and destroyed in the first half of this
century.
</P>
<P>
   Even if I had the time and resources to travel to Europe to seek
out my family's records, I wouldn't know where to begin, because so
little is known about my great-grandparents. Making things even
worse are my family's many and conflicting oral histories. My
father has nine brothers and sisters who all tell different stories
about my grandparents and great-grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   So, although I am able to call up a wide variety of genealogy
sites and links on the Web, none of this stuff turned out to be of
much use to me, coming as I do from a family that can spend the
better part of a wedding reception _ as mine did once _ debating if
we really did have a Great Uncle Harry who absconded with the
family fortune and went to South Africa to strike it rich in the
diamond rush. The one thing everyone seems to agree on is where my
grandmother was born. It's a place called Slonim, which she said
was in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with just the name of a city in Poland, I began my search.
It was pretty discouraging at first. I tried searching for my
grandmother's maiden name but, since I didn't know quite how to
spell it, I had to rely on a ``sound-alike'' search engine that
couldn't come up with anything even close. After about a month of
searching nearly every genealogy site there I could find, I was
depressed and frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Before giving up entirely, I decided to call up one of the
search engines and type ``Slonim'' in the search field. I nearly
fell over when I found 71 sites. The reason I couldn't find Slonim
was now clear. After World War II,
</P>
<P>
   Slonim became part of the Soviet province of Belarus. More
searching led me to the homepage of a British genealogist whose
family had come from Slonim and who maintained a Web site devoted
to his family history. He included a page called ``The Ledger of
Slonim.''
</P>
<P>
   I discovered my grandmother's hometown had encouraged Jewish
immigrants who were escaping from the Crusades to settle there as
early as 1388. From all indications, it appears that Jews began
their settlement in Slonim that same year. The Web site describes
the prosperity of the city from the Renaissance through the late
1800s. There was also a page of pictures of libraries, synagogues
and other buildings my grandmother and her parents may have
frequented.
</P>
<P>
   The site also describes the anti-Semitic arson attacks on Jewish
homes and businesses. My great-grandfather's comb-and-brush factory
was burnt to the ground in one of these pogroms. That was when my
grandmother was given just enough money to go to America out of
harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   When my grandmother left Slonim in the 1900s, there were about
12,000 Jews living there. After the Germans took Slonim from the
Russians during World War II, the Jewish population dwindled to
zero, where it remains today. Further investigation, all done on
the Web, uncovered first-person accounts of life in Slonim after my
family had left and efforts of the Belarussian government to
restore the libraries and synagogues destroyed by previous
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for my family tree involved using what you could call
``the other Internet.'' So many people think of the Web as a
utility, something used for commercial or practical purposes. Along
with established commercial sites, there is a wealth of information
that will never make a dime or the Media Metrix top 10. But to
scholars, students and family tree-hunters like me, they are every
bit as valuable.

 &HT;    Software, Internet make tracing family tree easier
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene and Janice James of Riverside, Ohio had been interested in
the histories of their families for years, but Gene said they never
got deeply into the genealogy hobby until he retired around 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get started once or twice, but the record-keeping
and paper pushing was just horrendous,'' Gene James said. ``I
didn't have the time and patience for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Gene James is a dedicated hobby genealogist who has traced
his direct ancestry to the 17th century. And the tool that cut out
enough hassles for James to pursue the hobby is his home computer.
</P>
<P>
   James said the computer does two things that make genealogy
simpler, more fun and more efficient: It organizes records, and it
links hobbyists through the Internet for the exchange of ideas and
information.
</P>
<P>
   But unfortunately, the Internet is not the genealogy panacea
that some people believe. Genealogy experts like James and Carole
Medlar, genealogy librarian for the Dayton and Montgomery County
Public Library, say nothing can substitute yet for the hours people
spending looking through paper records for data about their
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who come in thinking they can find their
entire family tree on the Internet, but that's not usually true,''
Medlar said. ``That doesn't happen unless you stumble across
someone online who has gone to all the trouble before you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathering information
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in tracing your roots, a good place to
start is with your family members, according to James and Medlar.
And a key bit of information you need to have is where people
lived.
</P>
<P>
   James, for example, said his father left him a family tree with
names and dates relating to his ancestry. ``When I was starting out
I brought it to a woman who had been doing research, and she said
the things my father left me were exciting, but they weren't all
that useful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James was a civilian employee in the flight dynamics laboratory
before he retired, and he worked with computers 15 or 20 years
before retiring. He now writes a monthly column on computer
research for the newsletter of the local chapter of the Ohio
Genealogical Society.
</P>
<P>
   To get authoritative information on who was related to whom, a
researcher has to get to local records in the places their
ancestors were born, exchanged property, died and so on. In the
United States, most of the important records are kept at the county
level.
</P>
<P>
   A birth certificate on file in a county office with the names of
the parents and the child is an example of the kind of primary
source material that is tapped to produce a well-documented family
tree. Also important are marriage and death certificates, church
records, deeds and wills and old federal Census records.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar said only a fraction of that kind of information is
accessible directly through the Internet, but the Internet
computers at the public library are still a great resource for
genealogical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Researching genealogy has grown to be one of the top three
hobbies in the United States and the Internet does offer marvelous
support for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar said library patrons can log on to one of the library's
Internet computers to access databases with research information.
</P>
<P>
   One such database is the Social Security death benefit index,
she said. The online resource allows researchers to find the names
and dates people died and the names of people who received death
benefits after the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar said the library provides free access to some premium
reference databases. These are reference tools that normally carry
a subscription or per-use price, but the library pays the fees for
its patrons.
</P>
<P>
   If you're doing research on the Internet from home, the place
most people start is at cyndislist.com. Cyndi's List is a free site
managed by genealogist Cyndi Howell, and it contains links to
41,700 sites and archives.
</P>
<P>
   The sites include thousands of links to hobbyists who have
researched their family trees, and there's a chance you'll find
someone with common ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet resources, though, generally only provide clues
that point researchers to more traditional research avenues such as
county records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is all secondary data,'' James said. ``You can't
trust any of it as absolute.''
</P>
<P>
   The public library is a great source for noncomputer records.
For example, the Dayton library has microfilm Census records for
all Ohio counties through 1860 and for Montgomery County through
1920.
</P>
<P>
   The main branch of the Dayton library downtown has a genealogy
research section, and Medlar is on duty in the area from 2 to 6
p.m. Wednesdays. She's available at the reference desk on other
days.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar said even if researchers can pinpoint where to look for
old records, they usually have to review such records themselves to
get information. ``Usually county workers are busy doing county
work,'' she said. ``Going through old county records is not what
they're paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   James said he and his wife gather much of their information
while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't build our vacations around places we want to go to do
research,'' James said. ``But it's not unusual for us to stop for a
day on the way to going somewhere or on the way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizing information
</P>
<P>
   James said that where computers really shine is in compiling
data in a convenient form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working with the same piece of genealogy software
for the last nine years, and I still don't know all the things it
can do yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James said he keeps his genealogy records using a software
program called Brothers Keeper, but he said most of the programs on
the market cost about $15 to $45 and do basically the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   He said some popular programs include Family Tree Maker,
Ultimate Family Tree and Personal Ancestral File. To find reviews
of these programs and others, you can check the Genealogy Software
Springboard site at toltbbs.com/(tilde)kbasile/software.html.
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic types of interlinking records kept in
genealogy research.
</P>
<P>
   One is the ancestor sheet that starts with an individual then
names that individual's parents, and the parents' parents, and the
grandparents' parents, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The other type of record is a family group sheet. It lists a
husband, wife and their offspring along with some details about the
family's personal history.
</P>
<P>
   James said genealogy software allows the researcher to enter
data in a simple format. The software maintains the links between
people that have been entered into the system, and it helps the
researcher manipulate the data into useful forms.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the software packages allow the researcher to enter
notes on the people whose names are listed. Some also store photos
connected with records.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people go back a few generations and they stop trying
to go further and further back,'' James said. ``Instead they get
into researching details about their ancestors' lives. They're more
interested in what their ancestors did day to day than in anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   James said he's primarily been interested in tracing his direct
ancestors back as far as possible. So far he's traced his line back
eight generations to a man named David James who was born in 1660,
probably in Cardiff, Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Just including direct ancestors only going back eight
generations involves recording information on 256 people. And
James, who is still filling gaps in his direct lineage, also has
records of siblings and multiple marriages that make his database
even more complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would have been able to keep all this straight without
a computer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When James goes to a county office, cemetery or library to look
up information about his family, he doesn't take a notepad and
pencil like old fashioned genealogists. He takes a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Online exchanges
</P>
<P>
   In addition to record-keeping, James said computers are most
useful in linking researchers to other researchers via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days before the Internet your chances of finding
somebody else working on your family tree would be almost nil,'' he
said. ``Now it happens all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   James said his wife's maiden name was Allenduff and in 1800,
there were records for only two people with that name in the United
States. ``Nobody knows where they came from,'' he said. ``They
could have been dropped out of a spaceship.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with such a small family, James has found four people
online researching the Allenduff ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   He's found even more people researching the James lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The further you go back, the more direct ancestors you have,''
James explained. ``And the more direct ancestors you know about,
the better the chances are that some other direct descendant is
doing research, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Resources like Cyndi's List provide a way for people doing
research on their family trees to let the world know what they're
doing. And it's common for researchers to cross paths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard greeting is 'Hi, Cousin!' when you hear from a
relative you didn't know you had,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   He said researchers do more than chat when they meet on line;
they also exchange data.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, James said if he found a relative working on
James family history he and the relative would print out their
family tree records and send them in a big envelope.
</P>
<P>
   Now he said it's possible to send records electronically. Most
genealogy software programs are able to convert information into a
standard format that can be shared by other software programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in the last week a relative sent me an e-mail that had
data on 200 people in an attachment,'' he said. ``Every year you do
more exchanges and you send more data electronically.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, James doesn't just dump information from other
researchers into his own database without checking out the new
information first. ``It's source material just like everything
else. It gives you new information to look into.''
</P>
<P>
   James also said exchanging information via e-mail has its
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful with the information you send on living
people,'' he said. ``Things like mother's maiden name, for example.
Do you realize how often mother's maiden name and information like
that is used as a security check? You don't want to spread
information that someone could use to steal someone else's
identity.''

 &HT;    RadioMouse works, but who needs it?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox Ndews Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We gather today to examine a thing called RadioMouse.
</P>
<P>
   RadioMouse is not, as you might think, a mouse with an AM-FM
radio in it, although I'm sure that if one hasn't been marketed it
soon will be.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, RadioMouse is another wireless mouse.
</P>
<P>
   It has this small distinction, at least: It's the first wireless
mouse I've tried.
</P>
<P>
   RadioMouse is a two-button affair of a fairly conventional
humpback style, made rather heavy by the three AAA batteries it
requires. It is smaller than the Microsoft mouse to which I am
accustomed, and I do not find it as comfortable, but that may be a
matter of habit.
</P>
<P>
   The receiver is a small plastic box with a cord that attaches to
the mouse port. It can sit just about anywhere on the desk; it
doesn't seem to require being right in front of the mouse pad.
According to the manual, it can be six to 10 feet from the
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   That, basically, is all there is to RadioMouse. There isn't any
software; it is entirely plug-and-play and in my case, at least,
worked automatically with the Microsoft drivers already installed.
</P>
<P>
   The radio connection appears to work quite well.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the mouse itself. The
buttons are too sensitive, resulting in unwanted right-button
clicks. The ball and rollers have a tendency to lock up, as if
dirty.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the manual warns that ``Mouse ball is easy to attach
dirt and causes malfunction. Clean mouse ball and the two rolling
rolls with tissues.''
</P>
<P>
   From this, you could deduce that RadioMouse is made in China
even if half the manual wasn't printed in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, however, whatever causes the jams isn't related to
attached dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The manual also suggests a novel form of at-your-desk exercise:
``You may discover how easy it is to get comfortable, and enjoy
pointing your PC with freedom and convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, finally, is: Do we need this thing?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: Probably not, even if it worked smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds me of a contraption some outfit sent me years ago
that was intended to serve both as a mouse pad and as a kind of
tether for the cord to keep it from fighting you. The modern
Microsoft mouse seems to have a better cord; mine doesn't give me
any trouble at all. I'm perfectly happy with it, and it doesn't
need batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The only real need I can see for a wireless mouse is a situation
in which you're so far from your CPU unit that the mouse cord won't
reach. Then it might be a viable alternative to an extension cable
on the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you feel a wireless mouse would serve you best, you
can learn more about the RadioMouse at:
</P>
<P>
   www.cordlessmouse.com/
</P>
<P>
   It costs $40 _ batteries included.

 &HT;    As prices drop, once-fancy gadgets become the norm
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was thinking about pocket calculators the other day. I
remembered, back in the 1970s, saving up about $400 to buy a
Hewlett-Packard calculator. It was an amazing device then. It could
add, multiply and divide, as well as do all sorts of math problems
that would have made my high school trig teacher proud.
</P>
<P>
   It was a marvel of the time _ all that power packed into a gizmo
small enough to fit into my jacket pocket. Nowadays, of course, you
can find more powerful pocket calculators for $4 hanging in those
little shrink-wrap packages as you stand in the grocery store
checkout line.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the real marvels of technology _ how prices drop
so fast. Think of any gadget you care to mention _ microwave oven,
VCR, color television _ and, if you are old enough, you'll be
struck by how expensive it once was and how cheap it is now. While
prices for cars, houses and T-shirts have zoomed up over the years,
gadget prices invariably have dropped.
</P>
<P>
   That's what's happening now with PCs. Sure, I know it's been
going on for a while, but, I promise, you haven't seen anything
yet. As the technology is refined, as the size of the market grows,
and as manufacturing costs drop, PC prices will follow the same
script as my pocket calculator. Someday soon, PCs will be so cheap
that even people like me with ordinary incomes won't think twice
about buying a new one on a whim.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, AMD _ a big competitor to Intel in the
microprocessor market (those are the chips that are the brains
behind a computer) _ announced price cuts of up to 45 percent. AMD
had to do it because it is the sort of company that stakes its
fortune on selling chips for less than Intel. And Intel has dropped
prices itself, as well as doing a great marketing job with its
excellent but lower-priced Celeron chip.
</P>
<P>
   The price drops alone are a big deal and worth marveling about.
But I think the real impact of all this is going to be the way it
changes how we use computers. When the world changes, it seldom is
because of just one event. It's usually a combination of related
events. And as prices for PCs have dropped, using the Internet has
become easy and affordable, too. Most of us have Internet
connections at work and at home, and, without really thinking about
it, we've shifted a lot of our ordinary lives (ordering books,
chatting with friends, checking the weather) to the Net and to PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who know me as a techno-dinosaur, a man afraid of
some of the ways the Internet and computers have muscled in on our
lives, may be surprised by what I think about this coming change.
</P>
<P>
   I think that, as computers and the Internet become as ordinary
as clock radios and the morning news on TV, we may finally put it
all in perspective. Up to now, we have treated the cyber-world as a
magical place with different rules. Just as earlier social critics
worried television and radio would tear apart the fabric of
society, we've had the same worries _ me especially _ about this
new cyber-world.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying, by the way, that the worries were foolish.
Remember how Orson Welles' ``War of the Worlds'' broadcast created
panic? When the public puts magical belief in a medium, the power
of it becomes real. It has been the same with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But I believe that as technology becomes a routine part of life
_ as radio did _ we may begin to treat cyberspace and the Internet
as we treat television and radio. The message will become the
important thing, not the medium that carries the message. The magic
will go away, but the power will stay.
</P>
<P>
   So while the good news is that prices are dropping, I think the
even better news is that computers and the Internet are poised to
become just another excellent way of dealing with information.

 &HT;    The pride of Zoo Atlanta
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My name is Zulu, and I'm an 8-year-old African lion who lives at
Zoo Atlanta. You might remember my 1 1/2-year-old cub, Kariba, who
was in News For Kids a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever touched the rough tongue of a pet cat? My tongue
is like that _ after all, lions are big cats _ but much bigger,
rougher and
</P>
<P>
   stronger. I use it to clean my fur and to pull meat from bones.
I could take the skin off a human hand with two licks. (Which is
one reason they keep me in a secure pen at the zoo!)
</P>
<P>
   Here's more about me:
</P>
<P>
   My scientific name: Panthera leo.
</P>
<P>
   What I eat: Meat. At Zoo Atlanta, it's fed to me. If I were in
Africa, I'd eat gazelles, zebras, crocodiles and many other
animals. Sometimes lions even eat animals as big as hippopotamuses!
</P>
<P>
   How lions live: In the wild, we live in ``prides,'' or groups of
four to more than 30 lions, sharing food. Female lions usually
catch the animals we eat. They stalk their prey until the last
second, then try to run it down in a sprint. Many times the animal
gets away, and the lioness must try again. Male lions like me don't
hunt very much, but we protect the pride from outsider lions.
</P>
<P>
   How long lions live: In the wild, many lions die as cubs, and
adults often perish by age 10, from attacks by people, other lions
or prey animals. In zoos, where they're protected from such
attacks, they can live to 25 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   A cool thing about me: My roar, which in Africa would help me
communicate with my pride and scare away other lions, can be heard
up to five miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Another cool thing: In captivity, lions have sometimes mated
with tigers. The cub of a male lion and a female tiger is a called
a ``liger.'' The cub of a female lion and male tiger is called a
``tigon.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental note: Lions aren't endangered species, but our
numbers have declined because people have taken over many of the
places where we used to live.

 &HT;    IQ to I-Ching, favorite sites brighten the day
 &HT;    CYBERSCENE column
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For people who spend most of their working day and some of their
personal time connected to the Internet, the Web becomes part of
the daily routine.
</P>
<P>
   Just as someone who travels a lot in the real world _ the place
where it rains and the sun shines _ get to know the territory,
those of us who spend half our waking hours in cyberspace get to
know the lay of the land, as well.
</P>
<P>
   We have sites that are part of our practical everyday working
life. For instance, I check the weather by zapping over to the
Weather Channel (weather.com); or for looking up a street address,
e-mail address, or phone number go to Switchboard
(www.switchboard.com), or to find the best way to get to a business
across town use Yahoo!'s excellent mapping service
(/maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py).
</P>
<P>
   But over time, I've also found some places that just tickle me.
Just as a traveler might urge a friend to someday visit the
Petrified Forest or to plan a long week at the Grand Canyon, there
are some destinations that I like to recommend to my friends. Today
we'll talk about those favorite places.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have no notion in the world of just what our IQ is.
We know that it's an overrated way of measuring intelligence, but
yet there may be moments when you wonder just how smart you really
are. If you'd like a pretty good measuring stick on IQ, there's a
Web site that _ as nearly as I can tell _ produces reasonably
accurate results.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the Self-discovery Workshop and is at www.iqtest
</P>
<P>
   .com/welcometest.html. While at the page you can read a fairly
unbiased account of how IQ tests work.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can take, in just 18 minutes, an online version of the
IQ test. This isn't nearly as accurate as the kind of test you'd
pay hundreds of dollars to take, but _ based on the experiences of
some friends who had their IQ measured professionally _ the results
here are close enough to offer a rough gauge of how you'd test out.
</P>
<P>
   Since part of the test results are based on how much of the test
you complete in 18 minutes, make sure that you carve out at least
that much time for yourself if you decide to try the test. The nice
thing about taking an online test is that you can keep quiet if the
results horrify you. If, on the other hand, you wind up being an
undiscovered Einstein, then you can brag.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop on our tour is a site run by Bell Labs (the folks
who, among other things, brought you the transistor). It's located
at www.bell-labs.com
</P>
<P>
   /project/tts/.
</P>
<P>
   This particular part of the Bell Labs site deals with turning
computer text into synthesized human speech. While the notion of a
talking computer is no longer a novelty, the power of the program
demonstrated on this site is still impressive enough to bring a
smile. You can type in text, and then your computer will repeat it
back as spoken words.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, and this is my favorite of the bunch, there is a site
that uses the ancient fortunetelling technique called I-Ching on
the anything-but-ancient Web. Just go to this site at
www.iching.com/ and follow the directions.
</P>
<P>
   _ While you shouldn't use the advice you find here to start a
new life or decide what car to buy, it's a lot of fun and _
sometimes _ chillingly specific to the question that you ask.
</P>
<P>
   _ The site, by the way, is an advertisement for a program that
uses the same software you'll use online. But the Web version is so
good that you probably won't feel the need to buy the program, even
if you enjoy the experience.

<P>
   COXNET PTECH 0525 _ The computer does two things that make
genealogy simpler, more fun and more efficient: It organizes
records, and it links hobbyists through the Internet for the
exchange of ideas and information. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News)
Art includes one 4-column color illustration of a family tree on a
computer chip board.
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   TECH BRIEFS _ If your child has not taken to reading with the
same enthusiasm and skill as he has taken to video games, there's a
new Web site that might help. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) Art includes one 2-column color photo of a
Web site of Sylban Learning Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY _ Can we have some privacy? That's what folks will
tell you, if you ask about the fears they have of the Internet and
the Web. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) Art includes 1
column color sig of columnist.
</P>
<P>
   TRENDS _ Parents have mixed feelings about kids exploring the
Internet, according to a news study. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) Art includes one 1-column color illustration
of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   DOMAIN-NAMES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The process of registering a
domain name, which is simpler than it used to be, is still not as
effortless as it could be. But soon, it will be a little easier and
likely cheaper if a plan to include more registrars and add new
domain suffixes is successful. (Gallaga, Austin
American-Statesman). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY_ I was thinking about pocket calculators the other
day. I remembered, back in the 1970s, saving up about $400 to buy a
Hewlett Packard calculator. It was an amazing device then. It could
add, multiply and divide, as well as do all sort of math problems
that would have made my high school trig teacher proud. It was a
marvel of the time _ all that power packed into a gizmo small
enough to fit into my jacket pocket. Nowadays, of course, you can
find more powerful pocket calculators for $4 hanging in those
little shrinkwrap packages as you stand in the grocery store
checkout line. That's one of the real marvels of technology _ how
prices drop so fast. Think of any gadget you care to mention _
microwave oven, VCR, color television _ and, if you are old enough,
you'll be struck by how expensive it once was and how cheap it is
now. While prices for cars, houses and tee shirts have zoomed up
over the years, gadget prices invariably have dropped. (Husted,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHTOOLS _ We gather today to examine a thing called
RadioMouse. RadioMouse is not, as you might think, a mouse with an
AM-FM radio in it, although I'm sure that if one hasn't been
marketed it soon will be. Rather, RadioMouse is another wireless
mouse. It has this small distinction, at least: It's the first
wireless mouse I've tried. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
15. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH _ Web sites can help in tracing ancestors. (Katz,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE _ What's new on the Web. This week: For people who
spend most of their working day and some of their personal time
connected to the Internet, the Web becomes part of the daily
routine. Just as someone who travels a lot in the real world _ the
place where it rains and the sun shines _ get to know the
territory, those of us who spend half our waking hours in
cyberspace get to know the territory some. We have sites that are
part of our practical every day working life. For instance, I check
the weather by zapping over to The Weather Channel
(www.weather.com); or for looking up a street address, e-mail
address, or phone number go to Switchboard (www.switchboard.com),
or to find the best way to get to a business across town use
Yahoo!'s excellent mapping service (maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py).
(Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 17. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-MEDIA _ If you fear the Y2K bug, this may be the book for
you. ``Crisis Investing for the year 2000'' is a guide on how to
protect your finances if computers _ especially those on Wall
Street _ start to go haywire after midnight on Jan. 1. ``Preparing
yourself and your investments for Y2K is not the act of a fringe
survivalist,'' say authors L. Jay Kuo and Edward M. Dua in the
promotion blurb on the jacket of their book. ``Such measures are
the practical precautions of an informed realist.'' Here's some of
the authors predictions: Y2K will disrupt time-sensitive industries
such as banking and stock trading; Y2K will hurt companies
dependent on computer automation for making products and companies
dependent on overseas investments will be hurt because most
countries are ill-prepared for the millennium bug. (Haddad, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 14. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MAC-REPORT _ News on Apple and its products. This week: There
are some areas, dare I say it, in which the PC world commands a
lead over Apple Computer technology. One of the more significant is
voice-recognition software, a technology that Apple Computer once
pioneered. But Apple Computer is starting to close the gap, much to
the relief of many Mac users. (Haddad , Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-REPORT _ Tech briefs on new products and developments. This
week: How often has this happened: It's 8 p.m., you realize The
Nanny is a rerun and the Braves are on the West Coast. You flip
over to the A&AMP;E channel for relief only to find its ``Accounting
Giants Week'' on Biography. Now, A&AMP;E is giving you a chance to have
a hand in the occasional program selection. Biography is getting
interactive. Until June 1, people can type www.biography.com into
their Web browser and have a little say in what they see. Viewers
will pick the bios shown over the next several months. The
by-demand hour-long shows will start airing Monday, July 12, on the
8 p.m. A&AMP;E channel series. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 20. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   POWERUSER-COLUMN _ A regular series of columns for advanced
computer users. Not available this week: (Yandel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-GENEALOGY _ Once upon a time, if you wanted to research
your family tree, you had to travel from library to library. But
the Internet is making genealogy a hobby you can pursue from home,
with many resources now online. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). WITH
ILLUSTRATION. MOVED.WALKMAN-ANNIVERSARY _ As Sony celebrates the
30th anniversary of the personal stereo, the Walkman, it introduces
the MZ-R55 portable MiniDisc recorder/player. (Dayton Daily News).
6. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE-LYRICS _ Can a rock band be blamed for the deadly
actions of fervent fans? Of course. The finger-pointing has
happened time and again. But does that mean there's a provable
cause-and-effect relationship when a young fan goes over the edge?
The courts keep saying no. Everything that Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold listened to fell under societal scrutiny after they shot to
death 12 classmates and a teacher at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., and then killed themselves. Caught in the middle
of the controversy this time was Marilyn Manson. (Riemenschneider,
Austin American-Statesman). 40. WITH PHOTO ILLUSTRATION.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-SELFHELP _ Call it ``He Smirked, She Smirked.'' No longer
satisfied just to steal scenes, comedians Ben Stiller (''There's
Something About Mary'') and Janeane Garofolo (''The Larry Sanders
Show'') have taken a swipe at self-help books, relationship guides,
even the ubiquitous ``He Said, She Said'' columns in a new book
entitled ``Feel This Book.'' Taking turns discussing _ and dissing
_ each other and the other sex, the duo cover such essential topics
as compassion (''Is It Overrated?''), money (''How Can I Make it
Off My Spouse?'') and role playing (''I'm Not You and I Never Will
Be _ Thank God!'') We talk to Stiller and Garofolo. (Vejnoska,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.

 &HT;    NaturallySpeaking available soon
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some areas, dare I say it, the PC world commands a lead over
Apple Computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more significant is voice-recognition software, a
technology that Apple Computer pioneered.
</P>
<P>
   But Apple Computer is starting to close the gap, much to the
relief of many Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   At the company-sponsored Worldwide Developers conference two
weeks ago, interim chief executive Steve Jobs announced that Dragon
Systems will produce a Mac version of its NaturallySpeaking
software.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's NaturallySpeaking software is the leading
voice-recognition title in the United States. It enables computers
to translate conversational speech into text.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Dragon produced only a Windows version of
NaturallySpeaking. Now it will release a Mac version later this
year, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Macs have some limited voice-recognition capabilities through
their PlainTalk technology, which comes installed on most models.
PlainTalk, though, cannot translate conversational speech into
text.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Apple Computer has never had a Mac program that could
translate conversational speech. It hasn't been for a lack of
trying.
</P>
<P>
   The company had been working to enhance its voice technology
with a company called Articulate Systems Inc. But the two companies
couldn't get along, and Articulate pulled the plug on its Mac
offering, PowerSecretary, last year. Dragon Software, by the way,
owned a stake in Articulate.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dragon's Naturally- Speaking, released two years ago,
computers could only translate speech spoken unnaturally slowly and
clearly.
</P>
<P>
   NaturallySpeaking has created whole new uses for computers in
the past two years. Companies use it to take orders over the
telephone and provide automated customer support, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   And NaturallySpeaking is a wonderful alternative to people who
can no longer type because of repetitive stress injuries.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that NaturallySpeaking is perfect. Far from
it.
</P>
<P>
   NaturallySpeaking is a hog in terms of its requirements for disk
space and RAM. But the software is improving all the time with new
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon hasn't announced pricing or a brand name for its Mac
version of NaturallySpeaking. The Windows version, available in
several configurations, sells for between $200 and $700.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's Mac version of NaturallySpeaking also appears to be a
peace offering. It has battled with Apple Computer through the
years about voice-recognition technology patents. The two
companies, for example, have sued each other over the technology.

 &HT;    Web sites can help in tracing ancestors
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week I saw the places where my great-grandfather lived and
worked _ something I would not be able to do without the Web. For
me, the grandchild of Eastern European immigrants, learning about
my family history seemed nearly impossible. Finding bits of
information on the Web was a bit like shining a light in a dark
corner of my attic and finding unexpected treasures I didn't know
existed.
</P>
<P>
   I owe it all to Katie Couric. Well, actually, I owe it to the
entire anchor team of the ``Today'' show, who spent a week tracing
their respective family trees and posting lists of links to help
users get started in the job of researching their own families by
exploring on the MSNBC Web site.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Web sites that MSNBC had recommended were so
swamped by other novice genealogists like myself, it took a lot of
time for each page of requested information to load. Finally, I
just gave up and started looking for Web sites on my own, armed
with some of the links and suggestions that had been provided by
MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   I used to think that it would be impossible to trace my family
tree much past my grandparents, Morris and Fanny Katz, who came to
New York City in the early 1900s. Neither the Russians nor the
Nazis were much into keeping records of the Polish and Latvian
villages they plundered and destroyed in the first half of this
century.
</P>
<P>
   Even if I had the time and resources to travel to Europe to seek
out my family's records, I wouldn't know where to begin, because so
little is known about my great-grandparents. Making things even
worse are my family's many and conflicting oral histories. My
father has nine brothers and sisters who all tell different stories
about my grandparents and great-grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   So, although I am able to call up a wide variety of genealogy
sites and links on the Web, none of this stuff turned out to be of
much use to me, coming as I do from a family that can spend the
better part of a wedding reception _ as mine did once _ debating if
we really did have a Great Uncle Harry who absconded with the
family fortune and went to South Africa to strike it rich in the
diamond rush. The one thing everyone seems to agree on is where my
grandmother was born. It's a place called Slonim, which she said
was in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with just the name of a city in Poland, I began my search.
It was pretty discouraging at first. I tried searching for my
grandmother's maiden name but, since I didn't know quite how to
spell it, I had to rely on a ``sound-alike'' search engine that
couldn't come up with anything even close. After about a month of
searching nearly every genealogy site there I could find, I was
depressed and frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Before giving up entirely, I decided to call up one of the
search engines and type ``Slonim'' in the search field. I nearly
fell over when I found 71 sites. The reason I couldn't find Slonim
was now clear. After World War II,
</P>
<P>
   Slonim became part of the Soviet province of Belarus. More
searching led me to the homepage of a British genealogist whose
family had come from Slonim and who maintained a Web site devoted
to his family history. He included a page called ``The Ledger of
Slonim.''
</P>
<P>
   I discovered my grandmother's hometown had encouraged Jewish
immigrants who were escaping from the Crusades to settle there as
early as 1388. From all indications, it appears that Jews began
their settlement in Slonim that same year. The Web site describes
the prosperity of the city from the Renaissance through the late
1800s. There was also a page of pictures of libraries, synagogues
and other buildings my grandmother and her parents may have
frequented.
</P>
<P>
   The site also describes the anti-Semitic arson attacks on Jewish
homes and businesses. My great-grandfather's comb-and-brush factory
was burnt to the ground in one of these pogroms. That was when my
grandmother was given just enough money to go to America out of
harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   When my grandmother left Slonim in the 1900s, there were about
12,000 Jews living there. After the Germans took Slonim from the
Russians during World War II, the Jewish population dwindled to
zero, where it remains today. Further investigation, all done on
the Web, uncovered first-person accounts of life in Slonim after my
family had left and efforts of the Belarussian government to
restore the libraries and synagogues destroyed by previous
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for my family tree involved using what you could call
``the other Internet.'' So many people think of the Web as a
utility, something used for commercial or practical purposes. Along
with established commercial sites, there is a wealth of information
that will never make a dime or the Media Metrix top 10. But to
scholars, students and family tree-hunters like me, they are every
bit as valuable.

   SCHOOL VIOLENCE
</P>
<P>
   Teen wounds 6 students
</P>
<P>
   A student opened fire in a Georgia school last week, exactly one
month after the attack at Columbine High School in Colorado. Police
said a 15-year-old boy wounded six of his classmates at Heritage
High School in Conyers, about 20 miles east of downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The student brought two guns into the school and began shooting
before the first bell. Friends said he was upset because his
girlfriend had broken up with him. He was charged with aggravated
assault and will probably appear in court today.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was the sixth mass shooting at an American high
school or middle school since October 1997.

   ISRAEL
</P>
<P>
   New leader elected
</P>
<P>
   Israelis last week elected Ehud Barak to be their new prime
minister. Now he has 45 days to bring together members of the
Israeli parliament to support his programs. The members who agree
to support Barak's policies will make up his multi-party, or
``coalition,'' government.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he wants a coalition ranging greatly in beliefs.
``When there is a broad government, the public can more easily
accept decisions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has pledged to make peace in the area. Israel is a Jewish
nation, which has fought for years with surrounding Arab countries,
whose residents are mostly Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   MOTORCYCLE MANIA
</P>
<P>
   Daredevil jumps canyon
</P>
<P>
   Motorcycle daredevil Robbie Knievel jumped 228 feet over a
sliver of the Grand Canyon last week. He broke his own world record
for a motorcycle jump by 5 feet. Fireworks erupted and a crowd of
several hundred cheered as he soared over the 200-foot-wide gorge
at 90 mph on an ordinary 500cc motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   If he failed, Knievel could have plunged 2,500 feet to the
canyon floor.
</P>
<P>
   Knievel was going to attempt the jump on April 29, but it was
canceled at the last minute because of wind and cold. Knievel said
his daredevil father, Evel Knievel, had wanted to jump the Grand
Canyon but never got the chance.

<P>
   LIVING HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   Trees with a past
</P>
<P>
   Kids across the country can own a descendent of one of the last
trees planted by Johnny Appleseed.
</P>
<P>
   Appleseed, whose real name was John Chapman, planted many trees
in the early 1800s. He died in 1845 at age 71.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Meyer took cuttings from the wood and roots of an Ohio tree
planted by Appleseed before its recent death. In his greenhouse, he
grew thousands of saplings from the cuttings.
</P>
<P>
   You can get one of the saplings for $35, plus shipping, by
calling 800-320-TREE or by surfing to www.americanforests.org. The
proceeds go to American Forests, a nonprofit group that promotes
tree planting and preserves historic trees.

 &HT;    Software, Internet make tracing family tree easier
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene and Janice James of Riverside, Ohio had been interested in
the histories of their families for years, but Gene said they never
got deeply into the genealogy hobby until he retired around 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get started once or twice, but the record-keeping
and paper pushing was just horrendous,'' Gene James said. ``I
didn't have the time and patience for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Gene James is a dedicated hobby genealogist who has traced
his direct ancestry to the 17th century. And the tool that cut out
enough hassles for James to pursue the hobby is his home computer.
</P>
<P>
   James said the computer does two things that make genealogy
simpler, more fun and more efficient: It organizes records, and it
links hobbyists through the Internet for the exchange of ideas and
information.
</P>
<P>
   But unfortunately, the Internet is not the genealogy panacea
that some people believe. Genealogy experts like James and Carole
Medlar, genealogy librarian for the Dayton and Montgomery County
Public Library, say nothing can substitute yet for the hours people
spending looking through paper records for data about their
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who come in thinking they can find their
entire family tree on the Internet, but that's not usually true,''
Medlar said. ``That doesn't happen unless you stumble across
someone online who has gone to all the trouble before you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathering information
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in tracing your roots, a good place to
start is with your family members, according to James and Medlar.
And a key bit of information you need to have is where people
lived.
</P>
<P>
   James, for example, said his father left him a family tree with
names and dates relating to his ancestry. ``When I was starting out
I brought it to a woman who had been doing research, and she said
the things my father left me were exciting, but they weren't all
that useful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James was a civilian employee in the flight dynamics laboratory
before he retired, and he worked with computers 15 or 20 years
before retiring. He now writes a monthly column on computer
research for the newsletter of the local chapter of the Ohio
Genealogical Society.
</P>
<P>
   To get authoritative information on who was related to whom, a
researcher has to get to local records in the places their
ancestors were born, exchanged property, died and so on. In the
United States, most of the important records are kept at the county
level.
</P>
<P>
   A birth certificate on file in a county office with the names of
the parents and the child is an example of the kind of primary
source material that is tapped to produce a well-documented family
tree. Also important are marriage and death certificates, church
records, deeds and wills and old federal Census records.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar said only a fraction of that kind of information is
accessible directly through the Internet, but the Internet
computers at the public library are still a great resource for
genealogical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Researching genealogy has grown to be one of the top three
hobbies in the United States and the Internet does offer marvelous
support for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar said library patrons can log on to one of the library's
Internet computers to access databases with research information.
</P>
<P>
   One such database is the Social Security death benefit index,
she said. The online resource allows researchers to find the names
and dates people died and the names of people who received death
benefits after the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar said the library provides free access to some premium
reference databases. These are reference tools that normally carry
a subscription or per-use price, but the library pays the fees for
its patrons.
</P>
<P>
   If you're doing research on the Internet from home, the place
most people start is at cyndislist.com. Cyndi's List is a free site
managed by genealogist Cyndi Howell, and it contains links to
41,700 sites and archives.
</P>
<P>
   The sites include thousands of links to hobbyists who have
researched their family trees, and there's a chance you'll find
someone with common ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet resources, though, generally only provide clues
that point researchers to more traditional research avenues such as
county records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is all secondary data,'' James said. ``You can't
trust any of it as absolute.''
</P>
<P>
   The public library is a great source for noncomputer records.
For example, the Dayton library has microfilm Census records for
all Ohio counties through 1860 and for Montgomery County through
1920.
</P>
<P>
   The main branch of the Dayton library downtown has a genealogy
research section, and Medlar is on duty in the area from 2 to 6
p.m. Wednesdays. She's available at the reference desk on other
days.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar said even if researchers can pinpoint where to look for
old records, they usually have to review such records themselves to
get information. ``Usually county workers are busy doing county
work,'' she said. ``Going through old county records is not what
they're paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   James said he and his wife gather much of their information
while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't build our vacations around places we want to go to do
research,'' James said. ``But it's not unusual for us to stop for a
day on the way to going somewhere or on the way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizing information
</P>
<P>
   James said that where computers really shine is in compiling
data in a convenient form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working with the same piece of genealogy software
for the last nine years, and I still don't know all the things it
can do yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James said he keeps his genealogy records using a software
program called Brothers Keeper, but he said most of the programs on
the market cost about $15 to $45 and do basically the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   He said some popular programs include Family Tree Maker,
Ultimate Family Tree and Personal Ancestral File. To find reviews
of these programs and others, you can check the Genealogy Software
Springboard site at toltbbs.com/(tilde)kbasile/software.html.
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic types of interlinking records kept in
genealogy research.
</P>
<P>
   One is the ancestor shet that starts with an individual then
names that individual's parents, and the parents' parents, and the
grandparents' parents, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The other type of record is a family group sheet. It lists a
husband, wife and their offspring along with some details about the
family's personal history.
</P>
<P>
   James said genealogy software allows the researcher to enter
data in a simple format. The software maintains the links between
people that have been entered into the system, and it helps the
researcher manipulate the data into useful forms.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the software packages allow the researcher to enter
notes on the people whose names are listed. Some also store photos
connected with records.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people go back a few generations and they stop trying
to go further and further back,'' James said. ``Instead they get
into researching details about their ancestors' lives. They're more
interested in what their ancestors did day to day than in anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   James said he's primarily been interested in tracing his direct
ancestors back as far as possible. So far he's traced his line back
eight generations to a man named David James who was born in 1660,
probably in Cardiff, Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Just including direct ancestors only going back eight
generations involves recording information on 256 people. And
James, who is still filling gaps in his direct lineage, also has
records of siblings and multiple marriages that make his database
even more complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would have been able to keep all this straight without
a computer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When James goes to a county office, cemetery or library to look
up information about his family, he doesn't take a notepad and
pencil like old fashioned genealogists. He takes a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Online exchanges
</P>
<P>
   In addition to record-keeping, James said computers are most
useful in linking researchers to other researchers via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days before the Internet your chances of finding
somebody else working on your family tree would be almost nil,'' he
said. ``Now it happens all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   James said his wife's maiden name was Allenduff and in 1800,
there were records for only two people with that name in the United
States. ``Nobody knows where they came from,'' he said. ``They
could have been dropped out of a spaceship.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with such a small family, James has found four people
online researching the Allenduff ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   He's found even more people researching the James lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The further you go back, the more direct ancestors you have,''
James explained. ``And the more direct ancestors you know about,
the better the chances are that some other direct descendant is
doing research, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Resources like Cyndi's List provide a way for people doing
research on their family trees to let the world know what they're
doing. And it's common for researchers to cross paths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard greeting is 'Hi, Cousin!' when you hear from a
relative you didn't know you had,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   He said researchers do more than chat when they meet on line;
they also exchange data.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, James said if he found a relative working on
James family history he and the relative would print out their
family tree records and send them in a big envelope.
</P>
<P>
   Now he said it's possible to send records electronically. Most
genealogy software programs are able to convert information into a
standard format that can be shared by other software programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in the last week a relative sent me an e-mail that had
data on 200 people in an attachment,'' he said. ``Every year you do
more exchanges and you send more data electronically.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, James doesn't just dump information from other
researchers into his own database without checking out the new
information first. ``It's source material just like everything
else. It gives you new information to look into.''
</P>
<P>
   James also said exchanging information via e-mail has its
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful with the information you send on living
people,'' he said. ``Things like mother's maiden name, for example.
Do you realize how often mother's maiden name and information like
that is used as a security check? You don't want to spread
information that someone could use to steal someone else's
identity.''

 &HT;    RadioMouse works, but who needs it?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox Ndews Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We gather today to examine a thing called RadioMouse.
</P>
<P>
   RadioMouse is not, as you might think, a mouse with an AM-FM
radio in it, although I'm sure that if one hasn't been marketed it
soon will be.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, RadioMouse is another wireless mouse.
</P>
<P>
   It has this small distinction, at least: It's the first wireless
mouse I've tried.
</P>
<P>
   RadioMouse is a two-button affair of a fairly conventional
humpback style, made rather heavy by the three AAA batteries it
requires. It is smaller than the Microsoft mouse to which I am
accustomed, and I do not find it as comfortable, but that may be a
matter of habit.
</P>
<P>
   The receiver is a small plastic box with a cord that attaches to
the mouse port. It can sit just about anywhere on the desk; it
doesn't seem to require being right in front of the mouse pad.
According to the manual, it can be six to 10 feet from the
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   That, basically, is all there is to RadioMouse. There isn't any
software; it is entirely plug-and-play and in my case, at least,
worked automatically with the Microsoft drivers already installed.
</P>
<P>
   The radio connection appears to work quite well.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the mouse itself. The
buttons are too sensitive, resulting in unwanted right-button
clicks. The ball and rollers have a tendency to lock up, as if
dirty.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the manual warns that ``Mouse ball is easy to attach
dirt and causes malfunction. Clean mouse ball and the two rolling
rolls with tissues.''
</P>
<P>
   From this, you could deduce that RadioMouse is made in China
even if half the manual wasn't printed in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, however, whatever causes the jams isn't related to
attached dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The manual also suggests a novel form of at-your-desk exercise:
``You may discover how easy it is to get comfortable, and enjoy
pointing your PC with freedom and convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, finally, is: Do we need this thing?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: Probably not, even if it worked smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds me of a contraption some outfit sent me years ago
that was intended to serve both as a mouse pad and as a kind of
tether for the cord to keep it from fighting you. The modern
Microsoft mouse seems to have a better cord; mine doesn't give me
any trouble at all. I'm perfectly happy with it, and it doesn't
need batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The only real need I can see for a wireless mouse is a situation
in which you're so far from your CPU unit that the mouse cord won't
reach. Then it might be a viable alternative to an extension cable
on the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you feel a wireless mouse would serve you best, you
can learn more about the RadioMouse at:
</P>
<P>
   www.cordlessmouse.com/
</P>
<P>
   It costs $40 _ batteries included.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ Two hundred years ago our forefathers also
needed guns to hunt for food and keep wild animals at bay. Today
the wild animals are carrying the guns and the rest of us feel like
ducks in a shooting gallery. Is this what happens to an armed
society when there are no longer any common causes to rally around?

communal existence of an apartment dweller for the open spaces of
house life. I like doing laundry without going outside. I miss the
Coke machine, though. People told me I was moving to a quieter
existence, but mainly I traded one set of sounds for another.

<P>
   EDS: This is the CoxNet PTECH page for the current week. This
layout is available after 2 p.m. EDT on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   COXNET PTECH 0525 _ The computer does two things that make
genealogy simpler, more fun and more efficient: It organizes
records, and it links hobbyists through the Internet for the
exchange of ideas and information. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News)
Art includes one 4-column color illustration of a family tree on a
computer chip board.
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   TECH BRIEFS _ If your child has not taken to reading with the
same enthusiasm and skill as he has taken to video games, there's a
new Web site that might help. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) Art includes one 2-column color photo of a
Web site of Sylban Learning Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY _ Can we have some privacy? That's what folks will
tell you, if you ask about the fears they have of the Internet and
the Web. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) Art includes 1
column color sig of columnist.
</P>
<P>
   TRENDS _ Parents have mixed feelings about kids exploring the
Internet, according to a news study. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) Art includes one 1-column color illustration
of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   DOMAIN-NAMES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The process of registering a
domain name, which is simpler than it used to be, is still not as
effortless as it could be. But soon, it will be a little easier and
likely cheaper if a plan to include more registrars and add new
domain suffixes is successful. (Gallaga, Austin
American-Statesman). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY_ I was thinking about pocket calculators the other
day. I remembered, back in the 1970s, saving up about $400 to buy a
Hewlett Packard calculator. It was an amazing device then. It could
add, multiply and divide, as well as do all sort of math problems
that would have made my high school trig teacher proud. It was a
marvel of the time _ all that power packed into a gizmo small
enough to fit into my jacket pocket. Nowadays, of course, you can
find more powerful pocket calculators for $4 hanging in those
little shrinkwrap packages as you stand in the grocery store
checkout line. That's one of the real marvels of technology _ how
prices drop so fast. Think of any gadget you care to mention _
microwave oven, VCR, color television _ and, if you are old enough,
you'll be struck by how expensive it once was and how cheap it is
now. While prices for cars, houses and tee shirts have zoomed up
over the years, gadget prices invariably have dropped. (Husted,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHTOOLS _ We gather today to examine a thing called
RadioMouse. RadioMouse is not, as you might think, a mouse with an
AM-FM radio in it, although I'm sure that if one hasn't been
marketed it soon will be. Rather, RadioMouse is another wireless
mouse. It has this small distinction, at least: It's the first
wireless mouse I've tried. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
15. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH _ Web sites can help in tracing ancestors. (Katz,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE _ What's new on the Web. This week: For people who
spend most of their working day and some of their personal time
connected to the Internet, the Web becomes part of the daily
routine. Just as someone who travels a lot in the real world _ the
place where it rains and the sun shines _ get to know the
territory, those of us who spend half our waking hours in
cyberspace get to know the territory some. We have sites that are
part of our practical every day working life. For instance, I check
the weather by zapping over to The Weather Channel
(www.weather.com); or for looking up a street address, e-mail
address, or phone number go to Switchboard (www.switchboard.com),
or to find the best way to get to a business across town use
Yahoo!'s excellent mapping service (maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py).
(Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 17. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-MEDIA _ If you fear the Y2K bug, this may be the book for
you. ``Crisis Investing for the year 2000'' is a guide on how to
protect your finances if computers _ especially those on Wall
Street _ start to go haywire after midnight on Jan. 1. ``Preparing
yourself and your investments for Y2K is not the act of a fringe
survivalist,'' say authors L. Jay Kuo and Edward M. Dua in the
promotion blurb on the jacket of their book. ``Such measures are
the practical precautions of an informed realist.'' Here's some of
the authors predictions: Y2K will disrupt time-sensitive industries
such as banking and stock trading; Y2K will hurt companies
dependent on computer automation for making products and companies
dependent on overseas investments will be hurt because most
countries are ill-prepared for the millennium bug. (Haddad, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 14. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MAC-REPORT _ News on Apple and its products. This week: There
are some areas, dare I say it, in which the PC world commands a
lead over Apple Computer technology. One of the more significant is
voice-recognition software, a technology that Apple Computer once
pioneered. But Apple Computer is starting to close the gap, much to
the relief of many Mac users. (Haddad , Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-REPORT _ Tech briefs on new products and developments. This
week: How often has this happened: It's 8 p.m., you realize The
Nanny is a rerun and the Braves are on the West Coast. You flip
over to the A&AMP;E channel for relief only to find its ``Accounting
Giants Week'' on Biography. Now, A&AMP;E is giving you a chance to have
a hand in the occasional program selection. Biography is getting
interactive. Until June 1, people can type www.biography.com into
their Web browser and have a little say in what they see. Viewers
will pick the bios shown over the next several months. The
by-demand hour-long shows will start airing Monday, July 12, on the
8 p.m. A&AMP;E channel series. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 20. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   POWERUSER-COLUMN _ A regular series of columns for advanced
computer users. Not available this week: (Yandel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-GENEALOGY _ Once upon a time, if you wanted to research
your family tree, you had to travel from library to library. But
the Internet is making genealogy a hobby you can pursue from home,
with many resources now online. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). WITH
ILLUSTRATION. MOVED.WALKMAN-ANNIVERSARY _ As Sony celebrates the
30th anniversary of the personal stereo, the Walkman, it introduces
the MZ-R55 portable MiniDisc recorder/player. (Dayton Daily News).
6. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE-LYRICS _ Can a rock band be blamed for the deadly
actions of fervent fans? Of course. The finger-pointing has
happened time and again. But does that mean there's a provable
cause-and-effect relationship when a young fan goes over the edge?
The courts keep saying no. Everything that Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold listened to fell under societal scrutiny after they shot to
death 12 classmates and a teacher at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., and then killed themselves. Caught in the middle
of the controversy this time was Marilyn Manson. (Riemenschneider,
Austin American-Statesman). 40. WITH PHOTO ILLUSTRATION.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-SELFHELP _ Call it ``He Smirked, She Smirked.'' No longer
satisfied just to steal scenes, comedians Ben Stiller (''There's
Something About Mary'') and Janeane Garofolo (''The Larry Sanders
Show'') have taken a swipe at self-help books, relationship guides,
even the ubiquitous ``He Said, She Said'' columns in a new book
entitled ``Feel This Book.'' Taking turns discussing _ and dissing
_ each other and the other sex, the duo cover such essential topics
as compassion (''Is It Overrated?''), money (''How Can I Make it
Off My Spouse?'') and role playing (''I'm Not You and I Never Will
Be _ Thank God!'') We talk to Stiller and Garofolo. (Vejnoska,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.

   NFK-CHECKITOUT _ Flit and flutter Do you like to chase
butterflies? Before you trap that butterfly in your net, learn more
about these beautiful creatures on the Net at
www.mesc.usgs.gov/butterfly/butterfly.html. (Atlanta
Journal-Constitution ). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NFK-NEWSFLASH _ A student opened fire in a Georgia school last
week, exactly one month after the attack at Columbine High School
in Colorado. Police said a 15-year-old boy wounded six of his
classmates at Heritage High School in Conyers, about 20 miles east
of downtown Atlanta. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NFK-FEATURE _ My name is Zulu, and I'm an 8-year-old African
lion who lives at Zoo Atlanta. You might remember my 1 1/2-year-old
cub, Kariba, who was in News For Kids a few months ago. (Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED.

   BUSH-IOWA (Washington) _ In planning a presidential campaign, a
serious candidate must plot the ascent of Mount Yepsen. Gov. George
W. Bush is no different. Sometime during Bush's first, brief
campaign visit to Iowa next month, it's a good bet that the Texas
governor will seek to find time to make the climb. By CRAGG HINES.

   LAWMAKERS-WAGES (Albany, N.Y.) _ The new law that withholds New
York legislators' salaries until they approve a state budget has
been declared unconstitutional by a Brooklyn judge. But lawmakers,
who by now have missed their third paycheck, still will not see
their state wages until Gov. George Pataki has finished appealing
the court ruling. By LARA JAKES.
</P>
<P>
   HOSPITAL-MERGER (San Francisco) _ The 1997 merger of the medical
centers of the University of California at San Francisco and
Stanford University was supposed to save them from financial ruin,
but a stream of bad news has left many questioning the sales pitch
used to justify the deal. It has not shielded the hospitals from
the fiscal distress felt by academic medical centers nationwide. By

</P>
<P>
   SUTURES (San Francisco) _ A medical manufacturer retrieved only
2 percent of about 3.6 million surgical sutures it recalled after
the products allegedly were contaminated with infectious bacteria,
according to the Food and Drug Administration. Rep. Pete Stark,
D-Calif., says the FDA's handling of the nationwide recall of the
Ethicon Corp.'s trademark Vicryl surgical sutures _ and the low
return rate _ have made him fear that ``the system may have failed
to protect the health of patients.'' By LANCE WILLIAMS.

   ROCKWELL-OBIT (San Francisco) _ Alvin John Rockwell,_ a

   GADGETS (Undated) _ For those who like simple, elemental
furniture, check out the table in peopleplacesthings, one of

available in three styles, is a solid block of plantation-grown
Costa Rican cypress. It's primitive and purposeful _ proudly a

   ART-DISABLED (Oakland, Calif.) _ Regina Broussard is known for

   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)

<P>
   CYBER-BUSINESS (San Francisco) _ Electronic commerce still may

skeptics on the subject. Two of the latest voices heard come from
Thomas Siebel, founder and chairman of San Mateo-based business
software maker Siebel Systems Inc., and Pat House, executive vice

   VIDEOPHONES (San Francisco) _ Back in the '50s, visionaries knew
that global citizens would talk to one another on gleaming
videophones. But the fancy devices have never caught on. That may
be changing soon. The Kyocera Corp., based in Kyoto, Japan, has
announced the newest version of the device _ a mobile unit called
the Visual Phone VP-210, to be marketed initially in Japan. By JOHN

   INTERNET-BOOKS (Undated) _ If you haven't experienced books on
the Internet, check out Web locations sites where ``virtual books''

a boon to authors who, for whatever reason, eschew the traditional
road to publication in favor of (almost) instant gratification and
the opportunity to reach millions of readers. By JUDYTH RIGLER.

New Jersey company has designed smokeless indoor grills to make
barbecuing a timeless convenience. By FRANCES INGRAHAM.

   SUSHI-HEALTH (Albany, N.Y.) _ A New York statute that requires

<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Lately we've been reading about

profile of being African American, or Latino, the cops pull you
over on any pretext _ especially if you're driving in a white
neighborhood. I want to talk about something that hasn't come up

ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Offering people advice on how to
raise their kids is touchy. They tend to get annoyed.``Yeah, what

this: I raised two kids. I wasn't perfect at it. The kids weren't
perfect, either, believe me. They turned out pretty well, though.
By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Please don't misunderstand. I
am definitely not against progress. In many ways, the new
technologies which are nosing their way into everyday lives are
welcome and helpful. Still, all is not peaches and cream. Take, for
one example, the phone calls we get of an evening, usually after
supper. By HARRY ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ I have seen many advertisements

``friendly fire.'' A new, three-page ad for Nolvadex, the
anti-cancer drug tamoxifen, is one of them. By STEPHANIE SALTER.

JUNGLE FEVER: CUBA GOODING JR. PLAYS BY `INSTINCT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 Includes a color slide of Cuba Gooding Jr. with Anthony Hopkins in
a scene from ``Instinct.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Don't show him the money.
 &HT;    Just show him to a quiet table, a quiet back room, even a quiet
back door so Cuba Gooding Jr. can get away from the people who want
to hear The Line.
 &HT;    ``Say it,'' begs a teen-age boy in baggy jeans. ``You must say
it, man!''
 &HT;    ``Please say it,'' says a young woman on Michigan Avenue in
downtown Chicago. ``My friend over there is sick, and she would
feel better if you said it just once.''
 &HT;    Even at a local hamburger joint, the request swells to a general
chorus that even a determinedly low-profile Gooding can't ignore.
 &HT;    And give him this much, when the actor does anything, it's in a
big way.
 &HT;    Suddenly, he catapults up from a booth, his hips swiveling and
his head grooving to some imaginary beat.
 &HT;    ``Shoooow me the moonnn-aaaaay!'' he shrieks, and his fans burst
into applause,
 &HT;    Sure, a few older patrons look at him and clearly write him off
as another young guy who's obviously snapped. But everyone else
knows beyond a doubt that Cuba Gooding Jr. is in town.
 &HT;    Actually, Gooding says later as he relaxes in a luxury suite at
Chicago's Four Seasons Hotel, that was his character in ``Jerry
Maguire'' (1996). The actor himself doesn't need to be shown the
money.
 &HT;    ``I actually drive my agents crazy,'' he says, ``because they'll
want to negotiate a bigger salary for me on projects that I really
want to do. But if I get any resistance from the studio, I just
immediately go, `OK, fine. I'll take whatever they're offering me.'
 &HT;    ``The studios are willing to pay me big bucks to do an action
movie,'' Gooding adds, ``but I turn those down all the time. I
don't want the people who follow my movies to leave the theater
going, `He did that one for the cash!'''
 &HT;    So you know that it wasn't for the money that he signed on to
film ``Instinct,'' opening nationwide on June 4. Based on Daniel
Quinn's book ``Ishmael,'' the film casts him as a psychiatrist
assigned to evaluate a famous primatologist (Anthony Hopkins)
accused of ``going native,'' living among the gorillas he studies
and ultimately murdering two park rangers.
 &HT;    The money didn't enter into it, Gooding says. More important was
the chance to work with the Oscar-winning Hopkins ... and to redeem
himself in the British actor's eyes.
 &HT;    Wincing, he recalls their first meeting, at a 1997 industry
showcase.
 &HT;    ``It was so embarrassing,'' Gooding says, shaking his head.
``All I saw was the back of this bald head. Someone says to me,
`That's Tony Hopkins.' And I said, `Oh, no it's not. It's Lester
from the `Addams Family.'''
 &HT;    At which point, the man turned and gave him all the frost that
you'd expect from the eye of Sir Anthony Hopkins.
 &HT;    ``I gasped and said, `Oh, hello, Mr. Hopkins, nice to meet
you,''' Gooding adds. ``He wasn't mad for a moment, so I
impulsively wrapped my arms around him and gave him a big hug. Tony
then whispered to me, `So, kid, you're going to do that movie,
aren't you? The movie with the apes?'
 &HT;    ``I had no clue what he was talking about at the time.''
 &HT;    At that moment, the script for ``Instinct'' was lying amid a
pile that had flooded into his office since he had won a Best
Supporting Actor Oscar as football player Rod Tidwell in ``Jerry
Maguire.''
 &HT;    ``The Oscar was like this sonic boom,'' Gooding says. ``I went
from, `Oh, look, it's that guy from ``Boyz N the Hood''' to `Hey,
Cuba my man!'''
 &HT;    Since collecting his statuette, Gooding has put Jack Nicholson
in his place as a gay art dealer in ``As Good As It Gets'' (1997)
and toured heaven and hell with Robin Williams in ``What Dreams May
Come'' (1998), almost certainly the only film in which he'll ever
play Williams' son. He was even able to raise enough cash to
produce his first feature, ``A Murder of Crows,'' a thriller
starring Eric Stoltz that's due for release later this year.
 &HT;    And he's having fun, which should come as no surprise to anyone
who saw his exuberant acceptance speech at the Oscars. No one could
call him inhibited.
 &HT;    ``Cuba has no fear,'' Williams said during a ``What Dreams''
interview. ``What I love about him the most is that at the drop of
a hat he'll drop his trousers.''
 &HT;    Actually, yes. Even when the script calls for nudity, though _
as it does in one of his upcoming films _ Gooding can manage to
surprise people.
 &HT;    ``I had to do this really passionate love scene,'' he recalls,
bounding to his feet to set the scene. ``So I said, `Can I get the
whole crew in here, please?' I was really serious. I adjusted my
robe and I said, `Listen, this is a very big day. I don't want any
laughing.'
 &HT;    ``Then I dropped the robe,'' he says, deadpan. ``My assistant
had made this prosthetic penis _ he stuffed a stocking with
cellophane. Well, the whole crew cracked. The tension evaporated.
Afterward it didn't matter how long we were naked that day, it just
didn't matter.''
 &HT;    Gooding was 23 when he dazzled audiences in ``Boyz N the Hood''
(1991). He expected a major career to ensue, but few offers
appeared, and most of them were highly derivative of ``Boyz.''
 &HT;    ``I was offered dozens of inner-city movies, but I passed,'' he
says. ``I also didn't want to play the villain or the good-bad guy
_ I always wanted to be a leading man.''
 &HT;    Roles in ``Lightning Jack'' (1994) and ``Outbreak'' (1995) led
to an audition for ``Jerry Maguire'' _ opposite Robin Williams, who
briefly considered the title role that later went to Tom Cruise.
 &HT;    A year later, Gooding was thanking the Academy and his wife, a
teacher named Sara. The Goodings live in Los Angeles with their
sons, 5-year-old Spencer and 2-year-old Mason. They also have three
Great Danes _ Pitch Black, Woodrow and Lollipop.
 &HT;    A self-described ``homebody,'' Gooding says he isn't one for the
Hollywood circuit of parties and premieres.
 &HT;    ``A big night is Pay-Per-View,'' he says.
 &HT;    The other night, he adds, he even caught ``Jerry Maguire'' on
cable.
 &HT;    ``I immediately got caught up in it,'' the actor says. ``But
then I had to turn it off, because I started thinking, `That's the
best you're ever going to be.' I had to stop looking at it.''
 &HT;    He sighs.
 &HT;    ``Winning the Oscar is tricky,'' he says. ``It starts you off on
having internal dialogues you never thought you'd have.''
 &HT;    And besides, it can make you crazy after a while.
 &HT;    ``The only bad part of winning the Oscar,'' he adds, ``was that
I went home that night and my nanny had Spencer waiting on the
driveway. The minute I stepped out of the limo, the nanny was like,
`OK, say it to Daddy.' Spencer yawns and says, `Show me da money,
daddy.'
 &HT;    ``I looked at my nanny like, `I'll kill you!''' Gooding says,
laughing. ``I'm standing in my driveway screaming, `No, no, no!'''

 Includes a color slide of Martie Seidel, Emily Erwin and Natalie
Maines, the Dixie Chicks. 
 By BOB PAXMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    They're three women who dress like alternative-rock stars but
play a mixture of straight country, pop and bluegrass. They go by a
slightly tongue-in-cheek name, the Dixie Chicks.
 &HT;    In a word, they're so un-Nashville, yet the Dixie Chicks find
themselves ruling the country roost, and the Nashville
establishment has been forced to pay attention to them, like it or
not.
 &HT;    The Dixie Chicks _ fiddle player Martie Seidel,
multi-instrumentalist Emily Erwin and lead vocalist Natalie Maines
_ burst practically unknown onto the country scene in January 1998.
In little more than a year they've managed to ruffle the feathers
of normally placid Music Row _ which isn't that hard, but the
Chicks have gotten away with it, which is much rarer.
 &HT;    Their escape hatch, of course, has been popularity, which
translates into one thing that even Nashville can't ignore: money.
 &HT;    Their debut album, ``Wide Open Spaces,'' recently reached the 5
million sales mark. Its first single, ``I Can Love You Better,''
soared into the top 10, and the followups, ``There's Your Trouble''
and the album's title cut, both hit No. 1 on the country charts.
Country Music Association Awards and two Grammy Awards were simply
icing on the cake.
 &HT;    All this from virtually nowhere, leaving the country world
scratching its head and asking, ``Who are these women, and how are
they doing this?''
 &HT;    The look and the sound are both part of it, Erwin says.
 &HT;    ``Three women doing what we do is just so different in itself,''
says the tallest of the trio, who plays banjo, guitar, dobro and
mandolin. ``The fact that we play our own instruments has a lot to
do with our signature sound. People probably look at us playing
fiddles and banjos or whatever and think, `What are they doing up
there?'
 &HT;    ``But it's fun for us, and I think we are breaking a lot of
stereotypes.''
 &HT;    They've also latched onto a particular audience, mainly women in
their 20s _ as all three Chicks happen to be _ looking for feisty
role models. ``I Can Love You Better'' and ``There's Your Trouble''
embody a certain edginess without giving way to the anger that
seems to drive some other female pop acts.
 &HT;    ``We are a little partial to songs like that,'' Erwin agrees.
``There's a psychology behind it, you know, `You're seeing the
wrong one, buddy!' But we're just calling it like it is. People
like things in plain English.''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ``It reminds me of a lot of Tammy Wynette's songs,'' she adds.
``She was always saying, `Girl, get your head out of your
you-know-what,' and I loved her for that reason.''
 &HT;    Once you establish yourself in that vein, of course, you get
pitched similar songs by everyone with an ax to grind. And, yes,
the Chicks are getting more than their share.
 &HT;    ``We're getting piles and piles of `attitude' songs,'' Erwin
reports, chuckling. ``Guess there's an awful lot of 'tude out
there.
 &HT;    ``But that's not our M.O. at all,'' she says. ``The song `Wide
Open Spaces' has a lot of depth to it. `Once You've Loved Somebody'
is a great ballad. So there's no formula for a Chicks song _ if we
like it and we think we can put our harmonies to it, that's all we
need.''
 &HT;    Incidentally, the Chicks aren't really from Dixie. All three are
Texas natives, actually. Seidel and Erwin are sisters who were
already veterans of the music business by the time they _ and two
since-departed partners, Laura Lynch and Robin Macy _ founded the
Chicks in 1989.
 &HT;    The sisters got their first experience in six years of touring
the country as members of Blue Night Express, a teen bluegrass
group. The Chicks were officially hatched in an informal way, when
the four _ Seidel then 19 and Erwin 16 _ took their instruments to
a Dallas street corner and started playing for tips.
 &HT;    It wasn't meant as the start of something big, Seidel recalls,
but something clicked.
 &HT;    ``We knew there was something magical _ or at least lucrative _
about women playing music together,'' she says. ``The only problem
was we didn't have a name.''
 &HT;    Finding one wasn't easy, as the performers struggled for a tag
that they'd all go for. One morning, though, the answer came out of
thin air _ literally, since it was on the radio that they happened
to hear the Little Feat song ``Dixie Chicken.''
 &HT;    One syllable-extraction later _ Seidel didn't like the idea of
being a chicken _ they had a name.
 &HT;    But though they found ample bookings at clubs and dance halls
around Texas, the Chicks couldn't get any record companies
interested. It took six more years for the missing ingredient to
arrive, in the form of Maines.
 &HT;    The daughter of producer/musician Lloyd Maines, she'd heard the
band several times during her days as a college student in Lubbock,
Texas. Liking their style, she sent the sisters a demo tape in 1995
_ as it happened, just when the search was on for a replacement
Chick.
 &HT;    Seidel and Erwin admired not only Maines' voice, but also the
somewhat brazen personality she brought to her singing. Blonde and
brassy with a lilting soprano, Maines brought a Marilyn Monroe
spark to the Chicks' country style.
 &HT;    ``Our music evolved to this point once Natalie came in,'' Seidel
says. ``It took finding Natalie to make us say, `We've got
something.' That was the best thing that ever happened to Emily and
me.''
 &HT;    The band, now a trio, clicked almost immediately. And in 1997,
when Sony Music Entertainment decided to relaunch Monument Records,
former home to Roy Orbison and other country-pop legends, the first
act it signed was the Dixie Chicks.
 &HT;    The rest is, if not history, at least yesterday's news. Leaving
the obvious question, is there anywhere to go but down?
 &HT;    Unsurprisingly, the Chicks think their ride is only beginning.
 &HT;    ``One of our biggest goals is to write more of our own
material,'' Erwin says. ``Not long ago we went on a songwriter's
retreat outside Nashville and worked with all these great writers.
It was important for us to learn more about the craft of writing,
because we are new songwriters in relation to a lot of other
people.''
 &HT;    If you're wondering what sort of tunes the Chicks would write on
their own behalf, you won't have to wait long to find out.
 &HT;    ``We already have a handful of songs that we'll be recording for
our next album,'' Erwin reports.
 &HT;    That album, as yet untitled, is scheduled for release Aug. 31.
And the country-music world, which was generally skeptical about
the Chicks' chances as recently as a year ago, is predicting great
things.
 &HT;    Apparently the Dixie Chicks _ name, look and all-girl status
intact _ aren't the marketing problem that they once seemed.
Country audiences have a wider range of interest than many
observers had predicted, and the Chicks aren't ``too different'' to
succeed.
 &HT;    ``We heard a lot of that,'' Erwin admits.
 &HT;    In the end, she says, the marketing strategy wound up to be a
simple one _ let the Chicks be what they are.
 &HT;    ``We are not something that's been manufactured,'' she explains.
``We're real, we play our own instruments, which is kind of bizarre
to a lot of people. Maybe we were considered different or odd or
something _ but, you know, people who take the greatest chances
often make the greatest gains.
 &HT;    ``We tried to reinvent the wheel a million times, before
realizing what the essence of Dixie Chicks really is,'' she
concludes. ``Now we are definitely going to do this on our own
terms.''

 Includes a color slide of Saffron Burrows with Stefano Dionisi,
Rodney Charles and Julian Sands in a scene from ``The Loss of
Sexual Innocence.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Any minute now Saffron Burrows may find herself a movie star,
but if she ends up famous it won't be her fault.
 &HT;    ``It's undeniable that receiving a compliment from someone you
admire _ a friend, journalist, politician _ is a wonderful
feeling,'' the British actress says. ``But there's a very large
difference between that and the mad, mad, mad world of celebrity.
 &HT;    ``I've gotten a small taste of it, but I've seen it really
happen to people I know, and it can be scary and disorienting,''
she says. ``It's nothing I want for myself.''
 &HT;    The 26-year-old Burrows first generated buzz as the chic,
popular one of the three Irish friends in the surprise hit ``Circle
of Friends'' (1995). More recently she's juggled projects both
mainstream and offbeat, starring in the misbegotten big-screen
version of ``Wing Commander'' (1999) and in three upcoming films _
two of them the independent features ``The Loss of Sexual
Innocence'' and ``Miss Julie,'' the third a big-budget thriller,
``Deep Blue Sea.''
 &HT;    First up is ``Sexual Innocence,'' now in limited release.
Written and directed by Mike Figgis, the man behind ``Leaving Las
Vegas'' (1995), the movie explores various chapters in the life of
a filmmaker (Julian Sands), intercutting them with scenes depicting
the relationship between Adam and Eve. Burrows plays two
characters, twins raised in different countries.
 &HT;    Something of a cinematic curio, ``Sexual Innocence'' forgoes
standard storytelling structure, with images floating by like
thoughts. There are interracial relationships, violence and scenes
of child abuse, not to mention enough exposed flesh to make Hugh
Hefner blush.
 &HT;    ``I was immediately intrigued by the way Mike wrote it,'' says
Burrows, a tall, beautiful redhead, during an interview in the
Manhattan offices of the film's publicist. ``He broke all kinds of
screenwriting rules and popular myths, which made it liberating to
read.
 &HT;    ``I love films, but am rather disappointed by what's out there
at the moment,'' she says. ``So much of it is inane and often
doesn't require any intelligence at all to take in.
 &HT;    ``You just sit there and let it wash over you. You can't do that
with this film.''
 &HT;    Burrows has seen the film with audiences in America, Germany,
France and Ireland, and she finds that it affects different people
in different ways.
 &HT;    ``It's amazing,'' she says. ``Everyone seems to have very
radical, polarized responses. I've seen people left with images in
their mind that they've embraced, with ideas they love or don't
agree with, that led to some kind of debate.
 &HT;    ``The film certainly inspires conversation, on the sexual and
physical level, on the level of race,'' she concludes. ``How often
does a film challenge you?''
 &HT;    It was a challenging film to make as well, especially for
Burrows, who for the first time was taking direction from Figgis,
her offscreen beau of two-plus years.
 &HT;    ``Whatever is going on privately, my sense is that you have to
behave with professionalism and with the same sense of respect and
cooperation you would on any film,'' Burrows says, clearly
uncomfortable with the subject. ``You have to maintain that with
everyone and not tip the balance.
 &HT;    ``Mike was probably tougher on me than he might have been on
someone else,'' she adds. ``When you know people well, you're more
tough on them. And I was more tough on myself.''
 &HT;    During a separate conversation, Figgis sheds additional light on
the realities of mixing business and pleasure on the set.
 &HT;    ``You're much crueler,'' he says. ``In a working relationship
you've got to be seen as being much tougher on that person than you
would be on another actor.
 &HT;    ``You can't favor that actor, and you've got to push that actor
even more,'' he says. ``Saffron understood that. On the other hand,
you've got something that is quite personal, which is quite
fragile, too, and you don't want to squash that.''
 &HT;    Figgis stares at the ground.
 &HT;    ``It's f--king difficult,'' he says. ``You can't relax in that
relationship. The good news is that Saffron is really talented and
has a vibrancy that the camera captures, and it pays off. She'll
blow everybody away in `Miss Julie.'''
 &HT;    ``Miss Julie,'' also directed by Figgis, is an adaptation of
August Strindberg's classic stage drama. Shot in a mere three
weeks, ``Miss Julie'' stars Burrows as the title character, an
aristocrat in love with a commoner.
 &HT;    ``It stays very true to the play, but it's incredibly filmic,''
Burrows says. ``It's very literate, which scared investors and
distributors. Now, though, people are watching bits and pieces of
it and they're realizing that it's really a movie.
 &HT;    ``Hopefully people will get a chance to see it soon.''
 &HT;    One film that definitely won't have trouble finding a
distributor is the anything-but-highbrow ``Deep Blue Sea,'' opening
July 30. The Renny Harlin thriller offers genetically enhanced
sharks biting back at their creator (Burrows) and a group of
scientists (including Samuel L. Jackson, Stellan Skarsgard, Thomas
Jane and L.L. Cool J) after a tropical storm traps everyone on a
research rig adrift on the Pacific Ocean.
 &HT;    It's an unabashedly commercial undertaking, and Burrows makes no
apologies for that.
 &HT;    ``Big movies open doors, or they can if people go,'' she says.
``I wanted to do `Deep Blue Sea' because I was drawn to the cast.
`Deep Blue Sea' is a big studio movie with a big budget, but it had
more going for it, in my opinion, than most studio movies.''
 &HT;    Burrows has taken a different road to her event-movie debut than
the average model-turned-actress. Born in England, she modeled from
1988 until 1994, and _ unlike many former models _ she doesn't
knock the job, grateful for the money she earned and for the
freedom to travel and pursue her dream of acting.
 &HT;    ``For me, acting meant a chance to do something _ a film, a play
_ that could affect the way someone feels about an issue, be it
political or emotional, that could push you to go out and change
things,'' she says. ``That may sound very naive, but I was about 10
years old when I discovered the films of Ken Loach, and they had
such a profound impact on me.
 &HT;    ``I remember walking out of the cinema feeling very alive after
seeing his films,'' she says. ``I also remember being inspired by
Vanessa Redgrave after seeing her in a play. I thought, `What an
amazing marriage of activism and performing _ maybe I could do
that.'''
 &HT;    Redgrave recently turned 62, and in 1997 celebrated the 40th
anniversary of her stage debut. Still a relative newcomer, Burrows
finds it hard to imagine so long and prolific a career as
Redgrave's.
 &HT;    ``Wow,'' she says, nodding her head in thought. ``Forty years.
To be honest, I don't know.
 &HT;    ``I'd love to have a couple of kids,'' she says after a moment.
``I'd like to do so many things. I'd like to think that I'll still
be acting _ but even in a year, so much can happen in one's life.
 &HT;    ``I love what I'm doing now and I hope I'll always love it,''
she says. ``I just don't want to peak at the age of 26!''

<P>
   The original ``Star Trek'' _ and its hit successor, ``Star Trek:
The Next Generation'' _ had been built around a starship, the
legendary U.S.S. Enterprise. How exciting could this new,
determinedly stationary ``Star Trek'' series be, set aboard a space
station?
</P>
<P>
   Could anyone boldly go nowhere at all?
</P>
<P>
   As that first season progressed, however, it became apparent
that ``DS9'' wasn't so much an action-adventure series like its
predecessors _ it was more like a soap opera that just happened to
be set in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not about boldly going where no man has gone before,''
admits Armin Shimerman, who plays Quark, the opportunistic Ferengi.
``We were about boldly staying in one place. And because we stayed
in one place, we got to investigate the lives of the people on the
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did originally try to imitate `The Next Generation's'
format of one-stop adventures,'' Shimerman says, ``but our writers
soon realized it was more interesting to find out what made the
characters tick and seeing how they interrelated with other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nana Visitor, who has played the stern Bajoran, Col. Kira Nerys,
since that first season, agrees that this was an unusual ``Star
Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus was on the relationships between the characters,''
she says. ``I think it was the best thing we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Those onscreen relationships inevitably were reflected offscreen
as well, which made the taping of the final episode all the more
difficult. Shimerman called it ``a very emotional day,'' while Rene
Auberjonois, who plays stoic Security Officer Odo, reveals that a
pivotal scene in the final episode gathers all of the cast together
in the nightclub holosuite owned by Vic Fontaine (James Darren).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice that we spent that last day of shooting with all
of us situated at sort of a goodbye party,'' Auberjonois says. ``It
wasn't the last scene of the episode, but it was the last scene we
shot. That had a very nice feeling, because we were all there and
when we shot the last shot we all said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitor reports that she and her castmates took as long as they
possibly could to film those final few scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a bit of that last-day-of-school feeling _ no one
was going to behave very well,'' she says with a laugh. ``It was
emotional, and it was hard not to hug someone every two seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitor's emotional attachment to the series is probably greater
than that of most of the cast: She met her husband _ Alexander
Siddig, who plays the brilliant Dr. Julian Bashir _ on the set. At
the final taping, he was busy snapping behind-the-scenes photos for
their family album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are enough pictures for a whole album all by
itself,'' she says. ``And that's just that last day!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was no surprise to those involved that this would
be the show's final year. The entire cast and crew came into this
seventh season knowing that it would be their last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was the end back in July, when we started shooting
the current season,'' Shimerman says. ``It was sad in the sense
that something we had done for seven years was coming to an end.
For many of us it was the longest job we'd ever had as actors.''
</P>
<P>
   From an acting standpoint, the Broadway veteran says that the
final episode itself was an emotional event, but it was almost a
relief when the very last scene finally wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of like a great Thanksgiving feast that had gone
on for seven years,'' Auberjonois says. ``Everybody was stuffed to
the gills and satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though emotions ran high throughout the taping of the final
show, the true finality of the situation was felt only during the
private gathering held after the shoot was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one hell of a cast party,'' Shimerman says. ``We had a
wonderful time _ it was a beautiful night, people were all decked
out. There were a lot of tears, a lot of hugs, a lot of exchanging
of phone numbers. It was a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as details of the final episode itself are concerned,
Paramount is keeping them under heavy wraps. In fact, trying to pry
any specifics out of the cast is like trying to get Worf to smile.
Some snippets did emerge here and there, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first hour concentrates on the final, apocalyptic battle
between the Federation and the Dominion,'' Auberjonois says. ``The
second half will focus on the aftermath and the tying-up of all the
loose ends of all the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shimerman admits, the finale does leave some hanging
threads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the characters' loose ends will be resolved,'' he
says, ``but the major ones will be.''
</P>
<P>
   One scene in the closing minutes is sure to please devoted fans,
however. It's set in Quark's Bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that Quark closes up the bar and says `Last
call' to everybody,'' Shimerman says slyly. ``That's all I'm going
to give you.''
</P>
<P>
   To judge by Visitor's comments, however, the final episode may
not bode well for Col. Nerys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was upsetting to me when I read the script,'' the actress
says. ``It's not everybody's happy bye-bye. Things change ...
things definitely change.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast naturally hopes that fans will regard their final
outing as a fitting wrap-up for the series. But Auberjonois doesn't
promise that everyone will leave pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be spectacular, certainly,'' he says, ``but the truth
is, for the audience that has watched us for seven years and has
been passionate about the show, some will be thrilled while some
will be disappointed. You can't satisfy everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Deep Space Nine'' leaving the air, ``Star Trek: Voyager''
becomes the sole franchise representative on the air, the first
time in nearly eight years that only one ``Trek'' has been
available. But Trekkers shouldn't hold their breaths for a fourth
spinoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who work on `Star Trek' believe to some extent
that there has already been too much `Star Trek,''' Shimerman says,
sighing. ``And I personally would like that there not be another
one.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, infinite possibilities in Gene Roddenberry's
universe. The nine ``Star Trek'' films have earned nearly a billion
dollars since 1979. Could the silver screen be the next destination
for Capt. Sisko and the DS9 crew?
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'd love to think there would be a movie or
something for us after the series,'' Visitor says. ``That would be
wonderful.''

 Includes a color slide of Cuba Gooding Jr. with Anthony Hopkins in
a scene from ``Instinct.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Don't show him the money.
 &HT;    Just show him to a quiet table, a quiet back room, even a quiet
back door so Cuba Gooding Jr. can get away from the people who want
to hear The Line.
 &HT;    ``Say it,'' begs a teen-age boy in baggy jeans. ``You must say
it, man!''
 &HT;    ``Please say it,'' says a young woman on Michigan Avenue in
downtown Chicago. ``My friend over there is sick, and she would
feel better if you said it just once.''
 &HT;    Even at a local hamburger joint, the request swells to a general
chorus that even a determinedly low-profile Gooding can't ignore.
 &HT;    And give him this much, when the actor does anything, it's in a
big way.
 &HT;    Suddenly, he catapults up from a booth, his hips swiveling and
his head grooving to some imaginary beat.
 &HT;    ``Shoooow me the moonnn-aaaaay!'' he shrieks, and his fans burst
into applause,
 &HT;    Sure, a few older patrons look at him and clearly write him off
as another young guy who's obviously snapped. But everyone else
knows beyond a doubt that Cuba Gooding Jr. is in town.
 &HT;    Actually, Gooding says later as he relaxes in a luxury suite at
Chicago's Four Seasons Hotel, that was his character in ``Jerry
Maguire'' (1996). The actor himself doesn't need to be shown the
money.
 &HT;    ``I actually drive my agents crazy,'' he says, ``because they'll
want to negotiate a bigger salary for me on projects that I really
want to do. But if I get any resistance from the studio, I just
immediately go, `OK, fine. I'll take whatever they're offering me.'
 &HT;    ``The studios are willing to pay me big bucks to do an action
movie,'' Gooding adds, ``but I turn those down all the time. I
don't want the people who follow my movies to leave the theater
going, `He did that one for the cash!'''
 &HT;    So you know that it wasn't for the money that he signed on to
film ``Instinct,'' opening nationwide on June 4. Based on Daniel
Quinn's book ``Ishmael,'' the film casts him as a psychiatrist
assigned to evaluate a famous primatologist (Anthony Hopkins)
accused of ``going native,'' living among the gorillas he studies
and ultimately murdering two park rangers.
 &HT;    The money didn't enter into it, Gooding says. More important was
the chance to work with the Oscar-winning Hopkins ... and to redeem
himself in the British actor's eyes.
 &HT;    Wincing, he recalls their first meeting, at a 1997 industry
showcase.
 &HT;    ``It was so embarrassing,'' Gooding says, shaking his head.
``All I saw was the back of this bald head. Someone says to me,
`That's Tony Hopkins.' And I said, `Oh, no it's not. It's Lester
from the `Addams Family.'''
 &HT;    At which point, the man turned and gave him all the frost that
you'd expect from the eye of Sir Anthony Hopkins.
 &HT;    ``I gasped and said, `Oh, hello, Mr. Hopkins, nice to meet
you,''' Gooding adds. ``He wasn't mad for a moment, so I
impulsively wrapped my arms around him and gave him a big hug. Tony
then whispered to me, `So, kid, you're going to do that movie,
aren't you? The movie with the apes?'
 &HT;    ``I had no clue what he was talking about at the time.''
 &HT;    At that moment, the script for ``Instinct'' was lying amid a
pile that had flooded into his office since he had won a Best
Supporting Actor Oscar as football player Rod Tidwell in ``Jerry
Maguire.''
 &HT;    ``The Oscar was like this sonic boom,'' Gooding says. ``I went
from, `Oh, look, it's that guy from ``Boyz N the Hood''' to `Hey,
Cuba my man!'''
 &HT;    Since collecting his statuette, Gooding has put Jack Nicholson
in his place as a gay art dealer in ``As Good As It Gets'' (1997)
and toured heaven and hell with Robin Williams in ``What Dreams May
Come'' (1998), almost certainly the only film in which he'll ever
play Williams' son. He was even able to raise enough cash to
produce his first feature, ``A Murder of Crows,'' a thriller
starring Eric Stoltz that's due for release later this year.
 &HT;    And he's having fun, which should come as no surprise to anyone
who saw his exuberant acceptance speech at the Oscars. No one could
call him inhibited.
 &HT;    ``Cuba has no fear,'' Williams said during a ``What Dreams''
interview. ``What I love about him the most is that at the drop of
a hat he'll drop his trousers.''
 &HT;    Actually, yes. Even when the script calls for nudity, though _
as it does in one of his upcoming films _ Gooding can manage to
surprise people.
 &HT;    ``I had to do this really passionate love scene,'' he recalls,
bounding to his feet to set the scene. ``So I said, `Can I get the
whole crew in here, please?' I was really serious. I adjusted my
robe and I said, `Listen, this is a very big day. I don't want any
laughing.'
 &HT;    ``Then I dropped the robe,'' he says, deadpan. ``My assistant
had made this prosthetic penis _ he stuffed a stocking with
cellophane. Well, the whole crew cracked. The tension evaporated.
Afterward it didn't matter how long we were naked that day, it just
didn't matter.''
 &HT;    Gooding was 23 when he dazzled audiences in ``Boyz N the Hood''
(1991). He expected a major career to ensue, but few offers
appeared, and most of them were highly derivative of ``Boyz.''
 &HT;    ``I was offered dozens of inner-city movies, but I passed,'' he
says. ``I also didn't want to play the villain or the good-bad guy
_ I always wanted to be a leading man.''
 &HT;    Roles in ``Lightning Jack'' (1994) and ``Outbreak'' (1995) led
to an audition for ``Jerry Maguire'' _ opposite Robin Williams, who
briefly considered the title role that later went to Tom Cruise.
 &HT;    A year later, Gooding was thanking the Academy and his wife, a
teacher named Sara. The Goodings live in Los Angeles with their
sons, 5-year-old Spencer and 2-year-old Mason. They also have three
Great Danes _ Pitch Black, Woodrow and Lollipop.
 &HT;    A self-described ``homebody,'' Gooding says he isn't one for the
Hollywood circuit of parties and premieres.
 &HT;    ``A big night is Pay-Per-View,'' he says.
 &HT;    The other night, he adds, he even caught ``Jerry Maguire'' on
cable.
 &HT;    ``I immediately got caught up in it,'' the actor says. ``But
then I had to turn it off, because I started thinking, `That's the
best you're ever going to be.' I had to stop looking at it.''
 &HT;    He sighs.
 &HT;    ``Winning the Oscar is tricky,'' he says. ``It starts you off on
having internal dialogues you never thought you'd have.''
 &HT;    And besides, it can make you crazy after a while.
 &HT;    ``The only bad part of winning the Oscar,'' he adds, ``was that
I went home that night and my nanny had Spencer waiting on the
driveway. The minute I stepped out of the limo, the nanny was like,
`OK, say it to Daddy.' Spencer yawns and says, `Show me da money,
daddy.'
 &HT;    ``I looked at my nanny like, `I'll kill you!''' Gooding says,
laughing. ``I'm standing in my driveway screaming, `No, no, no!'''

WHISTLING DIXIE: HOW THE DIXIE CHICKS RUFFLED NASHVILLE'S
FEATHERS

 Includes a color slide of Martie Seidel, Emily Erwin and Natalie
Maines, the Dixie Chicks. 
 By BOB PAXMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    They're three women who dress like alternative-rock stars but
play a mixture of straight country, pop and bluegrass. They go by a
slightly tongue-in-cheek name, the Dixie Chicks.
 &HT;    In a word, they're so un-Nashville, yet the Dixie Chicks find
themselves ruling the country roost, and the Nashville
establishment has been forced to pay attention to them, like it or
not.
 &HT;    The Dixie Chicks _ fiddle player Martie Seidel,
multi-instrumentalist Emily Erwin and lead vocalist Natalie Maines
_ burst practically unknown onto the country scene in January 1998.
In little more than a year they've managed to ruffle the feathers
of normally placid Music Row _ which isn't that hard, but the
Chicks have gotten away with it, which is much rarer.
 &HT;    Their escape hatch, of course, has been popularity, which
translates into one thing that even Nashville can't ignore: money.
 &HT;    Their debut album, ``Wide Open Spaces,'' recently reached the 5
million sales mark. Its first single, ``I Can Love You Better,''
soared into the top 10, and the followups, ``There's Your Trouble''
and the album's title cut, both hit No. 1 on the country charts.
Country Music Association Awards and two Grammy Awards were simply
icing on the cake.
 &HT;    All this from virtually nowhere, leaving the country world
scratching its head and asking, ``Who are these women, and how are
they doing this?''
 &HT;    The look and the sound are both part of it, Erwin says.
 &HT;    ``Three women doing what we do is just so different in itself,''
says the tallest of the trio, who plays banjo, guitar, dobro and
mandolin. ``The fact that we play our own instruments has a lot to
do with our signature sound. People probably look at us playing
fiddles and banjos or whatever and think, `What are they doing up
there?'
 &HT;    ``But it's fun for us, and I think we are breaking a lot of
stereotypes.''
 &HT;    They've also latched onto a particular audience, mainly women in
their 20s _ as all three Chicks happen to be _ looking for feisty
role models. ``I Can Love You Better'' and ``There's Your Trouble''
embody a certain edginess without giving way to the anger that
seems to drive some other female pop acts.
 &HT;    ``We are a little partial to songs like that,'' Erwin agrees.
``There's a psychology behind it, you know, `You're seeing the
wrong one, buddy!' But we're just calling it like it is. People
like things in plain English.''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ``It reminds me of a lot of Tammy Wynette's songs,'' she adds.
``She was always saying, `Girl, get your head out of your
you-know-what,' and I loved her for that reason.''
 &HT;    Once you establish yourself in that vein, of course, you get
pitched similar songs by everyone with an ax to grind. And, yes,
the Chicks are getting more than their share.
 &HT;    ``We're getting piles and piles of `attitude' songs,'' Erwin
reports, chuckling. ``Guess there's an awful lot of 'tude out
there.
 &HT;    ``But that's not our M.O. at all,'' she says. ``The song `Wide
Open Spaces' has a lot of depth to it. `Once You've Loved Somebody'
is a great ballad. So there's no formula for a Chicks song _ if we
like it and we think we can put our harmonies to it, that's all we
need.''
 &HT;    Incidentally, the Chicks aren't really from Dixie. All three are
Texas natives, actually. Seidel and Erwin are sisters who were
already veterans of the music business by the time they _ and two
since-departed partners, Laura Lynch and Robin Macy _ founded the
Chicks in 1989.
 &HT;    The sisters got their first experience in six years of touring
the country as members of Blue Night Express, a teen bluegrass
group. The Chicks were officially hatched in an informal way, when
the four _ Seidel then 19 and Erwin 16 _ took their instruments to
a Dallas street corner and started playing for tips.
 &HT;    It wasn't meant as the start of something big, Seidel recalls,
but something clicked.
 &HT;    ``We knew there was something magical _ or at least lucrative _
about women playing music together,'' she says. ``The only problem
was we didn't have a name.''
 &HT;    Finding one wasn't easy, as the performers struggled for a tag
that they'd all go for. One morning, though, the answer came out of
thin air _ literally, since it was on the radio that they happened
to hear the Little Feat song ``Dixie Chicken.''
 &HT;    One syllable-extraction later _ Seidel didn't like the idea of
being a chicken _ they had a name.
 &HT;    But though they found ample bookings at clubs and dance halls
around Texas, the Chicks couldn't get any record companies
interested. It took six more years for the missing ingredient to
arrive, in the form of Maines.
 &HT;    The daughter of producer/musician Lloyd Maines, she'd heard the
band several times during her days as a college student in Lubbock,
Texas. Liking their style, she sent the sisters a demo tape in 1995
_ as it happened, just when the search was on for a replacement
Chick.
 &HT;    Seidel and Erwin admired not only Maines' voice, but also the
somewhat brazen personality she brought to her singing. Blonde and
brassy with a lilting soprano, Maines brought a Marilyn Monroe
spark to the Chicks' country style.
 &HT;    ``Our music evolved to this point once Natalie came in,'' Seidel
says. ``It took finding Natalie to make us say, `We've got
something.' That was the best thing that ever happened to Emily and
me.''
 &HT;    The band, now a trio, clicked almost immediately. And in 1997,
when Sony Music Entertainment decided to relaunch Monument Records,
former home to Roy Orbison and other country-pop legends, the first
act it signed was the Dixie Chicks.
 &HT;    The rest is, if not history, at least yesterday's news. Leaving
the obvious question, is there anywhere to go but down?
 &HT;    Unsurprisingly, the Chicks think their ride is only beginning.
 &HT;    ``One of our biggest goals is to write more of our own
material,'' Erwin says. ``Not long ago we went on a songwriter's
retreat outside Nashville and worked with all these great writers.
It was important for us to learn more about the craft of writing,
because we are new songwriters in relation to a lot of other
people.''
 &HT;    If you're wondering what sort of tunes the Chicks would write on
their own behalf, you won't have to wait long to find out.
 &HT;    ``We already have a handful of songs that we'll be recording for
our next album,'' Erwin reports.
 &HT;    That album, as yet untitled, is scheduled for release Aug. 31.
And the country-music world, which was generally skeptical about
the Chicks' chances as recently as a year ago, is predicting great
things.
 &HT;    Apparently the Dixie Chicks _ name, look and all-girl status
intact _ aren't the marketing problem that they once seemed.
Country audiences have a wider range of interest than many
observers had predicted, and the Chicks aren't ``too different'' to
succeed.
 &HT;    ``We heard a lot of that,'' Erwin admits.
 &HT;    In the end, she says, the marketing strategy wound up to be a
simple one _ let the Chicks be what they are.
 &HT;    ``We are not something that's been manufactured,'' she explains.
``We're real, we play our own instruments, which is kind of bizarre
to a lot of people. Maybe we were considered different or odd or
something _ but, you know, people who take the greatest chances
often make the greatest gains.
 &HT;    ``We tried to reinvent the wheel a million times, before
realizing what the essence of Dixie Chicks really is,'' she
concludes. ``Now we are definitely going to do this on our own
terms.''

Sexual Innocence.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Any minute now Saffron Burrows may find herself a movie star,
but if she ends up famous it won't be her fault.
 &HT;    ``It's undeniable that receiving a compliment from someone you
admire _ a friend, journalist, politician _ is a wonderful
feeling,'' the British actress says. ``But there's a very large
difference between that and the mad, mad, mad world of celebrity.
 &HT;    ``I've gotten a small taste of it, but I've seen it really
happen to people I know, and it can be scary and disorienting,''
she says. ``It's nothing I want for myself.''
 &HT;    The 26-year-old Burrows first generated buzz as the chic,
popular one of the three Irish friends in the surprise hit ``Circle
of Friends'' (1995). More recently she's juggled projects both
mainstream and offbeat, starring in the misbegotten big-screen
version of ``Wing Commander'' (1999) and in three upcoming films _
two of them the independent features ``The Loss of Sexual
Innocence'' and ``Miss Julie,'' the third a big-budget thriller,
``Deep Blue Sea.''
 &HT;    First up is ``Sexual Innocence,'' now in limited release.
Written and directed by Mike Figgis, the man behind ``Leaving Las
Vegas'' (1995), the movie explores various chapters in the life of
a filmmaker (Julian Sands), intercutting them with scenes depicting
the relationship between Adam and Eve. Burrows plays two
characters, twins raised in different countries.
 &HT;    Something of a cinematic curio, ``Sexual Innocence'' forgoes
standard storytelling structure, with images floating by like
thoughts. There are interracial relationships, violence and scenes
of child abuse, not to mention enough exposed flesh to make Hugh
Hefner blush.
 &HT;    ``I was immediately intrigued by the way Mike wrote it,'' says
Burrows, a tall, beautiful redhead, during an interview in the
Manhattan offices of the film's publicist. ``He broke all kinds of
screenwriting rules and popular myths, which made it liberating to
read.
 &HT;    ``I love films, but am rather disappointed by what's out there
at the moment,'' she says. ``So much of it is inane and often
doesn't require any intelligence at all to take in.
 &HT;    ``You just sit there and let it wash over you. You can't do that
with this film.''
 &HT;    Burrows has seen the film with audiences in America, Germany,
France and Ireland, and she finds that it affects different people
in different ways.
 &HT;    ``It's amazing,'' she says. ``Everyone seems to have very
radical, polarized responses. I've seen people left with images in
their mind that they've embraced, with ideas they love or don't
agree with, that led to some kind of debate.
 &HT;    ``The film certainly inspires conversation, on the sexual and
physical level, on the level of race,'' she concludes. ``How often
does a film challenge you?''
 &HT;    It was a challenging film to make as well, especially for
Burrows, who for the first time was taking direction from Figgis,
her offscreen beau of two-plus years.
 &HT;    ``Whatever is going on privately, my sense is that you have to
behave with professionalism and with the same sense of respect and
cooperation you would on any film,'' Burrows says, clearly
uncomfortable with the subject. ``You have to maintain that with
everyone and not tip the balance.
 &HT;    ``Mike was probably tougher on me than he might have been on
someone else,'' she adds. ``When you know people well, you're more
tough on them. And I was more tough on myself.''
 &HT;    During a separate conversation, Figgis sheds additional light on
the realities of mixing business and pleasure on the set.
 &HT;    ``You're much crueler,'' he says. ``In a working relationship
you've got to be seen as being much tougher on that person than you
would be on another actor.
 &HT;    ``You can't favor that actor, and you've got to push that actor
even more,'' he says. ``Saffron understood that. On the other hand,
you've got something that is quite personal, which is quite
fragile, too, and you don't want to squash that.''
 &HT;    Figgis stares at the ground.
 &HT;    ``It's f--king difficult,'' he says. ``You can't relax in that
relationship. The good news is that Saffron is really talented and
has a vibrancy that the camera captures, and it pays off. She'll
blow everybody away in `Miss Julie.'''
 &HT;    ``Miss Julie,'' also directed by Figgis, is an adaptation of
August Strindberg's classic stage drama. Shot in a mere three
weeks, ``Miss Julie'' stars Burrows as the title character, an
aristocrat in love with a commoner.
 &HT;    ``It stays very true to the play, but it's incredibly filmic,''
Burrows says. ``It's very literate, which scared investors and
distributors. Now, though, people are watching bits and pieces of
it and they're realizing that it's really a movie.
 &HT;    ``Hopefully people will get a chance to see it soon.''
 &HT;    One film that definitely won't have trouble finding a
distributor is the anything-but-highbrow ``Deep Blue Sea,'' opening
July 30. The Renny Harlin thriller offers genetically enhanced
sharks biting back at their creator (Burrows) and a group of
scientists (including Samuel L. Jackson, Stellan Skarsgard, Thomas
Jane and L.L. Cool J) after a tropical storm traps everyone on a
research rig adrift on the Pacific Ocean.
 &HT;    It's an unabashedly commercial undertaking, and Burrows makes no
apologies for that.
 &HT;    ``Big movies open doors, or they can if people go,'' she says.
``I wanted to do `Deep Blue Sea' because I was drawn to the cast.
`Deep Blue Sea' is a big studio movie with a big budget, but it had
more going for it, in my opinion, than most studio movies.''
 &HT;    Burrows has taken a different road to her event-movie debut than
the average model-turned-actress. Born in England, she modeled from
1988 until 1994, and _ unlike many former models _ she doesn't
knock the job, grateful for the money she earned and for the
freedom to travel and pursue her dream of acting.
 &HT;    ``For me, acting meant a chance to do something _ a film, a play
_ that could affect the way someone feels about an issue, be it
political or emotional, that could push you to go out and change
things,'' she says. ``That may sound very naive, but I was about 10
years old when I discovered the films of Ken Loach, and they had
such a profound impact on me.
 &HT;    ``I remember walking out of the cinema feeling very alive after
seeing his films,'' she says. ``I also remember being inspired by
Vanessa Redgrave after seeing her in a play. I thought, `What an
amazing marriage of activism and performing _ maybe I could do
that.'''
 &HT;    Redgrave recently turned 62, and in 1997 celebrated the 40th
anniversary of her stage debut. Still a relative newcomer, Burrows
finds it hard to imagine so long and prolific a career as
Redgrave's.
 &HT;    ``Wow,'' she says, nodding her head in thought. ``Forty years.
To be honest, I don't know.
 &HT;    ``I'd love to have a couple of kids,'' she says after a moment.
``I'd like to do so many things. I'd like to think that I'll still
be acting _ but even in a year, so much can happen in one's life.
 &HT;    ``I love what I'm doing now and I hope I'll always love it,''
she says. ``I just don't want to peak at the age of 26!''

 By BRIAN HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' premiered on January 4,
1993, critics gushed over its inventiveness, but fans were divided,
even worried.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Star Trek'' _ and its hit successor, ``Star Trek:
The Next Generation'' _ had been built around a starship, the
legendary U.S.S. Enterprise. How exciting could this new,
determinedly stationary ``Star Trek'' series be, set aboard a space
station?
</P>
<P>
   Could anyone boldly go nowhere at all?
</P>
<P>
   As that first season progressed, however, it became apparent
that ``DS9'' wasn't so much an action-adventure series like its
predecessors _ it was more like a soap opera that just happened to
be set in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not about boldly going where no man has gone before,''
admits Armin Shimerman, who plays Quark, the opportunistic Ferengi.
``We were about boldly staying in one place. And because we stayed
in one place, we got to investigate the lives of the people on the
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did originally try to imitate `The Next Generation's'
format of one-stop adventures,'' Shimerman says, ``but our writers
soon realized it was more interesting to find out what made the
characters tick and seeing how they interrelated with other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nana Visitor, who has played the stern Bajoran, Col. Kira Nerys,
since that first season, agrees that this was an unusual ``Star
Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus was on the relationships between the characters,''
she says. ``I think it was the best thing we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Those onscreen relationships inevitably were reflected offscreen
as well, which made the taping of the final episode all the more
difficult. Shimerman called it ``a very emotional day,'' while Rene
Auberjonois, who plays stoic Security Officer Odo, reveals that a
pivotal scene in the final episode gathers all of the cast together
in the nightclub holosuite owned by Vic Fontaine (James Darren).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice that we spent that last day of shooting with all
of us situated at sort of a goodbye party,'' Auberjonois says. ``It
wasn't the last scene of the episode, but it was the last scene we
shot. That had a very nice feeling, because we were all there and
when we shot the last shot we all said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitor reports that she and her castmates took as long as they
possibly could to film those final few scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a bit of that last-day-of-school feeling _ no one
was going to behave very well,'' she says with a laugh. ``It was
emotional, and it was hard not to hug someone every two seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitor's emotional attachment to the series is probably greater
than that of most of the cast: She met her husband _ Alexander
Siddig, who plays the brilliant Dr. Julian Bashir _ on the set. At
the final taping, he was busy snapping behind-the-scenes photos for
their family album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are enough pictures for a whole album all by
itself,'' she says. ``And that's just that last day!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was no surprise to those involved that this would
be the show's final year. The entire cast and crew came into this
seventh season knowing that it would be their last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was the end back in July, when we started shooting
the current season,'' Shimerman says. ``It was sad in the sense
that something we had done for seven years was coming to an end.
For many of us it was the longest job we'd ever had as actors.''
</P>
<P>
   From an acting standpoint, the Broadway veteran says that the
final episode itself was an emotional event, but it was almost a
relief when the very last scene finally wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of like a great Thanksgiving feast that had gone
on for seven years,'' Auberjonois says. ``Everybody was stuffed to
the gills and satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though emotions ran high throughout the taping of the final
show, the true finality of the situation was felt only during the
private gathering held after the shoot was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one hell of a cast party,'' Shimerman says. ``We had a
wonderful time _ it was a beautiful night, people were all decked
out. There were a lot of tears, a lot of hugs, a lot of exchanging
of phone numbers. It was a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as details of the final episode itself are concerned,
Paramount is keeping them under heavy wraps. In fact, trying to pry
any specifics out of the cast is like trying to get Worf to smile.
Some snippets did emerge here and there, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first hour concentrates on the final, apocalyptic battle
between the Federation and the Dominion,'' Auberjonois says. ``The
second half will focus on the aftermath and the tying-up of all the
loose ends of all the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shimerman admits, the finale does leave some hanging
threads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the characters' loose ends will be resolved,'' he
says, ``but the major ones will be.''
</P>
<P>
   One scene in the closing minutes is sure to please devoted fans,
however. It's set in Quark's Bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that Quark closes up the bar and says `Last
call' to everybody,'' Shimerman says slyly. ``That's all I'm going
to give you.''
</P>
<P>
   To judge by Visitor's comments, however, the final episode may
not bode well for Col. Nerys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was upsetting to me when I read the script,'' the actress
says. ``It's not everybody's happy bye-bye. Things change ...
things definitely change.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast naturally hopes that fans will regard their final
outing as a fitting wrap-up for the series. But Auberjonois doesn't
promise that everyone will leave pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be spectacular, certainly,'' he says, ``but the truth
is, for the audience that has watched us for seven years and has
been passionate about the show, some will be thrilled while some
will be disappointed. You can't satisfy everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Deep Space Nine'' leaving the air, ``Star Trek: Voyager''
becomes the sole franchise representative on the air, the first
time in nearly eight years that only one ``Trek'' has been
available. But Trekkers shouldn't hold their breaths for a fourth
spinoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who work on `Star Trek' believe to some extent
that there has already been too much `Star Trek,''' Shimerman says,
sighing. ``And I personally would like that there not be another
one.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, infinite possibilities in Gene Roddenberry's
universe. The nine ``Star Trek'' films have earned nearly a billion
dollars since 1979. Could the silver screen be the next destination
for Capt. Sisko and the DS9 crew?
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'd love to think there would be a movie or
something for us after the series,'' Visitor says. ``That would be
wonderful.''

DOES YOUR HIGH SCHOOL CLIQUE DEFINE YOU FOR LIFE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All of high school is a stage, a place where character is
developed and image is everything.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion of the crowd matters mightily. We cringe when they
throw tomatoes, become ecstatic in their applause.
</P>
<P>
   We assume roles, identifying with one group or another; the
brains, the nerds, the jocks, the freaks.
</P>
<P>
   When 12 students and a teacher were killed in an explosion of
violence at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., recently, we
were reminded how important image can be to teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, we define ourselves through our perception of
what others think of us,'' said James Hall, a psychologist with the
University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth.
``It's as if we are on stage and everyone is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, if we are cast out from the crowd, we join other
outcasts. Feeling superior, we decide the ``in'' crowd is the
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens everywhere, not just at Columbine High,'' Hall
said.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens when the curtain comes down on high school?
</P>
<P>
   Do we maintain the image we developed in school? Can we recover?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to shed the high school image if we go on to later
successes, Hall said. But for some, the wounds are deep. Outcasts
can become stuck in an emotional adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   So how do we rebound?
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few stories of high school experiences; some
miserable, some idyllic. All these folks, in spite of the role they
played in school, say they turned out OK. Here's how they did it:

<P>
   Foley High School, Foley, Ala., Class of 1969
</P>
<P>
   In high school: A groundbreaker
</P>
<P>
   In adult life: Director of the Fort Worth Public Library
</P>
<P>
   Gleniece Robinson, a self-described ``bold, brassy and
mischievous'' girl, was an academic achiever at an all-black school
in the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   So it was not surprising that she was among the first to
volunteer when the all-white Foley High School, southeast of
Mobile, Ala., was forced to desegregate.
</P>
<P>
   Automatically, she became an outcast at age 16. Instantly, an
unpopular girl. Robinson says she walked the two miles to school
every day rather than take the bus, where white students wouldn't
let her sit down.
</P>
<P>
   Her high-school experience taught her to cope with difficult
people, and ultimately, to become a better and stronger person, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is the newly hired director of the Fort Worth Public
Library, and an example of how to turn the horrors of high school
into adult success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned determination. I learned I could not allow other
people to turn me into a mean and hateful person,'' says Robinson,
who believes her high school years provided the drive to pursue a
college education and a career.

</P>
<P>
   Tulsa Memorial High School, Tulsa, Okla., Class of 1985
</P>
<P>
   In high school: Class clown
</P>
<P>
   In adult life: Professional comic
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to be the class clown forever?'' a teacher at
Tulsa Memorial High School once asked Dave Wilk.
</P>
<P>
   Probably so.
</P>
<P>
   Wilk says his high school image still follows him around. And is
he ever glad about that.
</P>
<P>
   Short, skinny and funny, Wilk chose to trade on the ``funny''
part early on, and it's paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Wilk was a high-school underachiever, intentionally so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played tennis, but I tried to stay ranked in the No. 7
position because the top six had to be on the team and compete,''
Wilk says. He didn't want to compete. He wanted to go bowling. Or
cruising.
</P>
<P>
   Wilk is a comic with Four-Day Weekend, an improvisational comedy
troupe that performs regularly at the Caravan of Dreams nightclub
in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   In April, he returned to Tulsa Memorial High School to do a
seminar on improv comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can say that I am going to be a clown, I'm going to be a
good clown, and you guys are gonna pay for my services,'' Wilk
says. ``I turned out OK because I followed my bliss.''

   PIPE. Holdover. 36. Far away in Alaska, when the pictures show
oil-soaked birds and a tanker leaking crude into the ocean, an
environmental disaster such as the Exxon Valdez will easily capture
the national limelight. Much closer to home, however, the potential
for another kind of petroleum disaster lurks underground, along
150,000 miles of pipelines that transport hazardous liquids through
such places as rural Atchison, Kansas. Ruptured lines can occur
anywhere, from Coffeyville, Kan., to Glasgow, Mo., to just outside
the nation's capitol in Washington. They may not get the publicity
of an Exxon Valdez, but pipeline breaks caused $54 million in
property damage last year in the U.S., and by one count spilled 7.7
million gallons of oil and other substances. The Environmental
Defense Fund calls that the worst toll in eight years, and charges
that federal regulators don't do nearly enough to prevent such
incidents. Pipeline companies say they still offer the safest way
to transport oil, and they're doing what they can, including the
use of ``smart pigs,'' instrument-laden devices that travel through
a line to detect possible problems. John L. Dvorak. Graphic.

   Michael Murry is a self-described overachiever.
</P>
<P>
   He was so in high school. He is so now.
</P>
<P>
   He set high goals and made sure he met them.
</P>
<P>
   Murry specializes in the psychological evaluations of juvenile
sex offenders and of parents accused of abuse and neglect, among
the most challenging branches of his field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adult identity doesn't suddenly start forming at age 18,''
Murry says.
</P>
<P>
   Who we will be when we grow up is something that gradually takes
shape over many years, including the high school years, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The high school years are crucial, so crucial that Murry rarely
agrees when parents tell him their teens are overly concerned with
status symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Murry says the right clothes and the hottest stuff help teens
establish their spot in the social pecking order, and there they
may stay, if for no other reason than self-fulfilling prophecy.

   The lesson from Mayor Kenneth Barr is this, although he didn't
exactly word it this way: More important than the creeps at school
are the people who are waiting at home. Family support helps set
values during our volatile teen-age years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a good student, but not an academic superstar,'' says
Barr, who launched his political career with a successful bid for
the high school student council. ``There was a group of friends I
ran around with all the time. We weren't always out to do good, but
we knew our limits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a family that had a commitment to putting me and my two
brothers on the right road. Too many kids today don't have adults
committed to them in that fashion.''

</P>
<P>
   From Jeff Ward, we can learn that there really are perks to
being a geek. Ward went to school in a coat and tie, even in the
late 1960s when everyone else was wearing bell-bottom jeans and
tie-dyed T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Life in a private school uniform automatically made one an
``elite geek,'' Ward says.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't all bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much peer pressure, mostly because there were few
peers,'' Ward says. He was in a graduating class of only eight
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so few of us, we didn't worry too much about image.
We didn't need to worry about standing out from the crowd,'' Ward
says.

   Ward went on to work in radio news, then computer programming,
and now owns a Fort Worth recording studio.

   Did life turn out perfectly for this superstar athlete who went

   No: Life seldom does.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Ric Nesbit's 16-year-old daughter, Katy, and her
classmate, Michael McEachern, 17, were shot to death in Fort Worth
by a juvenile male who stole McEachern's Ford Bronco and car
stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Nesbit went on to become the co-founder of the North Texas
Chapter of Parents of Murdered Children.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his daughter's murder, Nesbit's life was devoted to
teens and their struggle with identity.
</P>
<P>
   He started his career as a swimming coach, then switched to
counseling when he saw that as a more direct way to help kids.
</P>
<P>
   Nesbit tells his students that high school images don't have to
stick.
</P>
<P>
   The image adopted in high school is merely a protective
mechanism, he says. It helps adolescents feel the safety of
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Nesbit believes it's part of growing up to eventually abandon
those images, develop an individual personality, and be willing to
change.

NEW FASHION MAGAZINE AIMED AT CHRISTIAN WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEATHERFORD, Texas _ Michelle Toholsky, a former model and
Christian talk-show host, is publishing a new Christian women's
fashion magazine called Shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``From boot-scootin' to Bass Hall _ Fort Worth Has It All'' and
``30 Days to Swimsuit Lean'' are featured articles in the inaugural
edition of Shine, scheduled to appear in Christian bookstores this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping romance in a marriage, fashion advice, hair and makeup
tips, cooking innovations, a fitness column and devotional essays
about Christian life round out the first edition, according to
publisher Toholsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our magazine will focus on both inner and outer beauty and
show the joy of Christian living,'' said Toholsky, a mother of four
children.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Walsh, a former co-host on Pat Robertson's ``700 Club,''
is featured on the cover of the first issue. Walsh will be a
regular contributor to the magazine. Nancy Stafford, a former Ford
model who was a co-star of the ``Matlock'' television series, is
contributing a column on inner beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Doublemint Twins,'' chewing-gum commercial stars
Linda Ryan and Lisa Winters, will write about their Christian
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord has brought together some incredible people,''
Toholsky said. ``I couldn't have done it by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Toholsky said her goal was to find everyday women with everyday
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get women who were real, very down to earth and
could relate to all women,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Toholsky met Walsh several years ago on the ``700 Club''
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``She interviewed me because I was a Christian model who
wouldn't do certain things, such as appear in lingerie ads or
commercials for alcoholic beverages and cigarettes,'' Toholsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, David, an oil company representative based in Fort
Worth, said the magazine involves many of her family members. Other
family projects include a Christian retreat center in Springtown
and a program to feed the homeless in Fort Worth and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   One of the magazine's features, ``The Mom Connection,'' will be
written by Toholsky; her mother, Sandy Hormillosa; and her
grandmother, Ila Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   The three formerly hosted a radio talk show called ``The Mom
Connection'' on KTCY//104.9 FM. Efforts are under way to put the
program on local television, Toholsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents always tried to instill Christian values and a
sense of giving in all of my family members,'' Toholsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Toholsky says her father, Tony Hormillosa, has headed a program
called Heart for the Homeless on Dallas streets for 11 years. He
recently expanded the ministry to Fort Worth. Hormillosa collects
food from area restaurants and other sources and travels in a van,
giving out food.
</P>
<P>
   Single copies of the bimonthly magazine are $2.95. An annual
subscription is $17.95. More information can be obtained by calling
(817) 613-0188 or writing to Box 2493, Weatherford, TX 76086.
</P>
<P>
   Toholsky says most of the proceeds from the magazine will be
given to area charities, including the street ministry run by her
father.

SCHOOLS MAY BE SUED OVER STUDENT-TO-STUDENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ School systems around the country were put on
notice Monday that they must stop students from sexually harassing
their classmates or face the possibility of paying costly damages
to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that teachers and
school administrators who fail to stop student-to-student sexual
harassment may be violating a federal anti-bias law known as Title
IX.
</P>
<P>
   The court said a school district that accepts federal funding
can be held financially responsible for the sexual harassment of a
student if officials with the authority to help the child knew
about the harassment but were ``deliberately indifferent'' to it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the court said, the harassment must be so ``severe,
pervasive and objectively offensive'' that it prevents the victim
from learning or taking part in school activities.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' ruling was similar to a high court decision last
June that school districts can be held responsible when teachers
sexually harass students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recipients of federal funding may be liable for subjecting
their students to discrimination where the recipient is
deliberately indifferent to known acts of student-on-student sexual
harassment and the harasser is under the school's disciplinary
authority,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling reversed a 7-4 decision by 11th Circuit Court of
Appeals that Title IX never applies to student-on-student
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 bans sexual
discrimination in any educational institution that receives federal
money. The Supreme Court has long treated sexual harassment as a
form of illegal bias.
</P>
<P>
   The case centered around LaShonda Davis, who was a fifth-grade
student at Hubbard Elementary School in Forsyth, Ga., in the
1992-1993 school year.
</P>
<P>
   Over a five-month period, a classmate of LaShonda, known only as
G.F., made her life unbearable. Whenever the chance arose, he tried
to grab her breasts, rub against her in the hallway or say sexually
explicit remarks, such as he wanted ``get in bed'' with her. One
day, G.F., whose desk was next to LaShonda, put a doorstop in his
pants and gestured suggestively.
</P>
<P>
   LaShonda and her mother, Aurelia Davis, repeatedly told her
teacher about G.F.'s behavior. They were assured that the principal
had been informed and that something would be done to stop G.F. But
nothing was done, and G.F. continued to taunt and grope.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, LaShonda's mother went directly to the principal,
who said he would look into the matter. But again, nothing
happened.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Aurelia sued the Monroe County School Board in federal
court, claiming that teachers and school administrators had not
done enough to protect her child from sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, a U.S. District Court dismissed the Davis
lawsuit, saying, ``The sexually harassing behavior of a fellow
fifth-grader is not part of a school program or activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the 11th Circuit Court upheld that decision, ruling
that while Title IX authorizes suits for sexual harassment, its
coverage did not extend to harassment by one's peers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the appeals court's decision in the Davis case appeared
vulnerable after the Supreme Court's ruling last June. The high
court said then, also in a 5-4 decision, that monetary damages
could be granted if a school official who had authority to do
something about harassment of students by school employees ``has
actual notice of or is deliberately indifferent'' to the
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday O'Connor was joined in her opinion by Justices John
Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, Kennedy said, ``We can be assured that
like suits will follow _ suits, which in cost and number, will
impose serious financial burdens on local school districts, the
taxpayers who support them and the children they serve.''

EAT TWO COOKIES, AND CALL ME AN OLD LADY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be, doctors told you to take two aspirin and call in
the morning. My doctor suggested I eat a couple of cookies.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Signed in with the receptionist. Verified my address and
insurance carrier and took a seat in the waiting room. Nice waiting
room.
</P>
<P>
   You could twiddle your thumbs or read People magazine. I went
for the pamphlet on diabetes. Just the day before, I'd conferred
with the family hypochondriac and, medical manual in hand, decided
that's what I had. Not only does my sister Nancy suffer from it, so
does my mother's only surviving sibling, Aunt Eunice.
</P>
<P>
   I just wanted the doctor to confirm it and get rid of the sudden
dizzy spells I'd been experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse comes to the door and calls my name. I get up and
proceed to the scale. If ever there were a guarantee for bad news,
this is it.
</P>
<P>
   I weigh in at more than I ought to and head to the examining
room. It's nice, too. Cold. Bright. Sterile. I've already written a
check to cover my $10 co-pay. This is my room. I own it and the
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse takes my blood pressure. It's perfect. I'm a bit
surprised because this is the other ailment common to my family.
</P>
<P>
   Because I don't want to even think about being pregnant again,
that leaves just one thing. Diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor comes in and I describe my symptoms. I've been dizzy with
a little tingling in my lower extremities.
</P>
<P>
   He asks me if I had breakfast. I tell him I don't do breakfast.
Never have. Learned a long time ago that there were too many
wonderful foods to waste my time with breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   He tells me to eat something, anything, even if it's just a
couple of cookies, because if I'm waiting until lunch, it takes my
body about an hour to realize it's been at the trough.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I'm paraphrasing here.
</P>
<P>
   But these are his exact words. ``You're not as young as you used
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   What's this! I give him 10 bucks, he gives me five minutes,
insults me and leaves.
</P>
<P>
   I sulk until the nurse returns and draws blood. Just to be sure,
she tells me, they're going to check for a few things. That was on
Friday. Monday, the nurse tells me my glucose level is fine, even
my good and bad cholesterol are fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's perfect,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   I'm dumbfounded. Can't even get sick. And I'm old.
</P>
<P>
   I call the family hypochondriac and share my humiliation. She
repeats the symptoms noted in her medical journal. She suggests
getting a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Back at work, people are suspicious because I'm not going for
the chocolate. They think my radar is off. I explain I haven't been
feeling well and I thought I should cut back. Besides, I'm
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   They look at me in disbelief and ask where. I whisper my weight.
They still want to know where. I ask for sympathy. They laugh in my
face.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not what I used to be. The doctor says so, and hardly a day
passes that my daughters don't remind me how old I am.
</P>
<P>
   But what do they know? When I was 8 years old, I thought 41 was
ancient, too. Only I didn't automatically think that someone had
one foot in the grave because of it.
</P>
<P>
   My baby does. The other day she asked me if I missed my mother.
I told her yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, don't worry, Mommy,'' she says. ``You're old. You'll
probably be in heaven with her soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, and I'm going to eat chocolate chips all the way there.

WHERE HEATHER COULD SHARPEN HER CLAWS NEXT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having been a regular on ``Dynasty,'' ``T.J. Hooker'' and
``Melrose Place,'' as well as the lesser-known ``Going Places,''
Heather Locklear is fast becoming the feminine answer to Robert
Urich: a woman who can always find a TV show that will have her.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Melrose'' giving itself a big kiss-off Monday night,
Locklear is once again be free to explore her options. Here are
some shows we'd like to see her appear on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal'': The obvious choice. Heather shows up and tries
to outdo Ally in the micro-mini competition (no-weight division),
and makes life rough for Georgia, because she's played by
``Melrose'' alum Courtney Thorne-Smith and she's romantically
involved with a guy named Billy _ just like she was on ``Melrose!''
</P>
<P>
   ``General Hospital'': Heather wakes up from a coma to discover
that all seven seasons on ``Melrose'' were a dream, in an episode
that features the return of Frisco Jones (''Melrose's'' Jack
Wagner).
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'': Fox Mulder begins to suspect that Heather is a
siren with some sort of paranormal power over cheesy rock stars
such as Tommy Lee and Richie Sambora, leading them to fall for her.
Heather also tries to exert control over Dana Scully by giving her
some fashion sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``King of the Hill'': Heather appears as Hank's long-lost
city-girl cousin, who settles down in Arlen as a Mary Kay
saleswoman and stirs previously dormant longings in Bobby Hill. In
a lengthy subplot, Heather and Boomhauer begin dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawson's Creek'': Heather shakes things up as a new
schoolteacher who makes life interesting for the guys, miserable
for the girls, and nightmarish for her faculty colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends'': Heather threatens Chandler and Monica's
relationship when she takes a job as a waitress at Central Perk.
Joey and Ross also take an interest, but Joey's dumbness reminds
Heather too much of ``Melrose's'' Billy Campbell, and Ross' hair
gel reminds her too much of all the ``Melrose'' women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'': Heather does a series of L'Oreal commercials for
KACL (so it's radio, and these are hair commercials. Work with us,
OK?). Frasier, charmed by the symmetry of his ``I'm listening'' and
her ``I'm worth it'' begins a romance with Heather, can't believe
his luck, and then blows it with some ridiculous nitpick about how
her roots are showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'': Heather strikes up a romance with
the mayor of Sunnyvale, unaware that he's an invincible demon.
Buffy goes after her, mistakenly thinking that Heather is a
vampire. Alas, she's only a vamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diagnosis Murder'': Heather shows up on a show where the lead
is more than twice her age, and gives him a heart attack, in effect
canceling the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touched by an Angel'': The angels, having seen Heather's
antics on ``Dynasty'' and ``Melrose,'' try to make a better person
out of her. Encountering their first truly lost cause, they retire.

 &HT;    Can Music kill? Debate rages over roll of music in teen deaths
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a rock band be blamed for the deadly actions of fervent
fans? Of course. The finger-pointing has happened time and again.
But does that mean there's a provable cause-and-effect relationship
when a young fan goes over the edge?
</P>
<P>
   The courts keep saying no.
</P>
<P>
   Few people would deny that music influences those who listen the
closest, particularly teen-agers looking for life's answers amid
the emotional tug-of-wars of peers, parents and school.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Beatles lover Charles Manson told police the foursome's
``Helter Skelter'' inspired the Tate-LaBianca murders. In 1999,
everything that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold listened to fell
under societal scrutiny after they shot to death 12 classmates and
a teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., and then
killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle of the controversy this time was Marilyn
Manson (no relation to Charles). Already Public Enemy No. 1 in the
eyes of conservative family organizations, the ghoulish,
breast-clad shock-rocker's name came up repeatedly after the
Littleton shootings on talk shows, in newspaper editorials and on
the evening news. His ``Irresponsible Hate Anthem,'' with the lyric
``I am so all American, I'd sell you suicide,'' was cited as an
example of the messages being sent to teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Manson defended himself in a tersely worded statement two days
after the tragedy: ``The media has unfairly scapegoated the music
industry and so-called Goth kids and has speculated _ with no basis
in truth _ that artists like myself are in some way to blame. This
tragedy was a product of ignorance, hatred and an access to guns.''
</P>
<P>
   He canceled the last five concerts of his tour, including one in
Denver, but that didn't stop conservative organizations from going
after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you can't put the blame entirely on him,'' said Martin
Belforte, a representative from Austin's chapter of the American
Family Association. ``On the other hand, you can't ignore that he
glorifies suicide and hatred and endorses the idea that life has no
meaning. Everyone knows that music does have an influence on
teen-agers' attitudes, so what kind of an influence do you think he
has?''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Littleton tragedy, it appears that Manson had
very little, if any, influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus seems to be that (Harris and Klebold) didn't
even like Marilyn Manson,'' said Michael Mehle, pop music critic at
the Rocky Mountain News in Denver, citing the extensive work of
other reporters at the newspaper to verify a link. ``We stopped
mentioning him a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the campaign against the singer continues, as does
criticism of two lesser-known acts that the boys in Littleton did
like _ German industrial-rock bands KMFDM and Rammstein.
Investigators found scrawled lyrics from the bands that one of the
boys had written down.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Manson, whose lyrics are vaguely demonic and nihilistic
but rarely make any sense, KMFDM and Rammstein's songs are clearly
angry, aggressive and, yes, occasionally violent. One line in the
KMFDM song ``Piggybank'' goes, ``If I had a shotgun, I'd blow
myself to hell.'' Rammstein taped an MTV video full of shooting
scenes similar to the movie ``Reservoir Dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hitler-admiring gunmen apparently were attracted by the
bands' German heritage, although the musicians disavow any neo-Nazi
support.
</P>
<P>
   An art form
</P>
<P>
   ``KMFDM are an art form, not a political party,'' the group's
founder Sascha Konietzko said on the band's Web site. ``From the
beginning our music has been a statement against war, oppression,
fascism, and violence against each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Rammstein, meanwhile, didn't deny the violent overtones of its
music and especially its pyrotechnic-laden stage shows. The band's
statement read, ``We only show violence during our gigs and we make
it the subject of our lyrics. But we definitely refuse to practice
violence ... .'' Proving or disproving the influence of particular
bands in the Littleton shootings won't resolve the long-standing
debate over how to rein in music's powerful effect on young people.
With every new school shooting, like the one in the Atlanta suburb
of Conyers last week, questions will be asked about what kind of
music the gunman favored. (The recordings of the late rapper Tupac
Shakur was singled out in this latest case.)
</P>
<P>
   A similar critical crescendo sounded nine years ago over the
English heavy metal band Judas Priest. The band was sued by the
families of two fans, high-school dropouts who made a suicide pact
using a shotgun in Reno, Nev. One died and the other lived for
three years, but with facial deformations.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy-metal youth culture was put on trial. It was argued in
court, however, that the boys had seriously troubled upbringings.
Despite histories of drug abuse, physical abuse, clinical
depression and other signs of familial dysfunction _ plus, one of
the boys had just broken up with his girlfriend _ the parents
blamed Judas Priest for the suicide pact. The band's ``Stained
Class'' album was on the turntable at the time they shot
themselves, and it was said to include the subliminal message, ``Do
it! Do it!,'' recorded in a barely audible technique. The judge
left open the possibility of such subliminal messages being
considered harmful, but he didn't fault the band or the ``do-its''
in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Ozzy Osbourne, another English rocker, has fought three lawsuits
in which parents said his song ``Suicide Solution'' caused their
sons' suicides. The judges also sided with Osbourne in each case,
saying his music was protected under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Bands not guilty
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hemphill, a First Amendment lawyer in Austin, said it would
be difficult for any of the bands mentioned in the Littleton case
to be found guilty in a court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the proper court debate is whether or not music,
or art of any kind, can help cause a disturbed person to go over
the edge,'' said Hemphill. ``It can, we've all seen that. The
question is whether a band should be held responsible because a
disturbed fan does something tragic. So far, the court has said it
shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Hemphill helped represent Tupac Shakur and Interscope
Records, who were sued by the family of a state trooper killed near
Victoria by an 18-year-old man. The teen had been listening to
Shakur's ``2Pacalypse Now'' in his car before the shooting, and
claimed in his own criminal trial that the tape inspired him to
kill. The rapper and label, however, won the suit in a summary
judgment by U.S. District Court Judge John Rainey. Jurors in the
criminal trial gave the shooter the death penalty, deciding music
wasn't a mitigating factor in the murder.
</P>
<P>
   In the civil case, Judge Rainey wrote, ``At best, the recording
(`2Pacalypse Now') reveals that weak-willed individuals may be
influenced by Shakur's work. As the Supreme Court (has) explained,
swaying the weak-willed does not remove constitutional protection
from speech. ... The defendants cannot be responsible for
determining the mental condition of each and every potential
listener.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hemphill, ``All these cases, including the Colorado
shootings, are incredibly unsettling, so it's only right that
people try to find out what the heck is going on. ... But blaming
(the music) seems to be an overly simplistic solution to way more
complex problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Belforte at the American Family Association agrees, but he said
that doesn't mean Marilyn Manson and other rock acts shouldn't be
stopped, either through censorship or, more likely, through
boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   What do teens think?
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think parents should send the message that we don't
want this kind of dangerous music being sold to kids,'' Belforte
said. ``Like it or not, there are more and more teens with a
penchant for violence these days, and this kind of music simply
causes much more harm than it does good.''
</P>
<P>
   The oft-forgotten factor in this ongoing debate is what teens
themselves think. Among a dozen interviewed at the WherehouseMusic
store in South Austin last week, many were ambivalent to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't listen to any of those bands, so I don't really care
whether I can buy their CDs or not,'' said 17-year-old Trey
Crocker.
</P>
<P>
   The one shopper who did seem to care likes Manson's music. Tony
Melendez, 18, who owns two of Manson's CDs, said the singer and
others like him are getting a bad rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just rock music, you know,'' Melendez said. ``I know lots
of people who listen to it, and they've never gone out and shot
people. But then I've never known any kids who keep shotguns and
pipe bombs in their bedroom.''

CONFESSIONS OF A `MELROSE' FAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a certain point, ``Melrose Place'' was perfectly in sync with
the Zeitgeist. That point came in a mid-'90s ``Seinfeld'' episode
in which Jerry was revealed to be a closet ``Melrose'' watcher. It
led, as such things tended to on ``Seinfeld,'' to the downfall of a
relationship, but Jerry acknowledged that he had to watch because
he couldn't believe that the characters on ``Melrose'' did things
that were so stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry's disclosure came as comfort to many of us closet
``Melrose'' watchers. We're an odd lot. Many of us are reasonably
intelligent, artistically inclined, the type who think it's pretty
cool to live in an area that gets movies with subtitles. And yet
``Melrose,'' a show that featured mediocre-at-best actors playing
great-looking but shallow people doing incredibly stupid things ...
well, the show was addictive.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, anyway. Like most soap operas, ``Melrose''
eventually hit a point where it was chasing its creative tail. It
got to a point where it seemed that Heather Locklear's character,
Amanda Woodward, had dated every guy on the show except for Matt,
the gay character with a lousy love life. The show even made a joke
out of the serial romances in a recent episode, in which Thomas
Calabro's scheming Michael Mancini expresses his love for his
newest infatuation and then gives props to his wives, listing each
as an afterthought: ``Nothing against Jane ... or Sydney ... or
Kimberley ... or Megan ... or Jane again ... ''
</P>
<P>
   It was that self-aware sense of humor that kept us watching,
guilty as we felt about doing so. Calabro, probably the show's best
actor, playing Michael, its best character, once called the show a
comedy. Although the show had a certain hit-the-organ-chord
melodrama to it, he had a point _ ``Melrose'' often winked at the
viewer. It was stupid, but it had us hooked, even though we
couldn't figure out why nobody ever closed their Venetian blinds on
the show, why people always jumped to the worst possible
conclusions and why characters often married people who had once
tried to blow them up.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, jokes run out of gas if you tell them enough, and
``Melrose,'' like ``Seinfeld,'' told its jokes a few times too
many. Those of us who once watched it as a guilty pleasure drifted
away, only to come back out of curiosity as the show peters to its
end. You could call the show influential. You could say that
without it, we wouldn't have ``Ally McBeal,'' ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' or ``Charmed.'' You could say that, but ``Melrose'' never
meant itself to be taken even that seriously. And that's why we
watched.

DEPARTURE OF `HOME IMPROVEMENT,' `MAD ABOUT YOU' LEAVES VOID IN
SITCOM LAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How ironic that the series most likely to solve family squabbles
neatly and lovingly will leave the air in the midst of a
professional family falling-out. Viewers who have stayed with
``Home Improvement,'' which concludes its eight-year run Tuesday,
will find it odd that co-star Jonathan Taylor Thomas isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Why the actor decided to skip the final episode depends on
whether you're reading The Star, watching ``Inside Edition'' or
listening to co-star Patricia Richardson, who seems to spread the
blame across a number of quarters, including the actor's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me if this sounds unsympathetic, but this was exactly the
sort of friction this syrupy little series needed to change its rep
from the Mariah Carey of sitcoms _ a comedy that wouldn't be so
artificial had it borrowed even a bit from real life. (Judging from
the finale, however, it made little difference.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``Mad About You,'' the other series survivor
checking out this week after seven years, has come full circle,
delivering a final note that love and marriage is as glorious as it
is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional theory that the two sitcoms started out as
opposites _ ``Mad'' as the edgy, urban romantic comedy, ``Home'' as
the formulaic, suburban family sitcom _ and ended as dorky family
comedies doesn't really ring true.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, complaints that ``Mad'' had grown weary and repetitive
usually came from people who didn't seem to be actually watching
the show on a regular basis anymore.
</P>
<P>
   I know. I was one of them. But after watching a number of this
year's shows, I saw that the series had picked up steam rather
nicely, peaking with a few episodes that could stand with this
romantic comedy's best.
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell exactly where these sitcoms fall within the
lexicon of television culture, whether they said something of
significance or merely dissolved into the wasteland that's series
television.
</P>
<P>
   What's clear is that ``Home'' and ``Mad,'' both based on the
adage that you can't live without men and you can't kill them, seem
to be the last of their breeds.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, ``Home'' was a family show that played
shamelessly to everyone in the family. That made it an instant hit
with viewers and a complete bore to TV critics, many of whom found
its elements too easy to assemble. (In our cynical world, we now
consider ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' a family show, although the
kids are merely props.)
</P>
<P>
   Tim Allen's Tim Taylor was a master of macho madness, hammering
through 2-by-4s on his cable show and bantering with partner and
buddy Al (Richard Karn), always ridiculed because of his
``sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   At home with wife Jill (Richardson), and sons played by Thomas,
Taran Noah Smith and Zachery Ty Bryan, Tim was an aggressive
goof-up whose masculine pride frequently got him in trouble,
particularly with Jill, who wanted her boys to live a more cultured
life. (Thankfully they seemed to have turned out more like Jill
than Tim.)
</P>
<P>
   Next-door neighbor Wilson (Earl Hindman) appeared like clockwork
to mop up each Taylor mess. The running gag was that his character
never showed his entire face, always being blocked by the high
fence or other perfectly placed objects. It's the one area in which
``Home Improvement'' refused to kowtow to audience yearning.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's character was merely a domesticated version of his ``Men
Are Pigs'' stand-up act, about a modern man so confused about women
that he's reduced to beating his chest and making grunting noises.
I never could figure if those sounds were a gorilla flexing
territorial muscle or a baboon stuck in a trap.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Home'' was a clever vehicle for Allen's talents, partly
because he offered us a jerk we could enjoy guilt-free.
</P>
<P>
   But signing on Richardson was the clincher. Jill served as the
female counterpoint to Tim's male world. She was the intellectual
of the two, someone who looked beyond Tim's fascination with
machinery and the power that propels it.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Richardson said that it was always
important to her (though not necessarily to the writers, she noted)
that the relationship be balanced. It was Richardson who tried,
usually in vain, to take apart gender-related cliches, to show the
real ups and downs of marriage with children.
</P>
<P>
   She admits that far too many times, Tim got away with murder as
her character was asked to grin and bear it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this is also what ``Home'' shares with ``Mad'' _ female
co-stars talented enough to mask the shortcomings of their comedic
husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Much like Jill and Tim, Jamie (Helen Hunt) and Paul (Paul
Reiser) played yin off yang. The only difference was that they
often switched positions. The impulsive, neurotic Paul could be
driven insane by some trivial matter, only to be soothed by
cautious, calm Jamie. Later, Jamie is the neurotic impulsive being
consoled by rational Paul.

 (New York Times OpEd for release Sun., May 23)  
 c.1999 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We are in Kosovo with our allies to stand for a
Europe, within our reach for the first time, that is peaceful,
undivided and free. And we are there to stand against the greatest
remaining threat to that vision: instability in the Balkans, fueled
by a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not simply ethnic hatred, or even ethnic
conflict. The people of the former Yugoslavia have lived together
for centuries with greater and lesser degrees of conflict, but not
the constant ``cleansing'' of peoples from their land. Had they
experienced nothing but that, their nations would be homogenous
today, not endlessly diverse.
</P>
<P>
   The intolerable conditions the region finds itself in today are
the result of a decadelong campaign by Slobodan Milosevic to build
a greater Serbia by singling out whole peoples for destruction
because of their ethnicity and faith. The brutal methods are
familiar now. Spreading hate in the media. Killing moderate
leaders. Arming paramilitaries and ordering soldiers to conduct
planned campaigns of murder and expulsion. Eradicating the culture,
the heritage, the very record of the presence of his victims.
Refugees are not a byproduct of the fighting he has initiated; the
fighting is designed to create refugees. We are haunted by the
images of people driven from their homes, pushing the elderly in
wheelbarrows, telling stories of relatives murdered.
</P>
<P>
   We saw this for the first time in Croatia and in Bosnia. The
international community responded at first with a studied
neutrality that equated victims with aggressors; it followed with
diplomacy and the deployment of unarmed peacekeepers with the
mandate, but not the means, to protect civilians. By the time NATO
acted, 250,000 people were dead, more than two million displaced,
and many have still not returned. People will look back on Kosovo
and say that this time, because we acted soon and forcefully
enough, more lives were saved and the refugees all came home. The
Balkan conflict that began 10 years ago in Kosovo will have ended
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot respond to such tragedies everywhere, but when ethnic
conflict turns into ethnic cleansing where we can make a
difference, we must try, and that is clearly the case in Kosovo.
Had we faltered, the result would have been a moral and strategic
disaster. The Kosovars would have become a people without a
homeland, living in difficult conditions in some of the poorest
countries in Europe, overwhelming new democracies. The Balkan
conflict would have continued indefinitely, posing a risk of a
wider war and of continuing tensions with Russia. NATO itself would
have been discredited for failing to defend the very values that
give it meaning. Those who say Kosovo is too small to be of great
importance forget these simple facts.
</P>
<P>
   When the violence in Kosovo began in early 1998, we exhausted
every diplomatic avenue for a settlement. Last October, we
convinced Milosevic that he should withdraw some forces from Kosovo
and allow an unarmed international presence. That is the solution
advocates of compromise propose today. But it failed last fall.
Milosevic broke his promises, poured more troops into Kosovo,
poised for an offensive he had been planning for months. When it
began, we had to act.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's strategy has been to outlast us by dividing the
alliance. He has failed. Instead of disunity in Brussels, there are
growing signs of disaffection in Belgrade: Serbian soldiers
abandoning their posts, Serbian civilians protesting the policies
of their leader, young men avoiding conscription, prominent Serbs
calling on Milosevic to accept NATO's conditions. Meanwhile, our
air campaign has destroyed or damaged one-third of Serbia's armored
vehicles in Kosovo, half its artillery, most of its ability to
produce ammunition, all its capacity to refine fuel and done
enormous damage to other sectors of its economy. Though he has
driven hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians from their homes,
Milosevic has not eliminated the Kosovar Liberation Army. Indeed,
its ranks are swelling, and it has begun to go on the offensive
against Serb forces hunkered down to hide from air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Now Milosevic faces the certainty of continuing air strikes, the
persistence of the KLA and the prospect of having to answer to his
people for starting an unwinnable conflict that is bringing
military failure and economic ruin. The question now is not whether
his ethnic cleansing will be reversed, but when, and how much of
his military he is willing to see destroyed along the way.
</P>
<P>
   While I do not rule out other military options, we are pursuing
our present strategy for three reasons. First, and most important,
it is working and will succeed in meeting NATO's basic conditions
of restoring the Kosovars to their homes, with Serb forces out of
Kosovo and the deployment of an international security force. This
force must have NATO at its core, which means it must have NATO
command and control and NATO rules of engagement, with special
arrangements for non-NATO countries, just like our force in Bosnia.
Our military campaign will continue until these conditions are met,
not because we are stubborn or arbitrary, but because these are the
only conditions under which the refugees will go home in safety and
under which the KLA have any incentive to disarm _ the basic
requirements of a resolution that will work.
</P>
<P>
   Second, this strategy has broad and deep support in the
alliance, and allows us to meet our objectives. While there may be
differences in domestic circumstances, cultural ties to the Balkans
and ideas on tactics, there is no question about our unity on goals
and our will to prevail. I have worked hard to shape our present
consensus; 60 days into the air campaign, NATO is more unified on
Kosovo than it was at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Third, this strategy gives us the best opportunity to meet our
goals in a way that strengthens, not weakens, our fundamental
interest in a long-term, positive relationship with Russia. Russia
is now helping to work out a way for Belgrade to meet our
conditions. Russian troops should participate in the force that
will keep the peace in Kosovo, turning a source of tension into an
opportunity for cooperation, like our joint effort in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we must remember that the reversal of ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo is not sufficient to end ethnic conflict in the Balkans
and establish lasting stability. The European Union and the United
States must do for southeastern Europe what we did for Western
Europe after World War II and for Central Europe after the Cold
War. Freedom, respect for minority rights, and prosperity are
powerful forces for progress. They give people goals to work for;
they elevate hope over fear and tomorrow over yesterday. We can do
that by rebuilding struggling economies, encouraging trade and
investment and helping the nations of the region join NATO and the
European Union. Already, the region's democracies are responding to
the pull of integration by sticking with their reforms, taking in
refugees and supporting NATO's campaign. A democratic Serbia that
respects the rights of its people and its neighbors can and should
join them. If it does, we will help to restore it to its rightful
place as a European state in the Balkans, not a balkanized state at
the periphery of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans are not fated to be the heart of European darkness,
a region of bombed mosques, men and boys shot in the back, young
women raped, all traces of group and individual history rewritten
or erased. Just as leaders took their people down that road,
leaders must take them back to a better tomorrow. Ultimately, we
and our allies can help make this happen, if we stick with NATO's
campaign and follow through with a strategy to ensure that the
forces pulling southeastern Europe together are stronger than the
forces tearing it apart.

   WASHINGTON _ We are in Kosovo with our allies to stand for a
Europe, within our reach for the first time, that is peaceful,
undivided and free. And we are there to stand against the greatest
remaining threat to that vision: instability in the Balkans, fueled
by a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not simply ethnic hatred, or even ethnic
conflict. The people of the former Yugoslavia have lived together
for centuries with greater and lesser degrees of conflict, but not
the constant ``cleansing'' of peoples from their land. Had they
experienced nothing but that, their nations would be homogenous
today, not endlessly diverse.
</P>
<P>
   The intolerable conditions the region finds itself in today are
the result of a decadelong campaign by Slobodan Milosevic to build
a greater Serbia by singling out whole peoples for destruction
because of their ethnicity and faith. The brutal methods are
familiar now. Spreading hate in the media. Killing moderate
leaders. Arming paramilitaries and ordering soldiers to conduct
planned campaigns of murder and expulsion. Eradicating the culture,
the heritage, the very record of the presence of his victims.
Refugees are not a byproduct of the fighting he has initiated; the
fighting is designed to create refugees. We are haunted by the
images of people driven from their homes, pushing the elderly in
wheelbarrows, telling stories of relatives murdered.
</P>
<P>
   We saw this for the first time in Croatia and in Bosnia. The
international community responded at first with a studied
neutrality that equated victims with aggressors; it followed with
diplomacy and the deployment of unarmed peacekeepers with the
mandate, but not the means, to protect civilians. By the time NATO
acted, 250,000 people were dead, more than two million displaced,
and many have still not returned. People will look back on Kosovo
and say that this time, because we acted soon and forcefully
enough, more lives were saved and the refugees all came home. The
Balkan conflict that began 10 years ago in Kosovo will have ended
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot respond to such tragedies everywhere, but when ethnic
conflict turns into ethnic cleansing where we can make a
difference, we must try, and that is clearly the case in Kosovo.
Had we faltered, the result would have been a moral and strategic
disaster. The Kosovars would have become a people without a
homeland, living in difficult conditions in some of the poorest
countries in Europe, overwhelming new democracies. The Balkan
conflict would have continued indefinitely, posing a risk of a
wider war and of continuing tensions with Russia. NATO itself would
have been discredited for failing to defend the very values that
give it meaning. Those who say Kosovo is too small to be of great
importance forget these simple facts.
</P>
<P>
   When the violence in Kosovo began in early 1998, we exhausted
every diplomatic avenue for a settlement. Last October, we
convinced Milosevic that he should withdraw some forces from Kosovo
and allow an unarmed international presence. That is the solution
advocates of compromise propose today. But it failed last fall.
Milosevic broke his promises, poured more troops into Kosovo,
poised for an offensive he had been planning for months. When it
began, we had to act.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's strategy has been to outlast us by dividing the
alliance. He has failed. Instead of disunity in Brussels, there are
growing signs of disaffection in Belgrade: Serbian soldiers
abandoning their posts, Serbian civilians protesting the policies
of their leader, young men avoiding conscription, prominent Serbs
calling on Milosevic to accept NATO's conditions. Meanwhile, our
air campaign has destroyed or damaged one-third of Serbia's armored
vehicles in Kosovo, half its artillery, most of its ability to
produce ammunition, all its capacity to refine fuel and done
enormous damage to other sectors of its economy. Though he has
driven hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians from their homes,
Milosevic has not eliminated the Kosovar Liberation Army. Indeed,
its ranks are swelling, and it has begun to go on the offensive
against Serb forces hunkered down to hide from air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Now Milosevic faces the certainty of continuing air strikes, the
persistence of the KLA and the prospect of having to answer to his
people for starting an unwinnable conflict that is bringing
military failure and economic ruin. The question now is not whether
his ethnic cleansing will be reversed, but when, and how much of
his military he is willing to see destroyed along the way.
</P>
<P>
   While I do not rule out other military options, we are pursuing
our present strategy for three reasons. First, and most important,
it is working and will succeed in meeting NATO's basic conditions
of restoring the Kosovars to their homes, with Serb forces out of
Kosovo and the deployment of an international security force. This
force must have NATO at its core, which means it must have NATO
command and control and NATO rules of engagement, with special
arrangements for non-NATO countries, just like our force in Bosnia.
Our military campaign will continue until these conditions are met,
not because we are stubborn or arbitrary, but because these are the
only conditions under which the refugees will go home in safety and
under which the KLA have any incentive to disarm _ the basic
requirements of a resolution that will work.
</P>
<P>
   Second, this strategy has broad and deep support in the
alliance, and allows us to meet our objectives. While there may be
differences in domestic circumstances, cultural ties to the Balkans
and ideas on tactics, there is no question about our unity on goals
and our will to prevail. I have worked hard to shape our present
consensus; 60 days into the air campaign, NATO is more unified on
Kosovo than it was at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Third, this strategy gives us the best opportunity to meet our
goals in a way that strengthens, not weakens, our fundamental
interest in a long-term, positive relationship with Russia. Russia
is now helping to work out a way for Belgrade to meet our
conditions. Russian troops should participate in the force that
will keep the peace in Kosovo, turning a source of tension into an
opportunity for cooperation, like our joint effort in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we must remember that the reversal of ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo is not sufficient to end ethnic conflict in the Balkans
and establish lasting stability. The European Union and the United
States must do for southeastern Europe what we did for Western
Europe after World War II and for Central Europe after the Cold
War. Freedom, respect for minority rights, and prosperity are
powerful forces for progress. They give people goals to work for;
they elevate hope over fear and tomorrow over yesterday. We can do
that by rebuilding struggling economies, encouraging trade and
investment and helping the nations of the region join NATO and the
European Union. Already, the region's democracies are responding to
the pull of integration by sticking with their reforms, taking in
refugees and supporting NATO's campaign. A democratic Serbia that
respects the rights of its people and its neighbors can and should
join them. If it does, we will help to restore it to its rightful
place as a European state in the Balkans, not a balkanized state at
the periphery of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans are not fated to be the heart of European darkness,
a region of bombed mosques, men and boys shot in the back, young
women raped, all traces of group and individual history rewritten
or erased. Just as leaders took their people down that road,
leaders must take them back to a better tomorrow. Ultimately, we
and our allies can help make this happen, if we stick with NATO's
campaign and follow through with a strategy to ensure that the
forces pulling southeastern Europe together are stronger than the
forces tearing it apart.

UNDATED: rational Paul.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Hunt got to do what Richardson yearned for: To play half of
a wrinkled, flawed, real couple at a time when television considers
three episodes a long-term relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Each season we have another romantic comedy contender (at least
three come up this fall), but none has been able to do it right. I
don't know if that has more to do with characters, writing and
execution, or a shift in viewer tastes preferring legally
unattached love.
</P>
<P>
   But some of ``Mad's'' best scenes were those when Jamie had had
enough, when Paul was pushing her buttons and she'd storm around
the apartment growling or dash out of the place altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Jill wouldn't dream of doing that.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Mad'' had to evolve to that point. The series started out
as yet another talky urban sitcom about young, bagel-eating yuppies
populating the streets of Manhattan. Its search for laughs in the
little things of life made it seem too ``Seinfeld'' for its own
good.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the exploration of the offbeat details gradually revealed a
relationship that was intensely intimate and candid and
realistically fragile.
</P>
<P>
   The cliff-hanging story arc during the 1996-97 season framed
this truth especially well. When Jamie kissed a co-worker, Paul
went into an emotional tailspin. Although it seemed almost silly to
think that the two would actually break up (and become, what, ``No
Longer Mad About You?''), the writing showing a relationship at a
crossroads was effective. That it was Jamie, not Paul, who strayed,
was also an attempt to roam the seldom-used road.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the nasty things critics have said about the series
since the baby arrived, the best episode of the entire run was the
one-shot, real-time episode when the couple stood outside their
door listening to daughter Mabel cry herself to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides of the independent-baby debate were well-represented
and executed with great care and sensitivity. Their decision to let
her cry _ and Jamie's last words of ``We broke her heart'' _ still
rings with me.
</P>
<P>
   Neither series could promote feminism without making fun of it,
which I think is a direct result of men dominating writing staffs.
But both series advocated equality for women while showing how
difficult equal partnerships can be.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the abilities of Hunt and Richardson often came
in, as their roles carried the burden of delivering value-laden
messages.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite ``Home'' exchanges begins with Tim saying to
Jill, ``Why do you bug me during football games? Did I bother you
during childbirth?'' and Jill responding, ``No, but you bothered me
during conception.''
</P>
<P>
   That verbal jousting is played back during the season finale. In
fact, flashbacks are a part of both season-enders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad About You,'' which aired Monday night, was the most
ambitious, and most successful. Janeane Garofalo plays a grown-up
Mabel talking about her parents, and the results are surprising and
touching.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Home,'' airing Tuesday, Al is getting married while
Jill and Tim contemplate a move to Indiana to follow Jill's career.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. Even with Thomas a no-show, it manages to go out
the same way it came in: safe, reassuring, comfortable.

SHOW REVEALS LIMITLESS POSSIBILITIES OF SOMETIMES DISDAINED ART
FORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Sculpture, critic Charles Baudelaire said in
the mid-1800s, is something you trip over when stepping back to
look at a painting.
</P>
<P>
   Baudelaire considered sculpture boring and the work of
uncivilized people. Having little use for it, he likely would shun
_ assuming he were alive, that is _ a new Fort Worth exhibition
called ``House of Sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   Opened Sunday at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, ``House of
Sculpture'' features about 30 works by about 30 artists _ and nary
a painting. The earliest work on view is the Modern's classic
Joseph Cornell box, ``Untitled (Medici Boy)'' of 1953. A couple of
the most recent are 1998-99 works by Rachel Whiteread, one of the
YBAs (Young British Artists) who have taken the world by storm, and
Joseph Havel, a Houston artist known for his poetic castings of
such improbable items as shirt collars and (in this show)
bedsheets.
</P>
<P>
   This is a nervy show for the Modern to present. Baudelaire
wasn't (and isn't) the only member of the art elite to disdain
sculpture. Snobbery isn't the only reason sculpture shows are
scarcer than hen's teeth, though.
</P>
<P>
   Sculpture is difficult to display to advantage. Insensitively
installed, sculpture tends to look and feel as if it's in the way _
like something you'd, well, bump into. Too, the cost of shipping
sculpture is enough to discourage many a museum.
</P>
<P>
   So why _ apart from the fact that it surely can afford to pay
for shipping _ is our Modern Art Museum presenting this show?
(Which, by the way, is exclusive to Fort Worth.)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Auping, the Modern's chief curator, has a ready answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sculpture of the last 30 years is literally all over the
place,'' Auping says. ``You could argue that the most radical
developments in the art of the past 25 years have been in
sculpture. Since the end of World War II, sculpture has been
remarkably aggressive in staking out new territories, in adapting
new and changing ``Zeitgeists.''''
</P>
<P>
   That's another way of saying that many of the most significant
artists of the past several decades have been involved with
sculpture. Artists like Cornell, Dan Flavin, Eva Hesse, Robert
Irwin, Donald Judd, Bruce Nauman, Claes Oldenburg, Richard Serra
and David Smith _ all of whom are represented in this exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   With pop art and minimalism in the '60s, sculpture stepped down
from its pedestal: Andy Warhol made what might be called a
sculpture _ it occupied space, after all _ that was a simulation of
a Brillo box. Californian John McCracken made tall, narrow,
immaculately finished slabs that stood on the floor and leaned
against the wall. And they hardly were alone.
</P>
<P>
   Then came artists like Hesse, Nauman and Lynda Benglis. They
made objects that dangled from the wall, that drooped or appeared
to be oozing, or that lay abjectly on the floor. From there,
Nauman, Irwin and others explored the sculptural possibilities of
light and sound as defining or occupying space.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with such endless possibilities, Auping says he took
a relatively conservative tack in choosing this show. Initially, at
least, he looked at sculpture in terms of something that stands in
space, and he seemingly stretched out from there. What he ended up
with is an installation that encompasses many of the above
sculptural possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   To make a bit more sense of it all, Auping has grouped some
works according to when they were made, as well as according to
themes like figuration and minimalism.
</P>
<P>
   Installing it, he effectively assumed the role of some of the
sculptures, standing where they would stand, considering their
relationships with other nearby works or pieces within range of
vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with sculpture forces you to think differently,''
Auping says. ``Installing paintings is about continually looking.
Establishing transitions with sculpture involves different
instincts. It's more about walking and standing. You almost have to
pretend to be the sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting exhibition flows gently, rather than making
grandiose statements. It lets people figure out quite a bit on
their own. And that's really the best way of getting to know art.

TWO LESSONS IN SAVING FOR RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I would like to retire in 28 years at age 60 with
inflation-adjusted income that matches our current level of
$85,000. Maybe I'm an optimist, but I believe Social Security will
exist for us. Currently we have $25,000 in a 401(k) plan, to which
we contribute 3 percent of our income, and there is an employer
match of 25 percent of the first 6 percent. This is invested 10
percent each in Fidelity Overseas and Fidelity Worldwide, 20
percent each in Fidelity Magellan and Blue Chip Growth, and 40
percent in Fidelity Contrafund. Our general savings, to be used for
nonessential living expenses, possible college expenses beyond a
program we have established for our two children, or retirement,
amount to $10,000 in three mutual funds. We add to these accounts
irregularly, depending on how fruitful the year was. Will we
achieve our goals with this investment plan?
</P>
<P>
   M.B., Londonderry, N.H. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Alas, my friend, you're not even likely to come close.
</P>
<P>
   The big stickler is that phrase you used: inflation adjusted. If
we presume inflation averages 3.5 percent during the next 28 years,
you will need $222,714 to buy what $85,000 buys today.
</P>
<P>
   If you keep up with your current savings plan and you achieve 10
percent average annual growth, you'll have a little in excess of
$800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you get raises during all those years and continue
your contributions as a percentage of salary, the accumulation will
be greater, but probably nowhere near enough to meet your target.
</P>
<P>
   I would begin by correcting the most obvious mistake, which is
your failure to take fullest advantage of your employer's matching
program.
</P>
<P>
   If you went up to 6 percent contributions to the 401(k), the
match would double, to a level of $1,500 a year. This would also
bump your expected accumulation in the 401(k) to a little in excess
of $1.4 million _ still not enough to take you to your goals, but a
whole lot better.
</P>
<P>
   There's no problem with your selection of investments, but if
you indeed want to have a comfortable retirement, you're going to
have to take the whole business of saving more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   So what would it take to support your plan for retirement? You
might come fairly close if you moved your 401(k) savings level to
10 percent of your salary, and kept it at that level every time you
got a raise.
</P>
<P>
   Ten percent contributions, plus the maximum employer match,
would take you to a figure just shy of $2 million, again assuming
10 percent investment returns. And as your salary and contributions
increased, so would employer matches, taking the pool even higher.
</P>
<P>
   And a more disciplined approach to your other savings program
would also help, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are 30 and 34 years old, respectively, and
have worked to save fairly aggressively. We are now trying to
determine if what we have saved is in the right vehicles and
determine if we're on the right course to finance a comfortable
retirement (very far off), a new home, and a vacation home purchase
within three years. We make about $200,000 annually and have
accumulated $137,000 in retirement savings. We have no credit card
or auto loan debt, and owe $195,000 on our home, which is appraised
at $249,000. We are both donating the maximum allowed by our 401(k)
plans. We also have $20,500 invested in a mutual fund and four
common stock accounts with dividend reinvestment programs, and we
add $900 a month to these five accounts. Finally, we have $146,300
in other savings, of which $33,000 is in a money market fund and
the rest in mutual fund and common stock accounts. Do you have any
suggestions on how we're investing?
</P>
<P>
   B.M., Acton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You are certainly on the right path for a very comfortable
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   You don't mention how much you contribute to your 401(k)
accounts, but if each of you is contributing 10 percent of your
salaries, or a total of $1,666 a month, your accumulation would be
in excess of $5.8 million in 30 years, presuming 10 percent average
annual portfolio growth.
</P>
<P>
   Your portfolio is nicely diversified, and although you don't
give details of how your husband's 401(k) is invested, if he is
following your lead his will also be well diversified.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing I worry about is how you're going to finance the
purchases of a new primary residence and a vacation home within the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   You will probably need more cash than that $33,000 in the money
market fund, so you might either consider selling some of the stock
positions _ after examining the tax consequences of the potential
sales, of course _ or diverting some of that $900 in monthly
savings that's going into nonretirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Three years is a short savings time frame, and putting
short-term money in stocks is pretty dangerous. I suggest you tally
up the amount of cash you will need for these purchases, and set up
the nonretirement savings accounts so that you will have it on hand
in liquid accounts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you diverted the $900 monthly savings to your
money market fund, that $33,000 would amount to a little more than
$73,000 over the next 36 months, here presuming 5 percent average
annual returns from the money fund.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal Reserve, is
sometimes credited with the power of an invincible Jedi knight who
can protect the economy from all evil forces: inflation, deflation,
recession or global financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this week, Greenspan's chosen weapon looked like a battered
tennis racket, not a mighty lightsabre.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the first signs that inflationary pressures could be on
the rise, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at 4.75 percent,
and chose merely to hint that it might tighten policy in future.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds prudent but is actually risky: if the beast of
inflation escapes, the increase in interest rates needed to
recapture it will then have to be bigger. And by holding rates
steady, the Fed continues to fuel a share-price bubble that if
(when?) it bursts will damage the whole economy.
</P>
<P>
   America's economic performance has been undeniably impressive
under Greenspan's care. The economy is enjoying its longest-ever
peacetime expansion and its lowest unemployment rate for almost 30
years; and, until now, inflation has remained remarkably subdued.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the jump in America's headline inflation
rate to 2.3 percent in April was a blip, caused by special factors.
After all, the rate of growth of wages has been declining.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it is argued, the Fed was wise to hold its fire. But
there were other reasons why the central bank should have been more
on its guard than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of growth of real domestic demand _ 7 percent at an
annual rate in the first quarter _ was much too fast for comfort.
And the labor market seems dangerously tight. If unemployment
continues to fall, wages will certainly accelerate. The only
question is when.
</P>
<P>
   Despite talk of a ``new paradigm,'' a large part of the fall in
American inflation over the past two years has itself been caused
by one-off factors, notably lower oil and commodity prices, and a
strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to deny that America has seen real economic
improvements. New technology and increased competition seem to have
boosted productivity growth, though this might not last.
</P>
<P>
   But the worry is that these gains have combined with a lax
monetary policy to encourage speculative excesses. Several signs of
frothiness have emerged. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (600-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The level of share prices is hard to justify even on the most
optimistic assumptions about future profits. Despite the first
signs that inflationary pressures could be on the rise, the Fed
left interest rates unchanged at 4.75 percent, and chose merely to
hint that it might tighten policy in future.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds prudent but is actually risky: if the beast boom is
starting to spill over into other assets, such as prime city
property and fine art; there has been a surge in borrowing by firms
and households; and the current-account deficit has risen to record
levels.
</P>
<P>
   These look like the classic symptoms of an overheating economy.
Some economists argue that, because of uncertainties about whether
and how the relationship between growth and inflation has changed,
and because forecasters have consistently overestimated inflation
in recent years, the Fed is still right to play safe until more
data confirm that inflation is reviving.
</P>
<P>
   An unnecessary interest-rate rise, it is said, risks cutting the
expansion short too soon. But is this really the ``safe'' option?
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, remember, cut interest rates three times last autumn,

<P>
   To argue that it is safer for the Fed to wait until it sees
inflation actually rising before it acts is like saying that there

<P>
   It takes at least a year for interest-rate changes to have their

the safe policy would surely have been to nudge rates up by a
quarter-point.
</P>
<P>

abolished the business cycle and so ensured ever-rising share
prices may well have given investors, firms and consumers a
deceptive feeling of security, which has encouraged them to take on
excessively risky positions.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the hype surrounding Japan's economic strength in the
1980s eventually spun out of control, so America's genuine recent
economic gains have been overhyped.

<P>
   Had the Fed acted earlier to let some air out of Wall Street's
bubble, America's economy might not now be looking so dangerously
unbalanced.
</P>
<P>
   The central bankers should not bear all _ or even most _ of the
blame, for it is devilishly difficult to tell the difference
between a market that is rationally exuberant and one that is
affected by a speculative bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates are a blunt weapon to wield in such
circumstances; it is impossible to predict how far share prices
could fall once they turn, or how severe the economic consequences
might be.
</P>
<P>
   These are understandable concerns. They are not, however, a
reason for Greenspan to go soft on the real menace: inflation. It
is past time for him to demonstrate that the force is still with
him. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal Reserve, is
sometimes credited with the power of an invincible Jedi knight who
can protect the economy from all evil forces: inflation, deflation,
recession or global financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this week, Greenspan's chosen weapon looked like a battered
tennis racket, not a mighty lightsabre.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the first signs that inflationary pressures could be on
the rise, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at 4.75 percent,
and chose merely to hint that it might tighten policy in future.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds prudent but is actually risky: if the beast of
inflation escapes, the increase in interest rates needed to
recapture it will then have to be bigger. And by holding rates
steady, the Fed continues to fuel a share-price bubble that if
(when?) it bursts will damage the whole economy.
</P>
<P>
   America's economic performance has been undeniably impressive
under Greenspan's care. The economy is enjoying its longest-ever
peacetime expansion and its lowest unemployment rate for almost 30
years; and, until now, inflation has remained remarkably subdued.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the jump in America's headline inflation
rate to 2.3 percent in April was a blip, caused by special factors.
After all, the rate of growth of wages has been declining.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it is argued, the Fed was wise to hold its fire. But
there were other reasons why the central bank should have been more
on its guard than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of growth of real domestic demand _ 7 percent at an
annual rate in the first quarter _ was much too fast for comfort.
And the labor market seems dangerously tight. If unemployment
continues to fall, wages will certainly accelerate. The only
question is when.
</P>
<P>
   Despite talk of a ``new paradigm,'' a large part of the fall in
American inflation over the past two years has itself been caused
by one-off factors, notably lower oil and commodity prices, and a
strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to deny that America has seen real economic
improvements. New technology and increased competition seem to have
boosted productivity growth, though this might not last.
</P>
<P>
   But the worry is that these gains have combined with a lax
monetary policy to encourage speculative excesses. Several signs of
frothiness have emerged. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (600-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The level of share prices is hard to justify even on the most
optimistic assumptions about future profits. Despite the first
signs that inflationary pressures could be on the rise, the Fed
left interest rates unchanged at 4.75 percent, and chose merely to
hint that it might tighten policy in future.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds prudent but is actually risky: if the beast boom is
starting to spill over into other assets, such as prime city
property and fine art; there has been a surge in borrowing by firms
and households; and the current-account deficit has risen to record
levels.
</P>
<P>
   These look like the classic symptoms of an overheating economy.
Some economists argue that, because of uncertainties about whether
and how the relationship between growth and inflation has changed,
and because forecasters have consistently overestimated inflation
in recent years, the Fed is still right to play safe until more
data confirm that inflation is reviving.
</P>
<P>
   An unnecessary interest-rate rise, it is said, risks cutting the
expansion short too soon. But is this really the ``safe'' option?
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, remember, cut interest rates three times last autumn,
by a total of three-quarters of a percentage point, in response to
fears about a credit crunch in the wake of Russia's default.
</P>
<P>
   Since then fears of a crunch have faded, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average has gained 40 percent, and the American economy
has proved to be growing even more briskly than had been predicted.
</P>
<P>

forecast for growth in 1999 to 3.6 percent, up from less than 2

<P>
   Praise be, Israel has a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, an unexpectedly high proportion of Israelis showed
that they wanted to see the back of Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu, who,
although skilled on television _ he conceded the election, and
resigned as the Likud's leader, with commendable grace _ was a
disastrous man to have in charge of a country.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the Labor Party's leader, and now Israel's too, has
a head start simply by not being Bibi.
</P>
<P>
   The election results leave him with problems in building a
strong coalition. But if he is to bring Israel the peace he has
promised, he must move swiftly on the Arab front.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he will have to bargain hard and thoughtfully for the
best deal he can get that is compatible with an enduring peace.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no advantage for Israel in going slowly: every day
of unnecessary delay builds up resentment at the painful
compromises that are integral to such an agreement. Above all, any
delay gives opportunities for the anti-peace lobby, Israeli and
Palestinian, to organize disruptive dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has already promised to bring Israel's soldiers home from
Lebanon in a year's time. Since this can be done safely only in the
context of a peace deal with the Syrians, who pull the strings that
control Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas, talks with Syria need to be
restarted quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Their success will partly depend on the hidden agenda of Syria's
foxy president, Hafez Assad. But, given a degree of goodwill, a
land-for-peace deal, with security provisions, should be within
reasonably easy grasp: the Israelis cannot expect to continue their
occupation of Syria's Golan Heights, but nor can the Syrians expect
to regain unconditional control.
</P>
<P>
   Peace with the Palestinians is a far more complicated,
multifaceted and passionate affair. The general outlines of a
permanent Israeli-Palestinian settlement have already been worked
out, providing the basis for negotiation on the crucially important
detail.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, there is no reason why it should take more than a
year _ maybe much less _ to punch these fuzzy half-agreements into
a firm shape that a majority of Israelis would accept in exchange
for peace with their neighbors, and that a majority of West Bankers
and Gazans would accept in exchange for a viable state. But, once
again, this is dependent on a solid foundation of goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's shortcut to goodwill is, quite simply, to note what the
previous government did and do the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has already said that he will redirect money away from
settlement expansion to various good causes: he could underline his
commitment by suspending activity on that most controversial of all
Jewish settlements, Har Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he has to pick up the pieces of the Wye agreement
that Netanyahu left broken and scattered: Israel is committed to
withdrawing from another chunk of the West Bank, releasing
political prisoners and creating a passage between the West Bank
and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   These are promises to be swiftly fulfilled before moving on to
the next stage.
</P>
<P>
   A harder task faces the Palestinians, now that the Israelis have
chosen a leader not opposed to the Oslo peace process. For the past
three years, they have been the ``virtuous'' ones, required to do
little more than swallow their grievances as the world growled at
an Israel defaulting on its signed undertakings.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Palestinian frustration has been fermenting, and
the methods used by Yasser Arafat and his men to quell dissent have
been crude, and sometimes cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however welcome the change, Yasser Arafat's job can only
become harder. For, whatever settlement he is able to wrestle out
of Israel, most Palestinians outside the West Bank and Gaza, and
many inside, will be opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing should temper the world's relief at Barak's election.
But complacency would be folly: the closer Israel and the
Palestinians get to a permanent peace, the more dissenter s, on
both sides, will be determined to capsize it. &QL;

<P>
   NATO is not losing the war for Kosovo, but it is not winning it
quickly enough either.
</P>
<P>
   Its bombing has inflicted terrible damage on Serb military
targets, but not yet enough, it seems, to force Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic to yield.
</P>
<P>
   Its record has been exemplary compared with almost any previous
air campaign, yet the toll of mistakes and casualties _ some of
them civilians caught accidentally in the bombing, others
deliberately herded into harm's way by the Serbs _ is bound to
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as NATO goes after every bridge, ammunition depot and
tank hideout that Milosevic might need to continue his ethnic
cleansing in Kosovo, Serb forces there continue to do horrific
things to those ethnic Albanians still inside the province and
beyond western reach.
</P>
<P>
   To oblige the Serbs to halt the violence, and to get the
refugees back home, NATO needs either a workable peace agreement
soon _ diplomatic efforts are once again under way _ or the resolve
to enforce a settlement using troops of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two requirements are closely linked. If the allies
had looked readier for a ground war earlier this year to back up
their threatened air strikes, Milosevic might have been slower to
pick a fight and keener to talk peace.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments had their reasons for caution. Building a
consensus among 19 nations even for an air war seemed hard enough
at the time, so any commitment to start a ground invasion to
liberate Kosovo would have been politically much more divisive.
</P>
<P>
   This is God's own partisan country, not the tank-friendly desert
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Western public opinion, it was believed, had no stomach for the
sorts of casualties that a ground war would have entailed. But
public opinion in the West has proved stouter in support of the air
campaign than the politicians had expected. In most countries _
including the United States, Britain and France _ it remains firm.
</P>
<P>
   It is popular pressure, too, that has pushed governments to take
in more refugees, though temporary homes still need to be found for
many more. And it is revulsion at the refugees' reports of mass
murder and rape, and the wholesale clearing and burning of
villages, that has forged the cohesion in NATO to continue the air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the allies cannot afford to dawdle. For a start, unless
Milosevic is made to back down pretty soon, there will be no chance
of getting most of the refugees back to their homes _ those that
are still standing _ before winter sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Equally serious, the allies' cohesion, firm as it has been so
far, may not remain so. Milosevic has been careful to let the
world's television cameras film only the limited damage from NATO's
bombs and missiles, not the scorched earth and mass graves in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion in the West, especially in the wobblier countries
such as Italy and Germany, gets queasier at every incident
involving unintended civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Any small fissures in NATO's otherwise solid front encourage
Milosevic to sit tight, rather than sue for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The allies need to do two things. The first is to step up the
air war. Although wave after wave of aircraft has been thrown into
the fray, all along NATO has been fighting the war with one wing
clipped. Only now is it preparing to launch air-defense-stretching
bombing raids from around the compass.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks ago America sent (an unmilitarily modest) two dozen of its
supposedly fearsome Apache anti-tank helicopters to take the fight
closer to those doing the Kosovo cleansing, but they have yet to
see action.
</P>
<P>
   NATO needs lots more of them _ and the permission to use them _
if it is to knock the fight out of the Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Second, NATO governments need to start a build-up of combat
troops in the region.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's spokesmen claim it is winning the air war, cutting Serb
supply lines and separating Milosevic's forces in Kosovo so that
they can no longer offer coordinated resistance.
</P>
<P>
   If this is indeed so, then NATO's commanders need to be ready to
take advantage of their success and, with or without a peace
agreement already in their pocket, be able to start clearing
territory to escort the refugees safely home.
</P>
<P>
   And if it is not so, and Milosevic has plenty of fight in him
yet, then NATO will need more military options anyway to pile on
the pressure. In either case, there could well be western
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   This week Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, said it would
be ``unthinkable'' for German troops to take part in a ground war
in Kosovo. Yet how much more unthinkable that NATO's desire for a
risk-free war should allow Milosevic to win this one. &QL;

<P>
   People in the rich world are eating better, smoking less,
exercising more and receiving better medical care than they did 30
or 40 years ago. But are all these healthy activities not just
boring but positively unhealthy?
</P>
<P>
   So it would seem: more and more people are also living on
welfare benefits intended for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers in some countries are so dire that it is a wonder
they can hobble along at all. In the Netherlands, for instance, 13
percent of the working-age population claims to be disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, almost half the people of working age who claim a
welfare benefit are receiving money for being disabled or sick; one
man in four aged between 60 and 65 is claiming incapacity benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In Norway, more than 57 percent of people aged between 55 and 64
are registered as disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Can the figures be reconciled? Or is disability simply the rich
world's biggest welfare scam?
</P>
<P>
   Incontrovertibly, the health of the old has been improving.
Being old has never been much fun.
</P>
<P>
   The joke used to be that, if you woke up in the morning and
nothing ached, you were probably dead. But life expectancy for
people aged 65 has continued to rise, and so have the number of
years that older folk can expect to live for without suffering
severe or even moderate disability.
</P>
<P>
   Most people can expect a couple of unpleasant years of
incapacity at the end of their lives, but that period now typically
arrives when they reach their mid-to-late 70s or even their 80s,
rather than their 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, American research suggests that the decline in
disability among older people has accelerated: it was faster in the
first half of the 1990s than in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   So why the near-universal rise in the number of people of
working age who claim to be disabled? The truth is that most
claimants are merely suffering the pains of being past the prime of
life and unwanted by employers.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of rich countries have long used disability benefits as a
way to shovel out of sight the most intractable group of the
unemployed: people _ mainly men _ in their 50s and early 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some governments have encouraged older workers to claim
to be disabled by obliging doctors to consider the state of the job
market when deciding whether a patient should be registered as
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, Italy and Finland all make access to disability
benefits easier when unemployment is high.
</P>
<P>
   Using disability benefits to ``solve'' labor market problems is
unwise and unkind. It inflates the cost of supporting older
unemployed people, and deflects governments from searching for
better solutions for their plight.
</P>
<P>
   But tightening the rules is politically fraught, as Britain's
prime minister, Tony Blair, has found: he has faced a furious
parliamentary revolt over a plan to make disability benefits harder
to claim.
</P>
<P>
   Even when governments try to tighten the rules, people may find
ingenious ways around them, if the incentive is great enough.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, a rise in the number of supposedly disabled
claimants seems to have coincided with tighter policing of access
to unemployment benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, arguably the world leader in phoney
disability, a tougher government line on physical disability has
encouraged more folk to claim mental disability.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that somebody does not suffer from disabling stress is
even harder than proving that their backache is too bad for them to
work.
</P>
<P>
   One option is to tighten the rules on what counts as disability,
and to administer them vigorously. Another is to change the balance
of incentives.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries, benefits reward those who retire early,
especially if their incomes are already low. It would be better to
ensure that those who continue to work in late middle age also
continue to clock up extra pension entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   A third possibility is to alter expectations. Of course, some
disabled folk cannot work and will never work. But, for many, a job
would bring self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   If governments assumed that even the disabled should sometimes
work for their welfare, the truly disabled might be the most
grateful of all. &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico this week launched a new game. It is one
the whole family, indeed the whole country, will enjoy, and may
even take a small part in. All the main players must follow the
rules; or if they do not, they must at least pretend to do so
convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   And the lucky winner will end up as president of Mexico _ maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The game is the presidential nomination of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
   For six of the PRI's seven decades in power that has been a
rather strange contest, since it has always involved only one
player _ the incumbent president _ and only one rule: the president
would choose the candidate, who would then duly succeed, either
because the people voted for him, or because the electoral
commission (which is to say the government) said they had.
</P>
<P>
   Now the electoral commission is independent, and the PRI can no
longer take victory for granted.
</P>
<P>
   In an election in 1997, it lost its majority in Congress for the
first time. Even so, the PRI may still win next year's presidential
race, but to do so it must avoid splits.
</P>
<P>
   Recent state elections have highlighted that risk. Where the
party has held primaries, and done so cleanly, it has gone on to
win the state governorship.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, it has sometimes had problems: on three occasions,
state elections have been won for the opposition by PRI renegades
denied their party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiences seem to have persuaded President Ernesto
Zedillo and the PRI's bigwigs of the need for radical change in the
presidential-nomination game.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo hinted at this last year, famously promising to end the
traditional selection method known as the dedazo, or
finger-pointing, by saying ``I will cut off my finger.''
</P>
<P>
   But when in March he suggested a primary-election system similar
to that in the United States, with votes staggered over several
months, skeptics reckoned that would let him secure a commanding
lead for his favored candidate by choosing which states would hold
early ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``One must not forget that hands have ten fingers,'' said Jesus
Silva-Herzog, himself passed over for the presidency in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The rules announced on May 17 amputate several more fingers, as
Silva-Herzog conceded. The whole country will vote in a single
primary on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being restricted to party activists and sympathizers
_ dubious, since the PRI does not even have a complete list of
members _ the ballot will be open to all registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates must win as many as possible of 300 electoral
districts of roughly equal size, forcing them to spread their
efforts evenly around the country.
</P>
<P>
   There will be limits on campaign spending and on television and
radio time. Those hopefuls who are already littering the airwaves
must now desist until Aug. 1, when the 14-week campaign begins.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, few people doubt that Zedillo favors one man in
particular: Francisco Labastida, his 56-year-old interior minister,
who this week resigned his job and announced his candidacy. Like
the president, he is from the PRI's reformist, free-market wing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, suggests Joy Langston, a political scientist at CIDE,
a Mexico City graduate school, as a protege of the president,
Labastida might be more likely to protect Zedillo from the
opprobrium that some recent Mexican presidents have faced after
their terms ended.
</P>
<P>
   But Labastida trails in most opinion polls, and faces a powerful
challenge from traditionalists, such as Roberto Madrazo, the
governor of Tabasco state, who has led two recent polls, and Manuel
Bartlett, until recently the governor of Puebla. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 600. OPTIONAL MATERIAL CONTINUES) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   How can Zedillo help his man? The rules are not perfect. The
primary will be supervised not by an independent body, but by a PRI
committee under Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, a former interior
minister and wily master of the old game.
</P>
<P>
   The spending limits, and how they will be enforced, are still
matters to be decided; at any rate, their details remain
unannounced.
</P>
<P>
   And for all of Mexico's undeniable moves towards full democracy,
claims of overspending, ballot-rigging and vote-buying still dog
almost every local election. Even the left-wing Party of the
Democratic Revolution, which makes most such claims, was last month
riven by charges of foul play in its internal leadership contest.
</P>
<P>
   But the PRI knows its election must be seen to be free of all
visible manipulation. Even so, Zedillo is not quite fingerless.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's long tradition of one-party rule has endowed the
central government with myriad ways of getting local politicians
and trade unions to mobilize their supporters. And Zedillo himself
has been working behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   He invited both Bartlett and Madrazo for coffee last week.
Earlier this month Miguel Aleman, governor of the state of
Veracruz, popped over for breakfast and stayed four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman drew support from all wings of the party. And on May 19,
he announced that he would not be running (as did Esteban
Moctezuma, like Labastida a modernizer).
</P>
<P>
   What was agreed over breakfast is unclear. But one of Aleman's
advisers believes that he will use his influence both in public
(his father and namesake was a still-remembered president) and in
private (he is a hugely rich and well-connected businessman as well
as governor) in favor of Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   That would strengthen Zedillo's favorite enormously. And all
within the rules of the game. After all, they say nothing about
using your fingers at breakfast. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the more odious things about modern presidential politics
is the attempt to create ``character'' by injecting what
screenwriters like to call ``backstory.''
</P>
<P>
   Already the Republican Party is rewriting the life of George W.
Bush into the Texan equivalent of ``Henry V,'' a responsible young
king emerging from a misspent youth.
</P>
<P>
   Now Al Gore, apparently panicking that his spinners have not
woven enough tales of their own, has recreated himself as the
father of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   No such antics for the man probably lying in third place, Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   After several days trailing after him in New Hampshire, a
frustrated group of reporters, desperate for even the smallest
personal detail, asked the former senator to name his favorite
book. ``I'd rather not go down that road,'' came the slightly
mumbled reply.
</P>
<P>
   This is odd because, with the possible exception of John McCain,
a Republican senator who was once a prisoner of war in Vietnam,
Bradley has more backstory than anybody else in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Born in a small Missouri town, the son of a banker, the lanky
young man with huge hands first achieved fame by leading the
American basketball team to victory over the Russians at the 1964
Olympics. Then he became a New York Knick.
</P>
<P>
   A Rhodes scholar and a Princeton graduate, he wrote an
intelligent book about being on the road with the Knicks and then,
as if to prove his seriousness, married a professor of comparative
literature (something it is hard to imagine Dennis Rodman doing).
</P>
<P>
   Turning to politics, he represented New Jersey in the Senate for
18 years, fending off several pleas to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he resigned his seat, declaring politics to be
``broken,'' took up some teaching posts, earned several million
dollars from consulting and wrote more worthy books. Now he has
reappeared from this period of reflection, saying he is ready for
the main job.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of hinterland that Bush or Gore would love. Yet
Bradley refuses to discuss his private life.
</P>
<P>
   He occasionally mentions long-dead relations, such as a racist
aunt, and he often starts with a lame joke about basketball. But he
is reluctant to do ``hoops'' for the cameras, and his living family
is kept resolutely off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this some act. His decades as a star seem to have left
him with a gentlemanly reserve that in other countries might be
described as aristocratic.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of people in New Jersey who have known him
for a long time, trust him, but still do not understand him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what sort of friends one might meet chez Bradley, one
close adviser immediately answers that he has never been to the
house _ ``except of course on business.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is equally unrevealing about his ideas. In terms of
voting records, there is not much to choose between him and Gore.
But, while the vice-president seems to have positions aplenty,
Bradley insists that he is still in the listening stage of his
campaign; the policies will come later.
</P>
<P>
   The media too are having to wait. The talk shows have been
turned down so often that they have given up calling.
</P>
<P>
   As for segments on the nightly news, he may not be a worse
public speaker than Gore, but his speeches remain idiosyncratically
empty of soundbites. One shudders to think what his television
commercials will be like.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley's own form of anti-politics seems to be doing pretty
well. Some polls show him catching up with Gore. The Republicans
have started running background checks on him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite limiting himself to individual contributions of no more
than $1,000, he is on course to raise around $20 million _ enough
to give Gore a fight. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this prominence owes quite a lot to luck: if any
other Democrat had chosen to challenge Gore, Bradley would not be
the sole repository of anti-Gore feeling. Purely by turning up, he
has put himself in the semifinals of the competition to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in New Hampshire at least, the evidence is slightly more
than just good fortune: in nursing homes, companies and schools,
Bradley seems to be clicking with his listeners, an alarming number
of whom, from Gore's point of view, have already met the
vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   One common theory has it that even if Bradley does well in
small, rich, well-educated New Hampshire, he will follow the path
of other ideas-politicians, such as Gary Hart and Paul Tsongas, and
be crucified once the race becomes more televisual.
</P>
<P>
   That may be likely, but it is not inevitable. Hart and Tsongas
were both knocked out of their primaries by Democrats with more of
a common touch than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And this time New York and California, two huge states where
Bradley seems to be doing well, hold their primaries much earlier
than in previous years. Momentum could count for a lot. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But only if Bradley says a little bit more about where he
stands. There is a limit to how many times you can host debates
about Social Security or education without saying what you will do
about them; you also need some ideas of your own.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his pet issues may come in handy. Campaign-finance reform
is a sly way of embarrassing Gore. The quest for racial
understanding, a perennial Bradley theme, looks more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In his favor, he has in his pocket a check for $1,000 from
Michael Jordan and a long record of standing up for blacks (a
constituency Clinton is supposed to deliver to Gore).
</P>
<P>
   Yet his focus often seems two-tone rather than multicolored.
During a keynote speech on race at Phillips Exeter Academy, one
young Asian listener went to sleep ``because he wasn't saying
anything about me.'' She still went to get his autograph at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   In states like California, non-black minorities may be less
forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   However, the real thing that Bradley will eventually have to
reveal is himself. That does not mean discussing on ``Oprah''
whether he wears boxers or briefs: after Bill Clinton, many
Americans will yearn for a president with some degree of reserve.
But it does mean saying, at least, what books you read.
</P>
<P>
   For all his decency and intelligence, there is a lurking
suspicion that Bradley is a bit of an odd fish. Some doubts seem
trivial. Why, for instance, did he seem to lose all interest in
basketball once he stopped playing? Others are immense.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he still has not fully explained why exactly he
is running for president. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the more odious things about modern presidential politics
is the attempt to create ``character'' by injecting what
screenwriters like to call ``backstory.''
</P>
<P>
   Already the Republican Party is rewriting the life of George W.
Bush into the Texan equivalent of ``Henry V,'' a responsible young
king emerging from a misspent youth.
</P>
<P>
   Now Al Gore, apparently panicking that his spinners have not
woven enough tales of their own, has recreated himself as the
father of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   No such antics for the man probably lying in third place, Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   After several days trailing after him in New Hampshire, a
frustrated group of reporters, desperate for even the smallest
personal detail, asked the former senator to name his favorite
book. ``I'd rather not go down that road,'' came the slightly
mumbled reply.
</P>
<P>
   This is odd because, with the possible exception of John McCain,
a Republican senator who was once a prisoner of war in Vietnam,
Bradley has more backstory than anybody else in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Born in a small Missouri town, the son of a banker, the lanky
young man with huge hands first achieved fame by leading the
American basketball team to victory over the Russians at the 1964
Olympics. Then he became a New York Knick.
</P>
<P>
   A Rhodes scholar and a Princeton graduate, he wrote an
intelligent book about being on the road with the Knicks and then,
as if to prove his seriousness, married a professor of comparative
literature (something it is hard to imagine Dennis Rodman doing).
</P>
<P>
   Turning to politics, he represented New Jersey in the Senate for
18 years, fending off several pleas to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he resigned his seat, declaring politics to be
``broken,'' took up some teaching posts, earned several million
dollars from consulting and wrote more worthy books. Now he has
reappeared from this period of reflection, saying he is ready for
the main job.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of hinterland that Bush or Gore would love. Yet
Bradley refuses to discuss his private life.
</P>
<P>
   He occasionally mentions long-dead relations, such as a racist
aunt, and he often starts with a lame joke about basketball. But he
is reluctant to do ``hoops'' for the cameras, and his living family
is kept resolutely off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this some act. His decades as a star seem to have left
him with a gentlemanly reserve that in other countries might be
described as aristocratic.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of people in New Jersey who have known him
for a long time, trust him, but still do not understand him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what sort of friends one might meet chez Bradley, one
close adviser immediately answers that he has never been to the
house _ ``except of course on business.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is equally unrevealing about his ideas. In terms of
voting records, there is not much to choose between him and Gore.
But, while the vice-president seems to have positions aplenty,
Bradley insists that he is still in the listening stage of his
campaign; the policies will come later.
</P>
<P>
   The media too are having to wait. The talk shows have been
turned down so often that they have given up calling.
</P>
<P>
   As for segments on the nightly news, he may not be a worse
public speaker than Gore, but his speeches remain idiosyncratically
empty of soundbites. One shudders to think what his television
commercials will be like.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley's own form of anti-politics seems to be doing pretty
well. Some polls show him catching up with Gore. The Republicans
have started running background checks on him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite limiting himself to individual contributions of no more
than $1,000, he is on course to raise around $20 million _ enough
to give Gore a fight. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this prominence owes quite a lot to luck: if any
other Democrat had chosen to challenge Gore, Bradley would not be
the sole repository of anti-Gore feeling. Purely by turning up, he
has put himself in the semifinals of the competition to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in New Hampshire at least, the evidence is slightly more
than just good fortune: in nursing homes, companies and schools,
Bradley seems to be clicking with his listeners, an alarming number
of whom, from Gore's point of view, have already met the
vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   One common theory has it that even if Bradley does well in
small, rich, well-educated New Hampshire, he will follow the path
of other ideas-politicians, such as Gary Hart and Paul Tsongas, and
be crucified once the race becomes more televisual.
</P>
<P>
   That may be likely, but it is not inevitable. Hart and Tsongas
were both knocked out of their primaries by Democrats with more of
a common touch than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And this time New York and California, two huge states where
Bradley seems to be doing well, hold their primaries much earlier
than in previous years. Momentum could count for a lot. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But only if Bradley says a little bit more about where he
stands. There is a limit to how many times you can host debates
about Social Security or education without saying what you will do
about them; you also need some ideas of your own.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his pet issues may come in handy. Campaign-finance reform
is a sly way of embarrassing Gore. The quest for racial
understanding, a perennial Bradley theme, looks more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In his favor, he has in his pocket a check for $1,000 from
Michael Jordan and a long record of standing up for blacks (a
constituency Clinton is supposed to deliver to Gore).
</P>
<P>
   Yet his focus often seems two-tone rather than multicolored.
During a keynote speech on race at Phillips Exeter Academy, one
young Asian listener went to sleep ``because he wasn't saying
anything about me.'' She still went to get his autograph at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   In states like California, non-black minorities may be less
forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   However, the real thing that Bradley will eventually have to
reveal is himself. That does not mean discussing on ``Oprah''
whether he wears boxers or briefs: after Bill Clinton, many
Americans will yearn for a president with some degree of reserve.
But it does mean saying, at least, what books you read.
</P>
<P>
   For all his decency and intelligence, there is a lurking
suspicion that Bradley is a bit of an odd fish. Some doubts seem
trivial. Why, for instance, did he seem to lose all interest in
basketball once he stopped playing? Others are immense.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he still has not fully explained why exactly he
is running for president. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ The day NATO started bombing Yugoslavia, Arab
newspapers, like European and American ones, carried banner
headlines about the raids.
</P>
<P>
   But on the editorial pages the view was generally very
different: whereas NATO's leaders seemed to expect praise from
Muslim Arabs for the defense of their co-religionists in Kosovo,
they earned mainly rebukes for sidestepping the United Nations and
``taking the law into their own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   One columnist in a London-based Arabic daily claimed that ``the
present offensive against Serbia shows that NATO is determined to
strip the international community of its power.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Muslims in the Middle East do, of course, sympathize with
the Kosovars. Any Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians and Sudanese who
paid attention at school remember that it was Albanian converts to
Islam _ such as Muhammad Ali, a 19th-century pasha of Egypt _ who
once ruled their countries.
</P>
<P>
   On airliners, in schools, at mosques and on the street, many
Arabs have been digging deeply into their pockets for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The bejewelled ladies of a Kuwaiti women's group sent a
planeload of aid, and the poorer citizens of Sidon, in Lebanon,
have been throwing banknotes onto sheets carried through the
streets by a local Islamic group.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Crescent, the Muslim world's equivalent of the Red
Cross, has set up refugee camps in both Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Governments, especially in the rich Gulf Arab states, are also
doing their bit on the humanitarian front. The United Arab
Emirates, famously, has set up a ``five-star camp,'' complete with
satellite telephones, security guards and its own airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has
complained that the camp is so luxurious that its occupants are
reluctant to move on to longer-term accommodation, well-wishers in
the Emirates insist that three hot meals a day and spotless loos
are the least the Kosovars deserve after their ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to what NATO is doing, most Arab governments
sing a different tune.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, countries like Libya and Iraq came out quickly
in support of Yugoslavia, no doubt seeing a prospective new member
of the rogue-states club. But among the West's allies in the region
only the Emirates has offered to send troops as peacekeepers _
though not, even then, as part of a NATO-led force.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, have mumbled platitudes
about ending aggression, but little more.
</P>
<P>
   Why the reluctance to applaud action designed to get the
Kosovars back to their homes?
</P>
<P>
   In part, after the West's pretty ineffectual bombing of Iraq, a
lot of Arabs fear that NATO will just make a mess of it: many Arab
officials agree with Saddam Hussein that the weapons the western
powers ``use to scare the world are incapable of changing things.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, they fear setting a precedent that might come back to
haunt them. Four Arab countries _ Lebanon, Libya, Sudan and Iraq _
have been the targets of American bombs, shells or missiles in the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even Israel's foreign minister, Ariel Sharon, has expressed some
misgivings, presumably hoping to be heard by the Palestinians of
the West Bank and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Middle Eastern governments simply do not want to stir
up those of their citizens who tend to get angrier about what NATO
does than about Serb atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there have been street protests against the
Serbs, notably in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, two
parts of the Middle East where people know what it is like to be
ejected from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Editorials all across the region complain that Arab governments
are standing idly by. In the popular view, the Kosovars' plight
calls for intervention by the United Nations or by Muslim
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Few Arabs trust NATO's claim to be acting out of concern for the
Kosovars. Some say that NATO is flexing its muscles merely to let
the world know who is boss.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest that it knew its bombing would speed up the
Serbs' ethnic-cleansing campaign, and so rid Europe of Muslims; and
that the attacks on Christian Serbia are just a way of softening up
Muslim opinion for the next blitz on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of the issue is not exactly calm. The one Muslim
country in the region where reactions have been relatively
enthusiastic is non-Arab Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The Turks, who conquered Kosovo in the 14th century and
abandoned the local converts to Islam when they retreated in the
19th century, feel strongly about their historical, religious and
cultural ties to the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than 3 million Turks, including many influential
politicians and businessmen, are of Albanian descent.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Turkey _ a NATO member _ itself has a less
than spotless record with minorities: its Armenians suffered hugely
during the First World War, and the Kurdish part of the country has
been having a rough time for years past.
</P>
<P>
   So most of Turkey's generals and politicians are happy to stand
by NATO, especially when Greece is being less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   The Turks have put their aircraft into the bombing campaign, and
their bases at NATO's disposal, no doubt hoping that in return
their NATO partners will now nag them a bit less about Turkey's own
current problems with its Kurds and its Islamists. &QL;

ADS SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE ABOUT BREAST CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ IN 50 years on Earth, I have seen many
advertisements that missed the mark so badly they should have been
classified as ``friendly fire.''
</P>
<P>
   A new, three-page ad for Nolvadex, the anti-cancer drug
tamoxifen, is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Printed in mainstream magazines, not medical journals, the ad is
aimed at women who are afraid of developing breast cancer _ which
is to say practically every woman alive. It features a large photo
of the back of a slim, young-looking woman in a black lacy bra and
black panties. She sits like a statue amid bed sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The ad copy headline: ``If you care about breast cancer, care
more about being a 1.7 than a 36B.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1.7 refers to the breast cancer risk assessment test.
</P>
<P>
   Score 1.7 or above and you are considered high risk by the
medical profession. Your chances of getting breast cancer are
almost double the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing your number gives you power, and knowing about
Nolvadex should give you hope,'' the ad soothes. ``Because even if
you are at high risk, Nolvadex has been proven to significantly
reduce the incidence of breast cancer in women at high risk.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll talk about that ``proof'' later. Look at the ad's overt
message.
</P>
<P>
   Black lacy underwear, bed sheets and a babe signal one thing,
right? Gotcha! Then you get hit with a truly insulting implication:
If you're not too vain or obsessed with the size of your breasts,
you'll be scared enough to check your risk for breast cancer.
(``You owe it to yourself to find out.'') If you're high-risk, be
smart and ask your doctor for Nolvadex. (``There is something you
can do.'')
</P>
<P>
   Nolvadex may indeed turn out to be the miracle prevention drug
that its manufacturer and the National Cancer Institute have touted
it to be. Since 1973, tamoxifen has been a highly effective
treatment for diagnosed breast cancers. Raking in about $500
million in annual sales, Nolvadex has made its British-Swedish drug
manufacturer AstraZeneca Plc, a major player on the global
pharmaceutical stage.
</P>
<P>
   But in April 1998, the results of a National Cancer Institute
study of 13,388 high-risk women catapulted AstraZeneca into a new
universe of potential earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was interrupted 14 months before its
scheduled completion, NCI researchers pronounced tamoxifen a breast
cancer ``preventive'' for high-risk women. Tracked for an average
of three years, 6,600 of the women took tamoxifen while 6,000 took
placebos. In the tamoxifen group, 85 developed breast cancer
compared to 154 in the placebo group.
</P>
<P>
   The actual difference is only 69 cases, but that translates into
a powerful sounding ``45 percent decrease'' for the tamoxifen
users.
</P>
<P>
   British researchers quickly blasted the National Cancer
Institute for basing its conclusions on such a brief study: 10
years is considered a better indicator for any such trial.
</P>
<P>
   Further, tamoxifen is supposed to be taken for five years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, three European studies found little difference
between tamoxifen-placebo groups.
</P>
<P>
   None of that mattered. Despite Novadex's side effects _ a 2-3
times greater risk of uterine cancer, blood clots, strokes,
cataracts and hot flashes _ women at high risk for breast cancer
inundated doctors with demands for the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Two months before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave
tamoxifen a very qualified OK as a preventive, AstraZeneca and
Europe's fifth largest drug company, Roche Holding AG, announced
they would jointly promote Nolvadex in the United States. The drug
is available in generic form elsewhere, but AstraZeneca has
exclusive manufacturing rights here until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the American Society of Clinical Oncology gave
tamoxifen another lukewarm thumbs-up as a prophylactic.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors should offer the drug to high-risk women, said the
group, but not recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the Nolvadex ad, you learn that the drug
``is not for everybody.'' Tamoxifen's side effects are listed along
with an 800 number for a free video. Nowhere do you learn some of
the most important numbers about breast cancer and high risk.
</P>
<P>
   While breast cancer strikes every age group, more than
three-fourths of the cases are diagnosed in women over age 50.
</P>
<P>
   Merely reaching your 60th birthday automatically qualifies you
as high risk.
</P>
<P>
   In the NCI study, tamoxifen prevented 20 breast cancers in every
1,000 women over 50 who still had a uterus. It also caused
life-threatening side effects in 22 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The size and mainstream placement of the Nolvadex ads aggravates
a growing American phobia: Being a woman means you'll probably get
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the average U.S. woman stands a 12 percent chance
of developing breast cancer in her lifetime. Most high risk women
(20 percent of the female population) have not an 80 or 90 percent
chance but a 24 percent shot.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, whether they care about being a 36B or not, more U.S.
women are killed by heart disease than by all other cancers
combined.

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Please don't misunderstand. I am definitely not
against progress, not even if it's spelled with a capital ``P,'' or
for that matter if its rendered as PROGRESS.
</P>
<P>
   I write on a computer and use e-mail daily. Research is abetted
by access to the Internet. Voice mail often permits life to proceed
more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the new technologies which are nosing their way
into everyday lives are welcome and helpful. You can shop for a
yacht by phone, for all I know, and be perfectly happy with the
result.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all is not peaches and cream.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for one example, the phone calls we get of an evening,
usually after supper. On the other end is what the speaker
obviously hopes will be considered a solicitous voice, asking to
speak to Mr. Rosenfield. Being swift of mind, I immediately sense
that this is not exactly an intimate of mine. Sometimes the hopeful
voice at the other end is seeking a Mr. Rosenford. This puzzled me
for a while, until I figured out that when I hurriedly print my
surname it could, conceivably, if you want to be picky and
difficult, be read as Rosenford instead of the
what-should-be-plain-to-everyone Rosenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Upon confessing to my identity, I am barraged with a flow of
words so rapid and ill-spoken that I find it difficult to grasp
just what is being said. I do make out that this is a call from a
phone system or a credit card company, of which I am reassured by
the voice, I am a treasured customer. I further decipher that
because I am such a fantastic client _ one in a thousand, if not
better _ they are offering me a fabulously new and larger and
better arrangement that will make my existence on Earth a heck of a
lot pleasanter, even though my costs might possibly go up a teensy
bit.
</P>
<P>
   Being unsure just exactly what blessing is being proferred, and
not wishing to forego such a potential benefit, I ask for their
proposal to be sent to me in writing so that I might study it and
render a competent decision.
</P>
<P>
   There follows a pause on the other end of the line. After a
momentary hesitancy, the voice again takes up the sales pitch. When
I interrupt to say that I insist on a written offer, the
exasperated reply is ``But we have nothing in writing.'' No
kidding. Nothing to be had in black and white, to be able to review
and think about. Instead, the people who unleash these pitchmen
want an on-the-spot decision on the basis of an incomprehensible
phone call made by people who clearly have not specialized in
elocution.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, poor enunciation is not the annoyance your
experience when you place a phone call these days to many a
business enterprise. Awaiting you at the other end is a perfectly
distinct voice that for all its comprehensibility has a certain
deadly quality to it.
</P>
<P>
   You hear from this voice a recitation of the multifarious
activities that transpire, apparently with regularity, under this
office's roof, in which you were seeking human contact with just
one single soul out of the multitudes apparently rattling around in
there.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that you have merely to listen and evaluate a myriad of
choices, at the end you have to remember which of the options
offered approximates your needs the best.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to have a pad and pen handy, so that you could rapidly
take notes on the catalog that is being recited. If you are, say,
``discomfited'' by this, think how many more pennies are moving to
the bottom line of the business that has substituted mechanical
intelligence for the human kind.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, your valuable time has been chewed up accommodating
yourself to their peculiar idea on how to make friends and
influence people.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of abuse goes on and on. The guise is that better
service is being delivered; the actuality is that it makes a sham
of service.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the people who run the subways not only cleaned up
the cars, which themselves have been updated. They have also
installed a loudspeaker system that is designed to inform riders of
the station which they have reached as well as the name of the one
coming up next.
</P>
<P>
   What a splendid idea, especially for a city to which tourists
flock. The problem is that the crackles that emanate from the
system are useless because they cannot possibly be understood. To
the avidly listening straphanger, it is not apparent whether it is
the fault of the speaker or of the system or both.
</P>
<P>
   Here a perfectly good idea is wasted because it doesn't begin to
deliver the goods reliably.
</P>
<P>
   So many of the contemporary applications of technologies require
more than a second look, both by those who purport them as an
improvement for our way of life, and by all of us who are being
afflicted by innovations that have run amok or gone awry. Enough,
already.

FAMILY SEEKS JUSTICE FOR DRIFTER WHO DIED ON JAILHOUSE FLOOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ Mark Bailey was a Penobscot Indian who drifted
down from New England years ago in search of a place in the sun,
only to wind up dead at the age of 39 on the floor of the Escambia
County Jail on a winter morning a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Unheralded in life, Bailey has become the center of controversy
in death and a symbol of the misery that can grow from a brief
spasm of violence in a combustible setting where prisoners and
guards gnaw at each others' emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Bailey's family and inmates at the jail say he was
beaten to death by a gang of corrections officers after he struck a
woman jailer. After nearly five months of inquiries and multiple
autopsies, the state has reached no conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting on the medical examiner's report, and then
we'll proceed,'' said Michelle Kiefer, public information officer
for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. She said Sheriff Jim
Lowman and other officials had been instructed by county
supervisors not to discuss the case with the press.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bailey, the 20-year-old son of the victim, said: ``He died
with a little help from them in jail. I'm sort of confident about
what's going on, but it's aggravating how slow it's been.''
</P>
<P>
   After Dr. William Bell, an associate medical examiner for
Escambia County, quickly concluded that Bailey did not die at the
hands of the officers, lawyers representing Bailey's family
retained Dr. Ronald Reeves, a former official in another Florida
county who calls himself ``the people's medical examiner'' and
offers his services to trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves declared the officers responsible for Bailey's death. But
because of his controversial position, he was replaced with a Miami
pathologist who is studying the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Department of Law Enforcement intervened by bringing
in a medical examiner from Pinellas County to conduct a third
autopsy. The FBI has also entered the case, according to Bailey's
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, sworn statements have been collected from
several inmates who said they saw Bailey beaten to death. The
accounts differ, but O'Gwen King, one of the lawyers involved in
the case, said, ``Anytime you take statements from that many
people, you're going to get some discrepancies. These are
remarkably similar stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey had never amounted to much since coming here more than 20
years ago _ from Vermont, the family's lawyer believes. Divorced,
with two sons, he worked as an itinerant house painter. Much of the
time, he drank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he could drink heavy,'' said his son. ``Other times,
he didn't drink at all. He started realizing he had a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He went through a treatment program for alcoholism in late 1998,
then in the first week of the new year, something snapped. Fueled
by liquor, Bailey had an argument with his girlfriend, Tanya
Thomas, and bolted from her rural home a couple of hours before
dawn on Jan. 5. After he pounded on the door of a nearby mobile
home, the sheriff's office was called.
</P>
<P>
   According to the deputies' report, Bailey gave conflicting names
and dates of birth, then ``assumed a fighting stance and began to
yell.'' A big man weighing more than 200 pounds, he was wrestled to
the ground and booked at 5:50 a.m. on charges of resisting arrest
and assaulting an officer. He was put in Cell Five by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Around 7 a.m., Mary Durell, taking a roll call, entered Bailey's
cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, this lady officer was backing out real fast,
holding her mouth,'' said James Cook, a 47-year-old who was in jail
at the time, in a sworn statement. ``Two or three officers grabbed
Mr. Bailey and pulled him out of the cell, and by that time two of
them were on the radio calling `Code Red.' ''
</P>
<P>
   According to Cook's statement, and testimony given by other
inmates in an adjacent cell, a number of officers rushed to the
scene, subdued Bailey and began pummeling him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officers was coming from everywhere but except the sky,'' said
Robin Ball, who said she witnessed the fracas on her way to the
jail infirmary. ``They was just kicking him with boots like army
boots that you're wearing for a war. He was already dead when they
took him around the corner and beat him some more. About 10 of them
was beating him, and some was kicking him every which way but
loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook said: ``They threw him flat on his face and handcuffed him
. . . One of the officers stood on Mr. Bailey's head and just
jumped up and down on his head and also on his back. . . . I
haven't never seen a man get beat like that in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has suggested a racial motive.
</P>
<P>
   When Bailey no longer struggled, Holland said, one of the
officers uttered an expletive and said: ``Call 911.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey was pronounced dead at 7:22 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Photos of Bailey's corpse show a body wrecked. His face and arms
were bruised, his foot gashed. A medical examiner's incisions left
wounds like bright red ceremonial flowers on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man was tore up,'' said his daughter-in-law, Kristen
Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   After several weeks in the morgue, the body was finally turned
over to the family. ``I guess you could say he was put to rest,''
said his son. ``I know part of him's in the ground, but I didn't
like the way it had to be done.''

 UNDATED: ... an interview.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Letterman-like, O'Brien is willing to bite the hand that feeds
him. Visiting a new NBC merchandise store, he pronounced it a
``rip-off'' and tore up a T-shirt. After sampling food cooked by
Martha Stewart, he fell to the ground, gasping ``Constricting air
passage!'' as a nonplussed Stewart looked on.
</P>
<P>
   The bits on ``Late Night'' have an endearingly cheesy,
let's-put-on-a-show-in-the-garage quality. My favorite is when, on
a darkened stage, O'Brien and Richter hold flashlights under their
chins to create a ``spooky'' aura while they take hilarious
glimpses into the distant future, ``all the way to the year 2000.''
With any luck, O'Brien will be a fixture all the way to the year
2030. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DENNIS MILLER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The host's sardonic voice _ literally and figuratively _ defines
this show.``Dennis Miller Live'' builds toward ``The Rant.'' The
stage goes dark until only Miller is visible _ eyes glittering,
mouth twisted in a grin that tells you he is ready for takeoff _
and Miller mutters ``Now, I don't want to get off on a rant here .
. .'' And then he does. His verbal tempo accelerating with each
sentence, Miller careers across the contemporary landscape,
inveighing against the collapse of the culture on a dozen different
fronts.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, here is Miller in high rant last February on the
loss of privacy: ``You've got a better shot at hearing Charlie
Sheen deliver the keynote address at a Promise Keepers rally than
you do at maintaining anything that even vaguely resembles a
private life.'' With a healthy complement of four-letter words to
punch home his points, Miller takes full advantage of the greater
license afforded by HBO. Because his show is only a half-hour, the
interviews don't drag on, and Miller is unusually willing to
slam-dunk a guest. ``I don't want to hear the mushroom story,'' he
snapped at one fellow who was about to indulge in a drug tale.
</P>
<P>
   Miller takes viewer calls during his interviews, a seldom-seen
gambit that allows the host to showcase his ad-lib celerity. When
one young caller asked what college Miller wanted to go to when he
was 18, he shot back: ``I always thought that I'd go to the College
of Cardinals, 'cause I'd look the most limber.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with Miller there is always the smugness factor. Most
of the time, he seems mighty pleased with himself and his brand of
high-IQ comedy. But then again, most of the time on ``Dennis Miller
Live'' he has reason to be. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CRAIG KILBORN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not so Kilborn. He always had his detractors when he hosted
``The Daily Show'' _ chiefly they objected to his smirk _ and so
far (he took over for Tom Snyder on March 30) he seems bent on
proving them right.
</P>
<P>
   Long on self-congratulation, short on laughs, ``The Late Late
Show'' needs better writers, pronto, because many of Kilborn's
jokes fall with a thud. As an interviewer, Kilborn has lost the
sure-footedness that characterized his stint on ``The Daily Show,''
resulting in conversations that are insipid even by the lax
standards of late-night chat. Kilborn to Heather Locklear: ``You're
beautiful, and you've been a hit for so long on three shows.''
Locklear: ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   With bits like ``Let's Enjoy My Hair'' and a segment where he
stands near a window and ``reflects on a job well done,'' Kilborn
strives for self-aware irony but often comes up empty. He is
capable of a certain spacy likability, and the ``Five Questions''
routine _ Kilborn queries guests along the lines of ``Which
20th-century philosopher had the best table manners?'' _ is a
winner. He should build on that, jettison the rest, and hope for a
Conan-style recovery from a disastrous debut. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHRIS ROCK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With his screechy voice and a willingness to say anything,
anything at all, Rock has the clearest point of view of the
late-night talk-show hosts.
</P>
<P>
   His comic style is to aim for, and often achieve, a state of
constant uproar. The more touchy the topic _ such as race relations
_ the more Rock likes it. Here is Rock's take on gang warfare in
New York: ``Officials say the increase is the result of the Bloods
trying to compete with the two most violent gangs in New York City,
the Latin Kings and the NYPD.''
</P>
<P>
   Guests, too, had better come prepared to defend themselves. Rock
needled Vivica A. Fox for her role in ``Booty Call'' (``When you
saw the script that says `Booty Call,' what was going through your
mind? `I got a booty'?'') and twitted Bryant Gumbel for enjoying
golf, observing ``Golf is very white.'' Shrewdly, Rock doesn't
spare himself from the general raillery, as when he described his
sex-starved teenage years: ``I was 30 pounds lighter, I had braces,
I had glasses. (Expletive,) I was birth control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chris Rock Show'' returns to HBO in September (he
alternates with Miller, whose show runs from January through
August). &QL; 
 &QL; 
JON STEWART &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since he succeeded Kilborn as anchor of ``The Daily Show'' in
January, Stewart hasn't exactly had to hunt for material, since the
show is structured as a mock newscast and current events provide no
shortage of comic fodder.
</P>
<P>
   The format _ news footage punctuated by wisecracks from the
anchor desk _ lends a topicality and immediacy to the show, and the
jokes are usually pretty good, though Stewart sometimes leans on
obvious targets: British cuisine, Boris Yeltsin's drinking habits.
The four-minute limit on interviews keeps the show moving along, as
does Stewart's deadpan way with an out-of-left-field question. He
caught Angelina Jolie by surprise by saying: ``You've done a lot of
love scenes, but oddly enough, none with Jon Stewart. Does that
hurt?''
</P>
<P>
   But the best part of ``The Daily Show'' (which airs weeknights
at 11 p.m. on Comedy Central) is the taped segments, an
increasingly common feature of late-night comedy shows. The ``Daily
Show'' correspondents have a real knack for finding oddballs: a man
who is running for president while dressed as a lobster; some
survivalists gathered at a Y2K convention (``God wouldn't permit me
to kill anybody,'' one woman said solemnly. ``But I've prayed about
it, and I think I could maim somebody''); and a guy who is selling
real estate on other planets.
</P>
<P>
   Back here on earth, as viewers of Conan, Chris, and Company can
attest, some of television's choicest real estate can be found on
late night.

BROADWAYS'S SEARCH FOR REASONS TO BELIEVE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the beginning of his one-man play about the Middle
East, ``Via Dolorosa,'' David Hare declares that he recently
realized, ``almost without noticing, that for some time my subject
as a playwright has been faith. My subject is belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Hare's mission may be to seek out true believers, but that
hardly makes him a missionary. He envies the Arabs and Israelis
their fervor while being too aware of its destructiveness to adapt
any such passions himself. Conversely, all around him in England he
sees the rigor mortis of a life without that passion. That's the
horrible irony of Western civilization at the millennium, as he
tells the audience:
</P>
<P>
   ``People always say in England we lead shallow lives. Our lives
must be shallow because we live in a country where nobody believes
in anything any more. My whole life I've been told: `Western
civilization? An old bitch gone in the teeth.' And so people say,
go to Israel. Because in Israel at least people are fighting. In
Israel, they're fighting for something they believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   That quest for something to believe in hovers over all the new
Anglo-Irish plays on Broadway, a quintet of plays that asks
questions about living the meaningful life in a world seemingly
without meaning. It isn't a new question, by any means. In fact,
the godfather of all such plays is winding down its run on
Broadway: the great British adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's ``The
Iceman Cometh,'' with Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonists of ``Via Dolorosa,'' ``Amy's View,''
``Closer,'' ``The Weir,'' and ``The Lonesome West'' are all, in
their way, trying to find something to believe. Rooting for them
can be as hard as rooting for the Red Sox, and ultimately just as
productive. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Via Dolorosa'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all of them, Hare's one-man show is the most heartfelt and
intriguing, even if its subject matter makes it the least likely to
stand the test of time. The passions that fire the Middle East
conflict won't abate anytime soon, but the specifics will shift
enough to undermine the play. Still, one doesn't hold that against
``Fires in the Mirror,'' so there's no point in lamenting the
limitations of ``Via Dolorosa.'' Hare comes across, in fact, as a
combination of Anna Deavere Smith and Spalding Gray. Though he is a
less accomplished stage presence, he does combine Smith's ability
to bring polarized passions to life and Gray's irony of the
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the riveting tour of the area's strange politics,
there is the haunting sense that we would kill for a taste of the
meaningfulness of life in the Middle East, even if we wouldn't
dream of actually giving up our comforts for such a dangerous
environment. Hare's sense of humor keeps most of the audience with
him, even those in New York whose sympathies are more likely to be
with Israel than are Hare's.
</P>
<P>
   At a Q &AMP; A in Israel, Hare laments how Tony Blair has come to
symbolize the lack of passion in British life: ``What does he
believe? Nobody knows. What will he do? Whatever is popular. Where
is he heading? He never tells us. At once, an Israeli actor
interrupts, `Oh please, please, send us your Tony Blair.' '' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Amy's View'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The occasion of that interchange was a performance in Israel of
``Amy's View,'' a play that Hare wrote for Judi Dench and is almost
certain to give her a Tony to go with her Oscar this year.
Unfortunately, it is not a play remarkable for anything other than
Dench's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Dench plays Esme Allen, an actress whose faith and belief are in
the power of art, theater specifically, and if she's the flag
bearer of a dying cause, then she's prepared to go down fighting
against the pop-culture barbarians at the gate. Chief among those
barbarians is Dominic, the son-in-law who has wrested her daughter,
Amy, away from her.
</P>
<P>
   Had Hare invested Dominic with a fraction of the intelligence or
articulateness that he gives to both the Arabs and Israelis,
``Amy's View'' might have something to say about what makes Tom
Stoppard, for example, more worthy of attention than Quentin
Tarantino, a filmmaker in whose footsteps Dominic will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Hare not do that, he also fails to square the
circle between the political and personal. That is, whenever the
confrontation between high art and pop art starts to percolate,
Hare disconnects and switches to a rather tedious domestic drama.
There is a connection, but Hare doesn't make it worth the effort to
find it _ meaning that when Esme declares at the end, ``So we're
alone,'' it doesn't have the force it should.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, seeing great actors in the service of their
art is reward enough for many _ witness Julie Harris and Charles
Durning in ``The Gin Game.'' And there's no doubt that Dench is as
good as they come these days. But as Hare proved in ``Plenty'' with
Kate Nelligan and ``Skylight'' with Michael Gambon, there's nothing
like a great performance in the service of a fine play. For that
matter, even though Hare himself will never be confused with a
great actor, ``Via Dolorosa'' proves that the play is so much more
the thing than the player. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Closer'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the sense that today's Britain (and, by extension,
America?) is a spiritual wasteland stronger than in Patrick
Marber's second play, ``Closer.'' It is the best pure play of the
five, though whether Marber makes his case convincingly enough is
hotly debated by audiences when the curtain goes down.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of ``Closer'' are thoroughly depressing _ sex
makes the world go round, be it on the Internet or between the
sheets. The perfect life is the search for the perfect poke. All
four of the characters in ``Closer'' believe that to some extent,
even if the two women _ played by Anna Friel and Natasha Richardson
_ try to invest their lives with something more. Friel's young
waiflike character, in particular, will come to symbolize a quest
for a life in which matters like sacrifice and honor might still be
possible. In that sense she and Marber are reminiscent of Hare in
``Via Dolorosa.'' The quest for something to have faith in is not
limited to religion and ideology, though it isn't at all clear what
might take their places.
</P>
<P>
   Marber's gifts as a humorist and linguist are even sharper than
in his first play, ``Dealer's Choice,'' as is his ability to make
his work seem fresher than the latest hip movie. And it doesn't
hurt to have a great cast (better than the one I saw in London) at
your service. Ciaran Hinds (``Persuasion''), Friel, and Richardson
are terrific, though Rupert Graves seems a bit too placid as the
least sympathetic member of the foursome. I'm still not sure Marber
makes the case, but it's certainly an experience watching him try
to get there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The Weir'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moving across the sea, Conor McPherson is the third of the hot
Irish playwrights of the moment, along with Sebastian Barry (``The
Steward of Christendom'') and Martin McDonagh. The search for
meaning isn't as cosmic in ``The Weir'' as in the above sons of
``The Iceman,'' which makes its simpler sense of story more widely
enjoyable. There's a lightness of being represented, but it isn't
at all unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, ``The Weir'' owes more to ``The Iceman Cometh''
than any of the other plays. We're in an Irish bar where a group of
people will exchange stories that gradually strip away their
illusions. Set in a rural part of Ireland, ``The Weir'' starts out
with ghost stories that might be the Irish equivalent of ``Tales
From the Crypt'' or the old TV series of the paranormal ``One Step
Beyond.'' The atmosphere and the accents lend a pleasant creepiness
to the proceedings, but as the night wears on, the stories get more
real and, ironically, more haunting. That McPherson doesn't ask
bigger questions gives ``The Weir'' a pleasant enough taste to roll
around on one's lips, but after it's digested there's the
unpleasant question, ``Is that all there is?'' (The production of
another McPherson play, ``This Lime Tree Bower,'' opened this
week.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lonesome West'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McPherson takes it for granted that life, as depressing as it
sometimes might be, is worth living. If Hare concludes ``So we're
alone,'' McPherson sees hope in the comfort of community.
</P>
<P>
   To which Martin McDonagh would say, ``Give me a break.''
(Actually, he would insert a trademark adjective before ``break''
but we won't get into that.) If McDonagh had written ``The Weir,''
the denizens of the bar would have so frightened themselves with
ghost stories that there'd be as much blood as beer flowing by the
end of the play.
</P>
<P>
   McDonagh makes Samuel Beckett look like a cockeyed optimist. If
Beckett's credo is ``I can't go on, I must go on,'' McDonagh's is
``I can't go on, I might as well blow Da's brains out.'' And he's
more successful commercially than Barry and McPherson because,
among other things, his writing is hysterically funny.
</P>
<P>
   The key to black comedy is to leave the audience laughing so
hard that there's no room to complain. This doesn't work in all
cases, as could be attested to by a chorus of boos rising at the
end of the play. And though I was laughing as hard as anyone,
particularly in the first act, I wasn't altogether unsympathetic to
the boo birds.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for meaning by any of the above playwrights is a
fool's errand to McDonagh. It's symbolized in ``The Lonesome West''
by a priest whose kindhearted ineffectualness would be chilling if
McDonagh didn't have us in stitches. (This is the third part of
McDonagh's Leenane trilogy; the first, ``The Beauty Queen of
Leenane,'' will be coming to Boston next season. Jon Platt and
Pace/SFX have money invested in ``The Lonesome West,'' so that
could tour here as well. An unrelated McDonagh play, ``The Cripple
of Inishmaan,'' is currently at the ART in Cambridge.)
</P>
<P>
   Father Welsh is the parish priest in Leenane, where ``murder,
mayhem, and miserliness'' are the rule of the day. (So much for
McPherson's comfort of community.) At the center of the action are
two brothers whose abilities to get under each other's skin will
leave the priest's attempt to find faith, belief, or any kind of
order in a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   McDonagh can seem like the most scathing critic of contemporary
life we have. He can also seem like a Howard Stern for the
intelligentsia, something of a one-trick pony. I have a feeling
that the best is yet to come for both McDonagh _ ``The Cripple'' is
a better play than ``Lonesome West'' _ and Marber (and for Yasmina
Reza, whose ``Art'' is also in New York). But then I have a sense
of hope that none of the characters in ``The Lonesome West'' or
``Closer'' would be caught dead contemplating.

WHAT CAUSES HEADACHES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What causes headaches?
</P>
<P>
   T.S., E.P., Mattapan, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It depends on what kind of headache you have. Scientists
don't understand the causes of tension, the most common, or
cluster, the most excruciating. But they're starting to make some
big discoveries about the causes of migraine.
</P>
<P>
   In all three kinds of headaches, we do know what hurts. Dr.
Michael Moskowitz, Professor of Neurology at Harvard, says it's the
pain-sensing nerves woven through the blood vessels in your head,
and through the meninges, the three-layered sac that contains your
brain. Brain cells themselves have no pain sensors.
</P>
<P>
   The most common kind of headache is the tension headache.
According the Dr. Michael Cutrer, Director of the Partner's
Headache Center at Brigham and Women's and Mass General Hospitals,
as many as eight people in ten will suffer tension headache at one
time or another. It's a moderate intensity bilateral (both sides)
squeezing that lasts from minutes to weeks. There's no throbbing to
a tension headache, and no nausea or aura, the visual perception
that accompanies migraines. This is the kind of headache that
responds to over-the-counter medication.
</P>
<P>
   Least common are the cluster headaches. Men get them six times
as often as women. They cause extreme pain in and around one eye,
like a boring or searing through the eye for 15 minutes to three
hours. They are usually accompanied by red eye or tearing or
nostril dripping or sweating on the forehead, all on the same side
as the pain. They come in clusters of one or more per day over a
period of weeks or months, then disappear for months or years, then
recur. They're called ``the suicide headache'' because they're so
ferocious.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say there are three great pains in life,'' Dr. Cutrer
says. ``Childbirth, kidney stones, and cluster headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-most common headache is migraine. Between 12 and 15
percent of the population suffers migraine headaches. Women have
migraines three times more than men. Two thirds of women migraine
sufferers experience them around menstruation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cutrer says migraine is a unilateral (one sided) throbbing
headache with moderate or severe pain that can last from a couple
hours to three days. It is usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting,
and/or abnormal sensitivity to light or smell. Known triggers, in
addition to menstruation, include certain foods (aged cheese,
chocolate, caffeine, citrus fruits), exercise, and changes in
weather or season.
</P>
<P>
   Migraine usually follows some kind of anticipatory symptoms. 15
percent of migraine sufferers report a visual aura 20 to 40 minutes
before the pain starts, a shimmering sparkling image or a small
blind spot that spreads slowly to obscure half the field of vision
of each eye. Other anticipatory sensations include a tingling in
the hand and lower arm that jumps to the face, mouth and tongue,
motor weakness in the muscles on one side of the body, a craving
for certain foods, mood change, even the inability to recall words.
</P>
<P>
   The visual aura is providing neurologists with their first big
clues about the root causes of migraines, and possibly all
headaches. Dr. Margarita Sanchez and Dr. Nouchine Hadjikha of Mass
General Hospital have studied patients whose migraines have
specific triggers. They put them in a functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) machine, which can ``see'' blood flow in the brain
and tell which cells are active. It's literally like watching the
living brain at work. Then, with the patient's patience and
permission, they trigger a migraine.
</P>
<P>
   The fMRI reveals brain activity that's never been seen before,
an unusually slow spreading of activity across the parts of the
brain known to be the centers for vision, at the same speed the
patients say their visual aura spreads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know of nothing in the human brain that fires slowly this
way,'' Dr. Moskowitz says. ``The brain usually sends signals at
meters per second. This is millimeters per minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The brain activity causes the release of chemicals including
hydrogen ions, potassium, serotonin, histamines, and arichidonic
acid. Released in measured ways they don't create pain. But when
something triggers the unusually slow brain activity that's been
recorded in migraine patients, the release of these chemicals
becomes unmeasured, and they build up, Says Dr. Moskowitz.
</P>
<P>
   They have to be cleaned out of the system. That's what the blood
vessels do. When this particular mix or soup of chemicals builds
up, it's enough to stimulate the pain-sensing nerves in the blood
vessels and the meninges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the body the pain system is a natural warning
system. When it goes off it's telling us that something's wrong,''
Moskowitz explains.
</P>
<P>
   It's no different in the head. Dr. Moskowitz thinks migraines,
and possibly other headaches, may be our body's way of warning us
that we're doing something harmful to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the very early stages of defining these events and
trying to classify them,'' Dr. Moskowitz says. ``We've only had
tools like fMRI for a little while. But I'm confident we'll know
what causes migraine headaches, and maybe the other types, within
the next ten years.''

MEMOIR'S SPY CHARGES SPUR DEBATE AMONG SCIENTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It was supposed to be a kind of detective
story, the clever unmasking of the identity of a former Manhattan
Project scientist who may have passed atomic secrets to the Soviets
during World War II. Instead, it has turned into an acrimonious
battle to preserve the reputation of one of the nation's most
revered scientists, MIT's Philip Morrison, after charges of
espionage were leveled against him by a respected public-interest
activist and author.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the story especially odd and poignant is that the two
men were longtime friends. They are unlikely to be again.
</P>
<P>
   The story exploded with the publication last month of a memoir
by Jeremy Stone, son of the crusading independent reporter I.F.
Stone and, for the last 30 years, president of the Federation of
American Scientists. In the book's next-to-last chapter, he details
a series of conversations and visits with a scientist he calls
Scientist X, who he comes to believe was a Soviet spy, code-named
Perseus.
</P>
<P>
   But Scientist X was easily identified as the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's Morrison, who then sent Stone a letter
detailing clear-cut discrepancies that show he could not have been
Perseus. Stone responded with a terse letter acknowledging the
discrepancies, and saying that ``I can only accept your denial that
you are Perseus.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Stone's failure to apologize for his allegations or to
change the book, some members of the federation are debating
whether stronger remedies may be appropriate. Documents summarizing
the tale were sent to members of the federation's governing board
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just outraged'' by the unsubstantiated charges in
Stone's book ``Every Man Should Try,'' said Priscilla McMillan, a
professor at Harvard University's Russian Research Center and
secretary of the federation. Despite Stone's attempts to conceal
Morrison's identity, she said, ``anybody who knew anything about
the history of the Manhattan Project would know who it was.''
</P>
<P>
   While both men are held in high regard, several scientists and
historians contacted by the Globe who know them both expressed
dismay at Stone's actions and unreserved support for Morrison. ``I
think Phil is unscathed by this,'' said Frank von Hippel, chairman
of the federation's nonprofit foundation.
</P>
<P>
   As for Stone, von Hippel said, ``some people would like him to
apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   It began with the 1991 publication of a series of articles by
Colonel Vladimir Chikov, and then a 1994 book by Pavel Sudoplatov,
both former KGB officials who mentioned Perseus as having been one
of a half-dozen scientists who they claim provided secret
information about the development of the atomic bomb to Soviet
agents during the war.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there were obvious discrepancies between Morrison and
the Perseus described by Chikov, making it clear that Morrison
could not have been that spy _ if, indeed, such a person ever
existed.
</P>
<P>
   But if Perseus was real, the articles make it clear that
Morrison was not the one. They refer to Perseus having been
recruited by the KGB during a visit to his ill parents in New York,
whereas Morrison's parents lived in Philadelphia at the time. And
they say that Perseus was fighting with the International Brigades
in Spain, whereas Morrison, as he pointed out in his letter to
Stone, ``was never plausible infantry material.'' Morrison,
stricken with polio as a child, always walked with a severe limp
and a cane.
</P>
<P>
   If the discrepancies were so clear, what led Stone to make his
identification in the first place? It all appears to have been
based on a turn of phrase and on interpretations of body language.
</P>
<P>
   The first clue, Stone says in his book, was a few sentences
attributed to Perseus in the Chikov article, describing his
motivations for providing atomic information to Russia. Unlike more
recent spy cases, there was no financial motive here; Perseus
apparently believed that for the United States alone to have the
bomb would be a dangerous and unstable situation, and that it was
important for the Soviet Union to join the nuclear club as quickly
as possible to restore a balance of power. Stone thought the
sentiments and one particular phrase sounded like the voice of his
friend Morrison _ even though, as he acknowledged, the quote had
been translated from English to Russian and back again and then
edited.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison not only denies the identification, he strongly eschews
the sentiments ascribed to the wartime Perseus. ``No, I didn't feel
that way,'' he said in an interview Friday. ``I think it's simply
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting this hunch that Perseus might be Morrison, Stone
recounts that in 1994, he visited Morrison and his wife twice to
try to sound them out. But, as he makes clear in the book, he never
actually stated what was on his mind, instead talking in broad
terms about Perseus and about trying to get that person to tell his
story.
</P>
<P>
   In those meetings, Stone says Morrison became so fearful that
his knees shook, and that Phylis Morrison's reactions seemed to
confirm his suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to written questions from the Globe, Stone
summarized his reasons for going ahead: ``The chapter was written
only because, in conjunction with everything else . . . during a
discussion of Perseus between myself and the Morrisons, Phylis
seemed to have actually identified Phil as Perseus by throwing a
fit, pointing at him, and urging me to reach a `tacit agreement'
with him while he sat there silently. I felt entrapped by this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morrison says that in pointing to him during that
conversation, Phylis was merely recognizing and reacting to the
still-unstated accusation by Stone against Morrison. And the
recalled quote is simply wrong, he says. The shaking knees,
Morrison said, were the result of aftereffects of his childhood
polio.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Morrison has been a long-term member of the
federation that Stone heads, and was instrumental not only in
hiring him, but in heading off an attempt to oust Stone from that
position years ago _ all of which Stone acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his written responses, Stone says that ``I have
always loved and admired Philip Morrison . . .'' His goal, he says,
is to persuade those people who participated in wartime espionage
to come forward and share their stories, in the interests of
history and to allow Americans to judge their motives for
themselves. And he acknowledges that ``it is entirely possible that
Perseus does not exist at all,'' and that ``obviously, Phil may
well be innocent of any violation of law whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether such statements will be enough to stave
off any attempt by the federation's board to demand further
response. Robert Park, a physicist and director of the American
Physical Society, although not a federation member, said he has
spoken with some members and that ``if there has not been already,
I would be astonished if there were not calls for his
resignation.'' In the meantime, he said, some members have already
talked about resigning in protest.

PARENTS SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Offering people advice on how to raise their kids
is touchy. They tend to get annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, what do you know about it?'' they demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, what business of it is yours?''
</P>
<P>
   So up front let me just say this: I raised two kids. I wasn't
perfect at it. The kids weren't perfect, either, believe me. They
turned out pretty well, though. In the context of the times in
which we live, guess what: That makes me an expert.
</P>
<P>
   Also, like it or not, how your kids behave has an impact on
other people _ on the community in which you live. If parents want
to go off on some mountaintop somewhere, live like hermits and
raise their kids to live on nuts and berries and shun the rest of
humanity, that's one thing. But if they're going to send those kids
off into the world to inflict themselves on other people, then
those parents have an obligation not only to their kids but to the
world they share with others.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, permit me to offer my humble opinion on the
conduct of two sets of parents _ and on the messages they're
sending both their own kids and the kids of other people:
</P>
<P>
   In the first case, a 12-year-old kid in the comfortable Albany
suburb of Guilderland was charged last May with showing up at
school with an M-16 ammunition clip. According to the cops, he'd
brought in the clip, which he'd stolen along with some live
ammunition rounds from a National Guard firing range, to convince
the other kids in the school that he was serious when he threatened
to kill some teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the school went nuts. The kid was suspended for the
rest of the year. He ended up in juvenile court charged with a
misdemeanor. The adjudication of that case is secret. That's
routine in juvenile court. Now the family is suing the school
system and the cops for $850,000. Yeah, The family's lawyer admits
that the kid stole the M-16 clip and the ammunition. But he alleges
that the kid never threatened anybody and that the cops and the
school slandered him.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, a 19-year-old senior at
Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk High School in the southern Albany suburbs
went to class the other day with his hair fashioned into 18-inch
spikes, dyed bright red. The school decided that was disruptive and
sent him home. The family told me that the school has no right to
tell their kid how to wear his hair and that he's going back with
the same fetching tonsorial affectation.
</P>
<P>
   So what are we left with here? We seem to be left with two sets
of parents pulling out all the stops to communicate to their kids _
and to everybody else's, by the way _ that they can do any loony
thing they please, and that their parents will wage total war
against any non-family authority figure who finds their conduct
objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Now nobody understands more vividly than I do just how tough it
is to raise kids. Few people realize, when they take on the job,
how huge a chore it'll be to get their progeny properly launched
into the world, socialized and civilized to function in it
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   But you either raise kids who understand that the larger society
has a reasonable right to object to stunts like ammunition clips in
school, and that there are rational rules that must be followed. Or
you raise kids who get the message that anybody who disapproves of
anything they might do can just go to hell, or, if they annoy you
sufficiently, be sent there by force.
</P>
<P>
   Given recent events, which message seems louder?
</P>

PUBLISHER IS NO PUSHOVER ON POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ For Joseph W. McQuaid, the new publisher and
president of the Manchester Union-Leader, the challenge during this
political cycle will be deciding which of the 11 Republican
candidates for president to back.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely McQuaid and the Union-Leader will be closely
scrutinized this campaign season for any hints of which candidate
will receive the paper's blessing, and which ones will feel its
wrath.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview, McQuaid, 50, expressed skepticism about the
hype surrounding Texas Governor George W. Bush. ``Let's see how Mr.
Bush does when he gets up here in June,'' he said. ``Let's see if
he takes any positions. He seems to be trying very hard not to do
so, so far.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is sarcastic about Governor Bush's refusal to take a
stand on a hate crimes bill before the Texas Legislature. ``That's
the kind of leadership I like to see,'' McQuaid said. ``He hasn't
taken a position on it because he might tick off people to the left
or the right and his 6 million advisers haven't told him what to do
yet, apparently.''
</P>
<P>
   On Patrick J. Buchanan, the paper's longtime favorite, McQuaid
noted that many people who worked for the commentator in 1996 are
supporting other candidates this time. And he was mildly irritated
that the Buchanan camp sent him a press advisory on a Monday at
noon for an event that was supposed to take place on Sunday. And
the event, he added, hadn't even happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't seem particularly well organized this time
around,'' said McQuaid.
</P>
<P>
   He called Steve Forbes ``the nicest billionaire'' he's ever met.
Gary Bauer is a very nice man, he said, and so is Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   He admires John McCain for holding up under torture in a North
Vietnamese prison camp and refusing early release, but he said his
positions on Kosovo ``are loopy.'' John Kasich, the Ohio
congressman, is ``a little too young,'' said McQuaid, though he
likes his tax-cutting ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there is Bob Smith, who has not yet taken my advice
to pull a reverse Jesse Ventura and not only get out of the
presidential race, but get out of politics altogether and go into
big-time wrestling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Republicans are so desperate to prevent Vice President
Al Gore from becoming president that they are coalescing around an
untested candidate, Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to look and see who the guy is before you
crowned him,'' he said. ``So that's what New Hampshire will be
about.''

DRIVING WHILE WHITE: THE WAY TO GET AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lately we've been reading about police profiling
and DWB, or Driving While Black. If you fit the profile of being
African-American, or Latino, the cops pull you over on any pretext,
or none at all _ especially if you're driving in a white
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   I want to talk about something that hasn't come up before: DWW,
or Driving While White.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if you're DWW? Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why white people don't know about it.
</P>
<P>
   As long as I stick close to traffic laws, I drive all over the
place in my bland Honda and never get stopped by the cops. I don't
even consider the possibility. Talk about different black and white
worlds. One world involves a black-and-white in the rearview
mirror, the other doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with us white people _ make that heterosexual,
middle-class white males _ is that we don't notice all the things
that aren't happening to us.
</P>
<P>
   We hardly notice that we're not excluded from corporate glass
offices, newspaper front pages or network sitcoms. We expect to be
excluded from jail and unemployment lines.
</P>
<P>
   This came to me at a newspaper meeting on diversity last week. I
realized it's hard to get people, especially white males, to talk
about race or gender politics in mixed company.
</P>
<P>
   Sex and money are much easier topics. We have huge national
conversations on sex and money, while Clinton's national
conversation on race never got past the first talking point.
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you, I have little white guilt. I'll tell a black
person where to get off, and I do about twice a week to San
Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. Not because he's black, but because
he's the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   I have suffered enough in life to know you should enjoy your
advantages. But know those advantages, and don't deny them.
</P>
<P>
   Many middle-class white men think they have overcome the same
kind of obstacles women and blacks have to overcome. Blacks and
women don't exactly see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago, Eddie Murphy did a great ``White Like Me''
segment on ``Saturday Night Live.'' At one point, Murphy, in
whiteface, went to a bank and the teller whispered, ``How much
money do you want?''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that easy, but in my time, 1,000 white men graduating
from Harvard faced exactly that question at job interviews. And I,
like an idiot, said, ``None, thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the noise about minority hiring, white privilege and
class privilege still exist.
</P>
<P>
   I first learned about Driving While White back in the late '60s,
although in those hippie times I thought it was DWN, Driving While
Neat.
</P>
<P>
   I had a friend who believed if he kept his hair short, dressed
well and drove a boring car, he could do anything. He also was
white. One night in rural Connecticut a cop pulled us over for a
minor infraction. The cop looked us over and sent us on our way.
</P>
<P>
   A mile down the road, my friend flipped open the glove
compartment. There was a bag of marijuana and a gun he had borrowed
from the Colt factory, where he worked.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson one: Never trust a friend not to be an idiot and get you
sent to prison as an armed drug smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson two: If you're an idiot, be white and middle-class and
you might get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Whites can't understand what it's like to be black in America _
that's the cliche and the truth. But white people also have to work
hard to understand what it's like to be white in America. We take
our membership in that big club for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the insight comes in a rush, like when a friend went
to the Department of Motor Vehicles and found he was the only white
man in line wearing a tie. The clerk moved him to the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was I supposed to do, say, `No, treat me badly, too?'''
my friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually we white, middle-class males don't see what we have _
and resent what little we think we're losing. We have to be put at
a huge advantage or disadvantage before our eyes open.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, sometimes a white male can be at a disadvantage. We see the
world from above. That's not a view that provides perspective.
</P>
<P>
   You have to get down to earth, or the road. Take a few drives
through rich, white neighborhoods and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing happens, good for you. Think about it.
</P>

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Summertime and the livin' is easy ... time to
relax with books and barbecuing.
</P>
<P>
   But don't fret if you live in an apartment and don't have room
for an outdoor grill that runs on liquid propane, natural gas or
charcoal briquettes.
</P>
<P>
   Keep that barbecue marinade at the ready, because T-Fal Corp. of
New Jersey has designed smokeless indoor grills to make barbecuing
a timeless indoor convenience.
</P>
<P>
   The Excelio Indoor grills are designed to sear meats and other
foods instantly, locking in their natural juices. The grills also
feature family-size removable cooking plates with T-Fal nonstick
coating for healthier, low-fat cooking and easy cleanups.
Smoke-free cooking is possible because the unit's heating element
is nested in a protective groove under the heavy gauge
cast-aluminum grill plate.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the nonstick ridged grill plate channels fats and
excess juices away from the food and heating element, preventing
smoke or flare-ups that happen when fat comes in contact with the
heat source.
</P>
<P>
   To operate the grill, pour about one quart of water into the
removable drip tray, plug in, preheat for approximately 10 minutes
and you're ready to cook.
</P>
<P>
   The Multi-Grill Excelio BBQ+Griddle by T-Fal features an
interchangeable nonstick coated griddle plate for cooking pancakes,
French toast, bacon, eggs, home fries and other breakfast and
brunch food.
</P>
<P>
   Both grills feature adjustable thermostats, on/off indicator
lights, cool-to-the-touch handles, fully removable, dishwasher-safe
drip trays and nonstick grill plates.
</P>
<P>
   The T-Fal Excelio Indoor BBQ retails for $89.99 and the Excelio
Indoor BBQ+Griddle for $109.99. Both come with full-color recipe
and instruction booklets.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ From across the room, he saw her, a young woman wearing
the flowing garb of her Muslim culture.
</P>
<P>
   And, from what Khaled Rawashdeh was told about the young woman
that day two years ago at a religious social, she was everything he
was looking for in a mate: Lebanese, a faithful Muslim, and a
member of a well-respected family in Boston. Yet he never said a
word to the 18-year-old. Instead, he walked into her father's
office days later and asked for her hand in marriage.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation that reached back to the young man's
family in Jordan, Mona Eid and her father agreed to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Mona and Khaled's journey to the altar is similar
to that of a growing number of young immigrants across the state
who, aware of this country's high divorce rate and struggling to
hold onto their cultural roots, are turning to a variation of a
centuries-old custom carried over from their homelands _ arranged
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our culture, love comes after marriage,'' said Mona
Rawashdeh, 20.
</P>
<P>
   While there is little statistical evidence on the prevalence of
marrying for economic, cultural, and religious reasons rather than
for love, members of the international community in Massachusetts
are increasingly turning to their parents to choose a mate, say
cultural leaders from the Asian, Indian, and Arab communities.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of these singles, aware of the evolving world in
which their children live, are beginning to use the Internet and
classified ads to help them with their matchmaking endeavors. In
July, Indian parents across the country will bring their children
between the ages of 21 and 35 to a matrimonial conference in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage is a mutual agreement between the family and the
woman,'' said Imam Talal Eid, Mona's father. ``If she says yes,
then we have to say yes. If one of us says no, then the deal is
off.''
</P>
<P>
   While such marriages rarely end in divorce, unlike nearly half
of American marriages, the idea of arranging to marry someone you
do not know goes against this country's tradition of what US
sociologists have dubbed ``love marriages.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with so-called love marriages, said Jamal Malek, a
member of the Islamic Center of Boston, is that relationships
between both sides of the family and economic and religious
differences are not taken into consideration until it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, sex and romance have been so much a part of the
American prenuptial relationship that romance soon withers, whereas
love is just beginning to blossom after couples like Mona and
Khaled are married, said Malek.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, the reason why they last,'' said Mona Rawashdeh, ``is in
my religion, marriage is something that is for your whole life. So
when you have that mentality that it's forever, whatever happens
you try to work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   But that success rate should be viewed only through cultural
prisms, according to Omar Khalidi, a professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Asian and Muslim cultures stay in bad marriages
because divorces, although allowed, are discouraged, said Khalidi.
``The individuals may not be happy, but they are not breaking up
because of societal pressures,'' he said. ``But, by American
standards, that's a lousy marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the days of old, when children were forced to marry their
parents' choice of mate, today the young are involved in the
process, and can choose not to marry at all.
</P>
<P>
   Quoc Huynh, 20, decided not to follow in his older brother's
footsteps. Last summer, his brother reluctantly traveled to their
native Vietnam to marry a bride of the family's choosing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm just too young to even think about it,'' said Huynh,
who plans to complete his studies at the University of
Massachusetts and seek a job rather than a wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many young people who say, `No `I don't want to
follow your system,' '' said Malek. ``So basically, we as parents
have learned you can only go to a certain extent with your
children. As they say, `You can drive a horse to water but you
can't make him drink.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While the Immigration and Naturalization Service saw a 40
percent increase between 1995 and 1996 in the number of green-card
holders requesting to bring their spouse to this country, laws are
tightening to secure against marriage fraud and abuse against
women.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago in Lincoln, Neb., a 39-year-old Iraqi arranged
the marriage of his two daughters, 18 and 14, to two Iraqis, ages
28 and 34, who had fled the Gulf War. The Islamic tradition ran
against the Nebraska law, so the girls were protected when they
fled; they were eventually placed in foster care. The adults were
charged with child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   While such incidents do happen, said Malek, most parents are
careful to make sure their child is marrying someone well adjusted,
economically sound, and from the same social class.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jayavendra, 29, will travel to his native India this
summer to marry someone not only of his culture but of the same
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dated women, but it was just important that when I got
married that I marry in the same caste system,'' said Jayavendra, a
member of the Brahmin caste, the highest in India's social class.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is nearing 30, Jayavendra decided, like his brothers
and sisters before him, to allow his parents to choose his
prospects. His parents made calls to families, visited homes, and
investigated eligible women. Then, they sent their son pictures of
India's loveliest and smartest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually kind of fun,'' said Jayavendra.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Khaled Rawashdeh, 27, was also planning to travel
to his native Jordan so his parents could help him find a bride.
But when friends told him about Mona, he decided he might not
travel to Jordan after all.
</P>
<P>
   He called her father's office and arrived with two other people
to introduce himself to the clergyman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I am looking to get married and I think your daughter
is what I am looking for. What do you think?' '' remembered
Rawashdeh.
</P>
<P>
   But Imam Talal Eid, who runs the Islamic Center of Boston, was
not in any mood to discuss a marriage proposal. ``I really wanted
Mona to finish the first year in college,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Eid himself had sought the help of his mother in finding a
wife 22 years ago when he was a young, busy clergyman in Lebanon.
The fruit of his mother's labor has lasted 20 years and produced
six children.
</P>
<P>
   Mona, his oldest daughter, and her suitor would sit in their
Quincy home on Sunday evenings like he and his wife did years
before, discussing their dreams and interests. Known as the
engagement period, it is when couples, who can call the wedding off
at any time, get to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I found what I wanted and nothing about her could turn
me off,'' said Khaled Rawashdeh. ``I couldn't ask for better.''

WRITERS DEBATE THE ROLE OF BOOKS IN THE WEB ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDYTH RIGLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writers Kurt Anderson (``Turn of the Century'') and Jon Katz
(``Running to the Mountain'') recently held a literary debate on
line. The choice of venues was appropriate, given that the debate
focused on the future of the ``traditional'' novel as books
proliferate on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't experienced this phenomenon firsthand, check out
Web locations sites www.1stbooks.com, www.sansip.com and
www.upublish.com, where ``virtual books'' appear and may be
downloaded from the Internet to any computer. These sites have been
a boon to authors who, for whatever reason, eschew the traditional
road to publication in favor of (almost) instant gratification and
the opportunity to reach millions of readers.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Katz addressed some tough questions springing from
this growing trend: Does the book have a future in cyberspace? And
_ certainly an even larger question _ does the text-based novel
have a future at all?
</P>
<P>
   These guys weren't a couple of Luddites bemoaning what
technology has done to the artiste; Andersen, co-founder and editor
of the cutting-edge Spy magazine, says he abandoned his typewriter
nearly two decades ago for the computer, he e-mails a couple of
dozen times a day and he couldn't have completed the research for
his new novel without the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, a contributing editor for Rolling Stone, writes on the Web
for Slashdot.org and is a confirmed Internet user.
</P>
<P>
   The two made a lot of good points. Andersen stressed that,
counter to popular opinion, the novel isn't dead; and if it's
wounded, ``the microchip isn't responsible.'' But he added that, at
least so far, what he's seen on the Internet _ with the exception
of on-line bookselling _ won't have any lasting impact on our
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is an important on-line literary (or cinematic or
musical) work?'' Andersen asks. ``Where's a hypertext masterpiece?
When does the renaissance begin. ... If I find it almost impossible
to be moved watching television, how on earth are streaming video
images on a monitor screen ever going to shake or enlighten or
entertain me in a deep, satisfying way?''
</P>
<P>
   Katz countered that members of the ``Holy Circle'' of publishing
houses, trendy magazines and other cultural insiders are merely
feeling threatened by the accessibility of the Net, where anyone
with a message can find an audience, where you don't need an agent
or a track record to get published. He sees the Internet as a
``barrier buster.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the established avenues through which we receive our
culture, Katz added, the Internet is an unknown. The institutions
are hidebound and uninspiring; the Internet is vibrant and
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   There's more food for thought within the debate _ which you can
find at www.randomhouse.com/atrandom/kurtandersen/ _ but perhaps
most intriguing is Katz's final salvo: ``Publishing will almost
certainly survive the Internet, but a fairer question might be
whether it really deserves to.''

RAY SHAMIE'S LAST CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone did Ray Shamie a kindness when he was 16 years old, and
he hasn't forgotten it.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1937, the depths of the Depression. His father had
been killed in a traffic accident, and the family was destitute.
Shamie, just out of high school, had to go to work so his mother
and siblings could eat _ but unemployment was at 25 percent, and
there was no work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't get any kind of a job in those days,'' he was
reminiscing the other day from his home in Florida. Fortunately,
someone in the neighborhood took pity on the Shamies and used his
connections to find young Ray a position. And so the truck driver's
son from Queens, an exceptionally bright kid with a talent for math
and science, entered the work force as a busboy, washing dishes and
mopping floors at a Horn &AMP; Hardart automat. Far from resenting his
menial job, he still, 62 years later, remembers with gratitude the
man who made it possible.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have given odds in 1937 that the penniless kid with
the mop would become a millionaire dozens of times over, the
founder of high-tech manufacturing firms that would put thousands
of men and women to work, a philanthropist who would share his
wealth with uncommon generosity?
</P>
<P>
   I first met Ray Shamie in the spring of 1981, soon after he had
decided to run against Edward Kennedy in the US Senate race in
Massachusetts the following year. I signed on as research director
to the fledgling campaign, even as he warned me that he was naive
in the ways of politics. (And, he might have added, in the ways of
politicians. ``I am not going to walk up to some goddam stranger
and try to shake his hand,'' he told me at an early campaign
appearance when I urged him to be more assertive about pressing the
flesh.)
</P>
<P>
   Challenging Kennedy was a hopeless long shot, of course, but
long shots have always been something of a Shamie specialty.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, the head of the manufacturing company he
worked for told him his notion of a miniaturized, flexible metal
diaphragm would never fly commercially. Shamie quit his job,
scraped together every dime he could beg and borrow, and launched
his own company, Metal Bellows Co. When medical researchers
proposed to fit Shamie's bellows into a drug-dispensing pump that
could be implanted in a patient's body, his business colleagues
panicked, afraid that the risks of liability would be too great.
Undeterred, Shamie began making the pump, ultimately launching a
second successful business, Infusaid Corp.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign against Kennedy was less of a success. Still,
Shamie earned high points for style and humor, and he succeeded in
shaming the senator into meeting him in a televised debate. On
Election Day, his message of lower taxes, limited government,
greater economic freedom, and support for President Reagan pulled a
more-than-respectable 40 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   I was with him two years later when he tried again. Shamie's
1984 Senate campaign was far more serious than the campaign against
Kennedy had been. Not because Shamie had changed _ he was still an
upbeat conservative, still an admirer of Reagan, still an ardent
believer in the power of individual iniative and human liberty. But
in 1984 he was taken seriously by the media and the political
establishment, especially after he demolished a famous Washington
icon, former Attorney General Elliot Richardson, in the Republican
primary. He lost the general election to John Kerry, in part
because of a sulfurous assault on his character and integrity by
The Boston Globe. (Such an attack would be unthinkable today; the
Globe's current editors would never allow it.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in losing, Shamie won. More than 1.1 million voters
cast their ballots for him, and he emerged as the most respected
figure in the Massachusetts GOP. His long shot had paid off, albeit
not in the way he'd intended.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is facing the longest odds of all. Cancer is eating his
vital organs. His energy is depleted, he has difficulty breathing,
and his weight is plunging. He had planned to spend the summer in
his new home on Cape Cod, but he has canceled his plans to fly up.
His doctors don't expect him to see the end of spring.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't given up hope, exactly _ ``Hell, I've been a positive
person all my life, about everything,'' he was saying a few days
ago _ but he also hasn't stopped being a realist. The man who once
quoted to me by heart Brutus's famous ``There is a tide in the
affairs of men'' speech from ``Julius Caesar'' knows better than to
count on a remission.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, it was his realism that led Shamie into politics in
the first place. He believed that most voters were like him, that
if given accurate information, they would choose the right leaders.
It saddened him to discover the truth _ that most ballots are not
cast on the basis of ideas and analysis but for irrational reasons:
emotion, blind party loyalty, even ethnic affiliation. He still
talks about the woman who approached his wife in a supermarket
during the 1982 campaign. ``I really like what your husband says, I
like what he stands for,'' the woman told her. ``But I have to vote
for Ted Kennedy. He came to my daughter's graduation.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans unhappy with politics as usual often lament: ``Why
don't more decent people go into politics.'' It will soon be time
to bid farewell to one decent man who did.

A MUST-HAVE CATALOG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE BARNES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We like simple, elemental furniture and thus were delighted with
a table in peopleplacesthings, one of several catalogs put out by
the J. Jill company. The table, available in three styles, is a
solid block of plantation-grown Costa Rican cypress. It's primitive
and purposeful _ proudly a place to set stuff. Weighing 80 pounds
and standing 17 to 21 inches high, the table comes in barrel,
concave or classic pedestal shapes. Even in you're not up to paying
$210 for the table, be sure to call to receive a copy of
peopleplacesthings, which is one of the classiest catalogs we've
seen. It's a perfected Pottery Barn, with cool items like metal
candleholders with small stones slipped in their hollow bases and a
remarkable, $2,300 hammered-tin armoire. Call 800-295-4378.
</P>
<P>
   PANDA TOASTER: Just what everyone needs: An $80 toaster that
bakes the face of a panda onto a piece of toast. Now, we understand
that people can feel strongly about their toasters _ we know
someone who likes to show off his new toaster at parties, and
Williams-Sonoma is selling a ton of those $400 retro-chrome
toasters _ but really, now. A panda on every slice of toast? Surely
a zeal for the cute critters from China has its limits. We'd
understand better if the toaster came with three or four
interchangeable elements that would allow you to switch to, say,
lizards, porcupines and koalas, depending on mood. Eighty bucks
seems like an awful lot to spend on a two-slice box of whimsy,
although whoever buys it for a $10 at a garage sale in 20 years
will be delighted. We found the toaster among the oddities in a
catalog called Lifestyle Fascination. Call 800-669-0987.
</P>
<P>
   OLD TUNES: As aurally impressive as they are, compact discs lack
the nostalgic appeal of records, especially the heavy old 78-rpm
platters. And there's no better way to play them than on a
gramophone. Lifestyle Fantasies catalog found an stash of old
gramophones, dating from the 1920s to the '50s, and had them
completely reconditioned, with some parts restored and others
recast. The brass horn is new, but most of the mechanicals and
casework are original, meaning no two are exactly alike. Each
features a side crank, chrome arm and felt-covered turntable and
comes with both a 78 record and a supply of needles. Curiously, the
catalog is a bit evasive about the origin of the gramophones,
saying only that they're from ``the British Colonies.'' Order the
$400 gramophone by calling 800-669-0987.

ALVIN ROCKWELL, PROMINENT LAWYER, DIES AT 90 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Alvin John Rockwell, a prominent San Francisco
lawyer who played a key role in shaping West Germany's democratic
government after World War II, died May 19 at Mount Zion Hospital
of coronary artery disease. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rockwell, a partner in the firm of Brobeck, Phleger and
Harrison, held a lifelong interest in international affairs. His
career led him from making radio addresses to the postwar German
public to honoring Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev during his
controversial visit to America in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Mr. Rockwell was president of the World Affairs
Council of Northern California. Khrushchev had just been denied his
request to visit Los Angeles and Disneyland when he was honored by
the council in a San Francisco dinner. Mr. Rockwell's reasoned
speech at that event was credited with helping to defuse the
tension that had built up around Khrushchev's U.S. tour.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rockwell's introduction to foreign affairs came in 1945,
when he moved to Berlin to serve as legal adviser to the commander
of the American forces occupying a portion western Germany.
</P>
<P>
   His assignment was to rebuild the German legal system, employing
aspects of German tradition and Western democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions he spoke directly to the people of Germany,
in public appearances and on the radio. His work is credited with
helping to shape what is now that nation's legal structure.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Kalamazoo, Mich., in 1908, Mr. Rockwell attended Albion
College in Michigan and DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind.,
where he served as student body president and a member of Sigma Nu
fraternity. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   After a postgraduate year at the London School of Economics, Mr.
Rockwell attended Harvard Law School. He graduated in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rockwell practiced law in Boston for a brief time, then
moved to Washington to serve in the solicitor general's office as
special assistant to the U.S. attorney general and as attorney for
the National Labor Relations Board. He argued many cases for the
government in defense of labor activity, and appeared several times
before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   After service in Germany, Mr. Rockwell came to San Francisco to
join Brobeck, Phleger and Harrison. His clients included United Air
Lines, the Matson Navigation Co. and the Homestake Mining Co. He
also served on Homestake's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 50 years, Anna Hayward Rockwell, died in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rockwell is survived by a sister, Gladys Osborne of Delray
Beach, Fla.; a son, John Rockwell, and a granddaughter, Sasha
Rockwell, both of New York City.

BRADLEY CHALLENGE TO GORE HAS A MODEL IN TSONGAS '92 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, the candidacy of presidential hopeful Bill
Bradley in 1999 is looking more like the candidacy of Paul Tsongas
in 1991 _ with a few key exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the acknowledged front-runner for the
Democratic nomination, would be wise to familiarize himself with
the surprise victory Tsongas pulled off in the New Hampshire
primary in 1992. If Gore did, he might take Bradley a little more
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The little-known advantage that Tsongas, the former US senator
from Massachusetts who died in 199xxxx, had eight years ago is
basically the same advantage Bradley has in the forthcoming 2000
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley shares many of the advantages that Tsongas had eight
years ago _ being perceived as a longshot; a special appeal to
voters seeking a fiscally conservative liberal; and a reputation
for being ``clean,'' with none of the kinds of problems that
President Clinton has faced and the fund-raising questions Gore is
still dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire voters also might like about Bradley some of the
things they liked about Tsongas: a dry sense of humor and a low-key
campaign style that allows him to look more human than many
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Two other New Hampshire primary winners had similar
characteristics _ Eugene McCarthy and former President Jimmy
Carter, both of whom positioned themselves as the alternative, if
not the anti-politician, candidate. Bradley appears to have a
similar appeal to New Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
   Tsongas was so appealing to Democrats in 1992 that registered
independent voters decided to take out Democratic ballots in the
primary to vote for Tsongas. Even though some of them wanted to
vote for GOP candidate George Bush that year, they assumed he would
win his battle against Pat Buchanan and thus opted to help Tsongas
edge out other Democratic hopefuls, including Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many independents who wanted to vote for Tsongas
that year that several towns in southern New Hampshire almost ran
out of Democratic ballots by the evening of election day.
Ironically, Tsongas's upset victory was almost overshadowed by
Clinton's second place finish ahead of two other Democrats, which
earned him the title as the ``comeback kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley appears to be positioning himself as the viable
independent alternative to Gore's heavily-financed candidacy. In
addition, Bradley's clean image could play well next to the
investigation of Gore's fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also key differences between the Tsongas and
Bradley campaigns that could hinder Bradley's chances of pulling
off an upset victory next year.
</P>
<P>
   Tsongas, for example, was so little-known, and viewed as such a
weak candidate, that New Hampshire's elected officials and
political operatives were unwilling to jump on his bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   However, some of Tsongas's early campaign advisers saw this not
as a liability, but as an advantage. The workers began building the
Tsongas campaign with community leaders rather than elected
officials, which gave Tsongas a non-political image that worked
well among New Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, while Bradley's candidacy is actually
stronger than Tsongas's was at these stages of their campaign,
Bradley's current campaign team may work against him. Instead of
surrounding himself with independent, non-political Granite State
community leaders, Bradley has been bringing in fairly well-known
political operatives. That costs him an image as an outsider, a
maverick.
</P>
<P>
   At this early point in the campaign, Bradley is a
well-established candidate who has to be taken serious; at this
point in the 1992 campaign, Tsongas was not taken seriously, even
in his home state of Massachusetts. It was Tsongas' low profile
that helped him to quietly build a community-oriented campaign team
that appealed to so many New Hampshire voters. In the end, Tsongas
enjoyed all the advantages of a candidate who came from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would do well to bring community-oriented people into
his New Hampshire campaign, such as the head of a town Little
League and President of a Rotary Club, as did Tsongas.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a lack of money forced Tsongas out of the race in
1992. Bradley, however, may have the financial resources necessary
to compete with the very financially able Gore, especially if he
upsets the vice president in next year's Granite State primary.
Gore, of course, is working hard to make sure that does not happen.
</P>
<P>
   With no incumbent president, the media spotlight is likely to
generate more national voter interest in both the GOP and
Democratic winners.
</P>
<P>
   If he hopes to do as well against Gore in the New Hampshire
primary as Tsongas did against Clinton, candidate Bradley in 1999
may have to become more like candidate Tsongas of 1992. And that
may be as tough a challenge for Bradley as being more like Clinton
is for Gore.

 TORCH IS PASSED AT N.H.'S CONSERVATIVE BEACON
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ These are tumultuous times for the New
Hampshire conservative. Taxes are on the table, the Legislature has
passed a gay foster parents bill, and the long-resisted Martin
Luther King holiday is expected to become law this session.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after more than half a century with a Loeb at the helm of
the Manchester Union-Leader, the state's most prominent
conservative voice, the torch is being passed from Nackey S. Loeb
to Joseph W. McQuaid, who has moved from editor to president and
publisher. McQuaid insists the Union-Leader's staunch ideology will
not wobble.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the 50-year-old, third-generation newspaperman
will be watched closely. He is taking over a storied newspaper from
a legendary family in a state, and a newspaper business, that are
changing quickly. He inherits a paper with a national reputation as
kingmaker in the Republican primary, but at a time when
conservatives in his own state worry about the fate of the
political philosophy the Union-Leader has so long championed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to hell in a handcar,'' declared Jim
Finnegan, the retired chief editorial writer for the paper. ``This
whole crusade to keep government as close to the people as possible
is in serious jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, though, the more immediate question is who among
the Republicans crisscrossing the state will get the golden nod.
McQuaid said he is still waiting to see how the field shapes up.
But he also hints that there could be trouble ahead for Texas
Governor George W. Bush and that longtime favorite Patrick J.
Buchanan, endorsed in 1996, may have lost his patron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what George W. is, whether he is conservative or
moderate,'' McQuaid said. ``So far, he's played a typical
politician's game and really not said much of anything on the
issues. Maybe he'll turn out to be a conservative, maybe he'll come
up here and turn out to be right of the Union-Leader.''
</P>
<P>
   On Buchanan, who called Nackey Loeb his political godmother,
McQuaid noted that the commentator had lost most of his
organization to other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on with Patrick J. Buchanan,'' said
McQuaid, whose wife, Signe, is not organizing for the candidate as
she did in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that rebuff is mild by Union-Leader standards. After 18
years as president and publisher, Loeb, who is 75 years old and in
frail health, has retired. Her husband, William Loeb, bought the
paper in 1946 and ran it, with a pen that was pointed and
frequently poisonous, until his death.
</P>
<P>
   He dubbed Richard Nixon's secretary of state, ``Kissinger the
kike,'' and he called Martin Luther King Jr. ``a pious, pompous
fraud.'' He wrote that the ``only good Communist is a dead
Communist,'' and avidly supported Senator Joseph McCarthy. He
called Buddhists and Muslims ``heathens'' and ``infidels.'' And he
repeatedly described Robert F. Kennedy as ``the most vicious and
most dangerous political leader ever to appear on the US scene.''
</P>
<P>
   William Loeb's legacy continues to reverberate today. He
fathered the anti-tax pledge, which most politicians needed to sign
to get elected. Governor Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, signed the
pledge, and spent much of this legislative session fending off
attempts to institute an income tax to pay for public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Nackey Loeb, heir to the Scripps-Howard publishing fortune, was
just as opposed to taxes, big government, and communism as her
husband, and just as quick to take a politician to task. Her words,
however, were written with a slightly softer tone.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan cited her endorsement in 1996 with helping him upset
Bob Dole in the New Hampshire primary. George Bush, on the other
hand, could never catch a break.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush was vice president, she wrote: ``We certainly don't
want someone who is either so stupid or so dishonest as president
of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   As McQuaid takes the helm, few in New Hampshire actually expect
to see the newspaper veer from its colorful course.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, with a daily circulation of about 63,000 and a
Sunday circulation of 85,000, has its detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say the Manchester Union-Leader frequently
does a better job tearing down a candidate than building one up as
it continually weighs in on campaigns, elections, and the issues of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they make up their mind that they don't like a candidate
and they editorialize six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 days in a
row, that has a terrific cumulative effect _ especially in the
Republican party,'' said Steve Duprey, chairman of the state GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, candidates avoid the newspaper at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot emerge as the dominant candidate of the right
without their endorsement,'' said Thomas Rath, a veteran Republican
strategist who is advising Lamar Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Union-Leader were to endorse George W. Bush, this race
would be over, stick a fork in it, he would be the nominee of the
party,'' said David M. Carney, a Republican political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if McQuaid decides to endorse Dan Quayle,
Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer or Buchanan, that candidate would likely
emerge as the alternative to Bush, said Carney.
</P>
<P>
   McQuaid said that he, his father, B. J. McQuaid (the Loebs'
first editor-in-chief), and William and Nackey Loeb have all shared
a similar philosophy over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many conservatives left and we have to stick
together,'' said McQuaid, who began working part-time for the
Sunday News as an office boy at age 15 and became editor of the
Sunday paper at 22.
</P>
<P>
   McQuaid is troubled by the current movement toward more taxes,
but he thinks a change is coming and that lawmakers should beware.
He's also dismissive of the suggestion that the King holiday or the
gay foster parents' legislation represents anything new in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the state has always been more liberal than it is
perceived from outside the state,'' he said. ``It's always been
more liberal than the Union-Leader would like it to be.''

PROVIDERS, PATIENTS LAMENT CONTRACT RESTRICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a Boston-area mental health counselor was forced late last
year to stop seeing nursing home patients she'd worked with for
five years because of a contract restriction, a woman in her 80s
who had come to depend on her was devastated.
</P>
<P>
   ``She turned her back to me and she wouldn't speak to me. There
were tears coming down her face,'' said the counselor, who did not
want to be named for confidentiality reasons. The patient, who was
bedridden and had no family, refused to eat and died a few months
later, in February.
</P>
<P>
   The contract restriction, known as a non-compete clause, was
required by the private mental health agency that initially
employed the counselor. When she switched agencies, she was forced
to stop seeing the elderly patient and others in that nursing home
_ even though officials there wanted to retain her services through
her new employer.
</P>
<P>
   Such restrictive covenants strike at the very heart of the
patient-provider relationship and the freedom of patients to follow
a trusted health care provider, say officials from organizations
representing health care professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Non-compete clauses were initially created by businesses to
protect trade secrets or a customer base. But they are increasingly
being used across the country by health care firms in an ever-more
competitive and profit-minded industry.
</P>
<P>
   If a car maker uses a non-compete clause to restrict employees,
``the cars don't suffer, nor do the customers who purchase the
cars,'' said Russ Newman, the executive director for professional
practice with the American Psychological Associaton.
</P>
<P>
   But in health care, he said, ``when you begin to prioritize
business interests over health care interests, who suffers is the
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The clauses typically stipulate that health care employees agree
not to take patients with them if they move to a different
employer, for a period of a year or two, even if the patients want
to maintain the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere, perhaps, is the patient-provider relationship more
important than between an elderly nursing home resident and her
mental health provider, say health care professionals.
</P>
<P>
   While some nursing homes have their own mental health staff or
allow private practitioners to come in and bill for their services,
many Massachusetts facilities contract with outside private
agencies to provide mental health services. These agencies, like
the one the Boston-area mental health counselor worked for, are
increasingly requiring non-compete clauses.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest maneuver in the field, for-profit Arbour
SeniorCare bought the competing MHM/Bay Colony agency in December.
The acquisition made it the largest such mental health agency in
New England, providing services to about 300 nursing homes. As part
of the deal, about 75 employees of MHM/Bay Colony were asked to
sign non-compete clauses with Arbour as a condition of continued
employment.
</P>
<P>
   But one Boston-area social worker refused to sign the
non-compete clause, which was a condition of continued employment.
She had just two days around Christmas to end relationships with 35
elderly and disabled patients at one long-term care facility, and
about a month to break off with another 65 patients at three
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these patients don't have families, or have families
who abandoned them long ago. It was really a horrible time of year
for this to have occurred,'' said the social worker, who also did
not want to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Arbour SeniorCare has sued psychologist Peter Janney for trying
to rescind a non-compete clause a few days after he signed it, but
the agency unsuccessfully tried to get a court injunction against
him, according to court documents. The firm also alleged Janney
tried to talk nursing homes he worked at out of signing contracts
with Arbour.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing home officials submitted documents in support of Janney,
saying they had no intention of signing with Arbour anyway,
according to court files. Janney has filed countercharges against
Arbour. The case is pending in Plymouth (Mass.) Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state attorney general has been asked to
investigate possible violations of anti-trust laws and patients'
rights by Arbour, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Hoch, chief executive officer of Arbour SeniorCare and a
certified clinical nurse specialist by training, declined to
comment on legal matters, but said that the agency was willing to
allow mental health workers to stay as long as needed to end
patient relationships gradually.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, owned by Universal Health Services in Pennsylvania,
is part of a Massachusetts system that includes Arbour Hospital, a
psychiatric facility in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ending relationships abruptly ``was not our policy and was not
our intent,'' said Hoch, who was surprised to hear about the
termination of 35 patients in two days at one facility. ``We gave
everyone the choice of how they wanted to make the transition or
termination with their patients. This is very upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   She defended the agency's use of non-compete clauses to protect
its patient base and business interests, while at the same time
saying that ``patient care is paramount. There is no question about
that.'' Hoch added, ``I like to think we balance it very well.''
</P>
<P>
   While such clauses have been a way of doing business in many
fields, Massachusetts last year prohibited TV and radio stations
from requiring non-compete clauses of employees, whether they be
news anchors, disc jockeys or technicians.
</P>
<P>
   And the state is one of the few, if not the only one, to
prohibit employers from requiring such clauses of physicians and
nurses, under laws that were put on the books more than 15 years
ago to protect patient choice, according to attorneys from the
Massachusetts Medical Society and the Boston law firm Stoneman,
Chandler &AMP; Miller, which represents health care employers.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no similar protection for psychologists, mental
health counselors and social workers, who have arguably one of the
most trusted relationships with patients.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris, psychologist and legal counsel for the
Massachusetts Psychological Association, who was not speaking on
behalf of the association, said he favors a state law extending the
protection to mental health workers, but there is currently no such
bill pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of agreements are not in the public interest,''
said Harris.

THE DAY OF THE DIGITAL ACTOR ISN'T FAR OFF 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   t sounds like a plot from a sci-fi pulp, or an old B movie: A
snaggle-toothed scientist toils in the laboratory, perfecting his
creation. A touch-up here, a tiny tuck there. But this is not some
green-gilled monster from the house of Dr. Frankenstein; it's a
realistic human with shiny hair, glittering teeth, and liquid eyes.
The pressure is on to beat other genetic geniuses racing to create
human clones. Suddenly, there's a burst of energy _ and voila! _
the model comes to life. Blink your eyes, and it's Marilyn Monroe.
Blink again, and it's James Dean.
</P>
<P>
   This scenario isn't as far-fetched _ or as far off _ as it might
once have seemed. In this case, the scientists in question are
digital doctors: computer programmers developing the software
needed to create a photorealistic digital actor, or
``synthespian.'' Special-effects wizards have already created
convincing digital dinosaurs and dolls, aliens and ants, stuntmen
and superheroes. And the two biggest box office draws of the moment
_ ``The Mummy'' and a certain prequel that unfolds in a galaxy far,
far away _ showcase digital creatures.
</P>
<P>
   So why not digital humans? Why not virtual stars?
</P>
<P>
   ``The digital actor has been the Holy Grail forever, since the
dawn of 3-D computer animation,'' says Brad Lewis, executive
producer of visual effects and vice president of Pacific Data
Images, the firm that gave life to insects in ``Antz.'' ``There's
always been someone trying to do a hand or a face or some aspect of
a human being that looked real.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say realistic digital humans will be on-screen within the
next five years. These synthespians could be brand-new characters
or reincarnations of old legends, long cold in the grave. One
Hollywood producer, for instance, is planning a film that would
resurrect martial-arts phenomenon Bruce Lee; another is reportedly
working on a digital version of an aging screen star (rumored to be
Marlon Brando), restoring his youth and making him a contender for
a manly role. Another producer got permission to re-create the late
George Burns in a film called ``The Best Man,'' and a California
firm, Virtual Celebrity Productions, has obtained the rights to
digitally reproduce a handful of stars, including Marlene Dietrich
and W. C. Fields.
</P>
<P>
   But some veterans of computer animation are wondering whether
the quest is worth it. ``I think it's a scientific goal, but I'm
not sure it's an artistic goal,'' says Lewis. ``Because it's the
Holy Grail, though, there is a movement to achieve it. But once the
technology progresses, the industry will come back to the question
of `Why?' '' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Day of the flying logos &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back in the late '70s, the pioneers in computer animation
weren't asking ``Why?'' They were asking ``How?'' There was no
shrink-wrapped software for special effects; they invented it as
they went along. Ellen Poon, visual effects supervisor for George
Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic and senior technical director
for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' got her start in
advertising 20 years ago. ``We were doing flying logos,'' she says.
``The computer power wasn't good enough to do anything more
complicated than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology's leap forward was visible in 1982 with ``Tron,''
the first film to incorporate computer graphics. At the time, the
graphics were revolutionary: The plot, however, was revolting. ``We
all thought `Tron' would open the floodgates for computer animation
in feature films,'' recalls ``Tron'' animator Jeff Kleiser,
co-director of the North Adams-based computer animation firm
Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co. ``It didn't do well at the box
office, so they said, `Oh, computer graphics doesn't work.' `Tron'
set back computer graphics a good decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology doesn't drive Hollywood: Money does. So despite other
breakthroughs in technology over the years, the real push for
digital animation didn't occur until the computer-generated ``Toy
Story'' raked in millions at the box office in 1995 _ and made a
small fortune with its line of dolls and accessories. Shortly after
the release, Pixar Animation Studios, which made the film for
Disney, went public; the stock soared, leaving founder Steve Jobs
with more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, the race to create digital humans intensified.
</P>
<P>
   By now, computer-generated creatures _ once the domain of
special-effects masters who built miniatures and puppets and
prosthetics _ are fairly routine. They fill in regularly for extras
and stuntmen, and usually the audience doesn't even notice (see
accompanying story).
</P>
<P>
   But it's one thing to create crowd scenes that flash across the
scene for a second; it's another thing entirely to emulate hair,
skin, and facial expressions for major characters. The giant ape in
last year's ``Mighty Joe Young'' solved the hair problem, making
King Kong look like a big guy on his way to a costume party. And
``Antz'' starred creatures that communicated complex emotions, even
if they were just a bunch of pests.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one has found a way to capture a human soul with a
mathematical formula. And many of the folks who write the code
insist that actors are never going to be made obsolete. ``A human
being brings something to the screen that is a function of their
working mind,'' says John Andrew Berton Jr., Industrial Light and
Magic's visual effects supervisor for ``The Mummy.'' ``There is
inspiration there; it happens on the fly. You can't simulate that
stuff. It's not a mathematical model. You can't confuse the
computers with the artists. They're just a tool.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The downside of FX &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Berton and others often cite George Lucas, the industry guru who
insists that ``Star Wars'' is primarily about the story, not the
special effects or the toy collectibles or the pizza boxes. ``We
have to make sure that what we're doing serves the story, not the
interest of advancing the art of making digital characters,''
Berton says.
</P>
<P>
   But that is precisely what has fueled criticism of both ``The
Mummy'' and ``Phantom Menace.'' In both cases, the computer steals
the show, chewing up the very scenery it helped create. Is the
quest for the perfect digital actor really worth it if the price is
a loss of humanity?
</P>
<P>
   That's a question the Screen Actors Guild is mulling as it
watches the technology evolve. Guild president Richard Masur scoffs
at the idea that synthespians will ever replace the real thing.
``Actors are not inert objects to be manipulated by directors or
technicians or even puppeteers,'' he says. ``When you talk about
replacing them, you assume that they have no creative input, no
character choice. You're cutting out one of the major contributors
to the finished work when you cut an actor out of the process.''

 UNDATED: ... the process.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And face it, movies have always been about illusion. ``Look,
reality has been messed with since the beginning of movies,'' says
Masur. ``In the original silent `Ben Hur,' they did the chariot
scene with one row of living people in the arena. The rest were
wooden cutouts moving on sticks, but it looked like hundreds of
people. In `Titanic,' there were a lot of virtual people sliding
into the water. They used to do it by throwing dummies. The only
change is that the technology is more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely.
</P>
<P>
   But how far will that technology go? Experimentation is taking
place in both popular culture and the fine arts. The video-game
industry is attempting to develop interactive characters with some
degree of artificial intelligence. Theme park attractions with 3-D
superheroes are wildly popular; Kleiser's firm just completed a
ride called ``The Amazing Adventures of Spiderman'' for the new
Universal Studios park in Orlando, Fla. At the same time, he also
worked on ``Monsters of Grace,'' the Philip Glass-Robert Wilson
opera that is told through a three-dimensional film featuring a
digital family. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dead celebrities society &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Virtual Celebrity Productions, the California
company that is aiming to simulate dead celebrities for commercial
use. Its version of W. C. Fields looks like a stuffed mannequin
with a puffy nose, but company founder Jeff Lotman, a former
food-company executive, contends that the technology is getting
better. ``When I saw Tom Hanks shake hands with John Kennedy in
`Forrest Gump,' I thought, `Wow, that's great.' Someone is going to
create a photorealistic actor who can do whatever you want, and I
wanted to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects in ``Gump'' were created by slicing old footage
together, similar to techniques used for commercials that had Fred
Astaire dancing with an electric broom and John Wayne shilling
beer. Digital technology, however, won't be limited to existing
footage. Lotman has already obtained the rights to reproduce such
celebrities as Vincent Price, James Cagney, Groucho Marx, Gracie
Allen, George Burns, and Sammy Davis Jr. But don't expect to see
James Dean resurrected to star in a fourth feature film: His estate
turned down Lotman's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Masur of the Screen Actors Guild says he doesn't have any
problem with Lotman's venture, since he is obtaining the legal
rights from the estates. ``I can't think of a single celebrity
whose image has been used with permission who would have the
slightest qualm about the fact that their image was benefiting
their heirs,'' Masur says. ``It's only immoral if it's stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   But like the scientists whose discoveries wreak havoc in horror
films, some digital pioneers are appalled by the application.
``It's another indication of how careful we have to be as human
beings not to damn our own futures,'' warns Lewis of Pacific Data
Images. ``I hope to God when I'm dead nobody tries to create a
digital version of me. Now we're going to have to put in our wills,
`I cannot be digitally re-created in any form.' We're just going to
make the lawyers rich again.''
</P>
<P>
   Such tinkering is making digital animators question their craft
_ even as they race to perfect the technology to make it possible.
``The idea of dredging profits from the grave is unethical and
immoral,'' says Kleiser. ``It becomes spooky. We don't want to
besmirch the careers of actors from the past, even if the
descendants of that actor make money by selling off Grandpop's
image. Computer programmers shouldn't be allowed to interfere with
their body of work.''
</P>
<P>
   But a film starring a digital Marilyn Monroe or a virtual George
Burns will probably be nothing more than a novelty. And no one is
predicting that acting coaches will have to retire or that stuntmen
will have to pursue careers in the World Wrestling Federation.
Until a computer figures out how to exude charisma, actors will get
work. ``I don't think if anyone had the choice between Harrison
Ford and a digital actor that they'd opt to create it themselves _
unless they wanted his nostrils pulled over his eyelids,'' Lewis
says.
</P>
<P>
   But back in the computer laboratories, some technical wizards
are wondering just what it is they are creating. The real test of a
digital actor will come when it can realistically perform a
monologue in close-up. ``We can do skin texture; we can pretty much
do hair,'' Kleiser says. ``We're better at the subtlety of motion
of a human face. But I'm talking about a close-up, someone's face
talking that looks realistic. I don't think we're there yet, and
I'm not even sure it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the questions emerge, Universal Pictures is working on a
hush-hush project that reportedly will break major ground on
creating a photorealistic digital actor. The film isn't due out for
two or three years; some industry sources think it's about to be
canceled. Form will reflect content in this tale: It's a digital
remake of a film called ``Frankenstein.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (sidebar) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; MOTIVATING A MUMMY &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Mummy,'' South African actor Arnold Vosloo shares the
title role with a computer-generated spectral creature. In some
scenes, he's half-human and half-mummy, with part of his face
superimposed with petrified goo. It took several days to shoot one
scene in which a bug crawls out of his neck and into his mouth;
Vosloo performed the scene wearing tracking markers on the place
where the bug would be superimposed by the computer during
post-production.
</P>
<P>
   By now, most actors are used to performing against a ``blue
screen,'' the blank background that is later filled in with digital
scenery and effects. But three days to munch an imaginary beetle?
</P>
<P>
   ``By the third day, it was hard to be enthused about chewing a
bug,'' says Vosloo, who trained in the theater in South Africa.
``But in a way, it goes back to the classical stuff. Whether you're
playing Hamlet or whatever, you often find yourself standing alone
on a stage and talking about the mountains or the birds and the
bees. It's the same thing. It's just visualization.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer-generated mummy was animated by the process of
motion capture, in which a live actor or dancer performs movements
that are turned into three-dimensional computer data, a sort of
digital skeleton for the character. Often, a double does this work,
but Vosloo did it himself. ``It was me and the computer geeks for
two weeks,'' he says. After he learned the language _ ``It was like
being with a group of mechanical engineers talking about combustion
engines'' _ he let himself go. ``The best lesson is how free you
can be once certain restrictions are put on you,'' he says. ``I
thought I would have to act by numbers, but it was actually pretty
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other actors in the adventure film failed to see the
Shakespearean significance of the process. ``They didn't have a
good time,'' Vosloo says. ``It's easy to get tired, and when you're
so busy trying to hit computer marks, you can forget about the
performance.'' The other actors had to imagine they were running
from a spectral mummy or react in horror as they were devoured by
invisible creepy crawlers.
</P>
<P>
   The actors in ``Star Wars: Episide I _ The Phantom Menace''
worked the same way; some 1,965 of the film's 2,200 shots are
jazzed up with computer-generated imagery. Liam Neeson, for one,
didn't find the experience freeing. ``I'm retiring from movies next
year,'' he told Redbook magazine. ``Honest to God, I don't want to
do it anymore. I'm not happy doing it. Film is a director's medium;
it has nothing to do with actors. We are basically puppets, walking
around, hitting marks, saying lines.'' Later, he said he was only
kidding. Go figure.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ From across the room, he saw her, a young woman wearing
the flowing garb of her Muslim culture.
</P>
<P>
   And, from what Khaled Rawashdeh was told about the young woman
that day two years ago at a religious social, she was everything he
was looking for in a mate: Lebanese, a faithful Muslim, and a
member of a well-respected family in Boston. Yet he never said a
word to the 18-year-old. Instead, he walked into her father's
office days later and asked for her hand in marriage.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation that reached back to the young man's
family in Jordan, Mona Eid and her father agreed to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Mona and Khaled's journey to the altar is similar
to that of a growing number of young immigrants across the state
who, aware of this country's high divorce rate and struggling to
hold onto their cultural roots, are turning to a variation of a
centuries-old custom carried over from their homelands _ arranged
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our culture, love comes after marriage,'' said Mona
Rawashdeh, 20.
</P>
<P>
   While there is little statistical evidence on the prevalence of
marrying for economic, cultural, and religious reasons rather than
for love, members of the international community in Massachusetts
are increasingly turning to their parents to choose a mate, say
cultural leaders from the Asian, Indian, and Arab communities.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of these singles, aware of the evolving world in
which their children live, are beginning to use the Internet and
classified ads to help them with their matchmaking endeavors. In
July, Indian parents across the country will bring their children
between the ages of 21 and 35 to a matrimonial conference in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage is a mutual agreement between the family and the
woman,'' said Imam Talal Eid, Mona's father. ``If she says yes,
then we have to say yes. If one of us says no, then the deal is
off.''
</P>
<P>
   While such marriages rarely end in divorce, unlike nearly half
of American marriages, the idea of arranging to marry someone you
do not know goes against this country's tradition of what US
sociologists have dubbed ``love marriages.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with so-called love marriages, said Jamal Malek, a
member of the Islamic Center of Boston, is that relationships
between both sides of the family and economic and religious
differences are not taken into consideration until it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, sex and romance have been so much a part of the
American prenuptial relationship that romance soon withers, whereas
love is just beginning to blossom after couples like Mona and
Khaled are married, said Malek.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, the reason why they last,'' said Mona Rawashdeh, ``is in
my religion, marriage is something that is for your whole life. So
when you have that mentality that it's forever, whatever happens
you try to work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   But that success rate should be viewed only through cultural
prisms, according to Omar Khalidi, a professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Asian and Muslim cultures stay in bad marriages
because divorces, although allowed, are discouraged, said Khalidi.
``The individuals may not be happy, but they are not breaking up
because of societal pressures,'' he said. ``But, by American
standards, that's a lousy marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the days of old, when children were forced to marry their
parents' choice of mate, today the young are involved in the
process, and can choose not to marry at all.
</P>
<P>
   Quoc Huynh, 20, decided not to follow in his older brother's
footsteps. Last summer, his brother reluctantly traveled to their
native Vietnam to marry a bride of the family's choosing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm just too young to even think about it,'' said Huynh,
who plans to complete his studies at the University of
Massachusetts and seek a job rather than a wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many young people who say, `No `I don't want to
follow your system,' '' said Malek. ``So basically, we as parents
have learned you can only go to a certain extent with your
children. As they say, `You can drive a horse to water but you
can't make him drink.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While the Immigration and Naturalization Service saw a 40
percent increase between 1995 and 1996 in the number of green-card
holders requesting to bring their spouse to this country, laws are
tightening to secure against marriage fraud and abuse against
women.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago in Lincoln, Neb., a 39-year-old Iraqi arranged
the marriage of his two daughters, 18 and 14, to two Iraqis, ages
28 and 34, who had fled the Gulf War. The Islamic tradition ran
against the Nebraska law, so the girls were protected when they
fled; they were eventually placed in foster care. The adults were
charged with child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   While such incidents do happen, said Malek, most parents are
careful to make sure their child is marrying someone well adjusted,
economically sound, and from the same social class.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jayavendra, 29, will travel to his native India this
summer to marry someone not only of his culture but of the same
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dated women, but it was just important that when I got
married that I marry in the same caste system,'' said Jayavendra, a
member of the Brahmin caste, the highest in India's social class.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is nearing 30, Jayavendra decided, like his brothers
and sisters before him, to allow his parents to choose his
prospects. His parents made calls to families, visited homes, and
investigated eligible women. Then, they sent their son pictures of
India's loveliest and smartest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually kind of fun,'' said Jayavendra.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Khaled Rawashdeh, 27, was also planning to travel
to his native Jordan so his parents could help him find a bride.
But when friends told him about Mona, he decided he might not
travel to Jordan after all.
</P>
<P>
   He called her father's office and arrived with two other people
to introduce himself to the clergyman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I am looking to get married and I think your daughter
is what I am looking for. What do you think?' '' remembered
Rawashdeh.
</P>
<P>
   But Imam Talal Eid, who runs the Islamic Center of Boston, was
not in any mood to discuss a marriage proposal. ``I really wanted
Mona to finish the first year in college,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Eid himself had sought the help of his mother in finding a
wife 22 years ago when he was a young, busy clergyman in Lebanon.
The fruit of his mother's labor has lasted 20 years and produced
six children.
</P>
<P>
   Mona, his oldest daughter, and her suitor would sit in their
Quincy home on Sunday evenings like he and his wife did years
before, discussing their dreams and interests. Known as the
engagement period, it is when couples, who can call the wedding off
at any time, get to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I found what I wanted and nothing about her could turn
me off,'' said Khaled Rawashdeh. ``I couldn't ask for better.''

IN THE CENTER OF THE SCHOOL   FINANCE DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CONCORD, N.H. -- &UR;  &LR; Give New Hampshire a little time, and you
start thinking about Israel or Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The factions, feuding, fulminations, and fighting over public
school finances have been going on so long that the prospect of a
settlement can seem more jarring to the politicians than more of
the debilitating same.
</P>
<P>
   In an atmosphere dominated by the poles of opinion the wishes of
ordinary people clearly reflected in the polls of opinion are easy
to forget. From each pole comes the same message: wrecking a
settlement is justified because, after all, we're right.
</P>
<P>
   One month, a more or less bipartisan majority of the Legislature
is cobbled together to enact a hodge-podge of revenue measures
built around a statewide property tax in response to a state
supreme court ruling almost two years ago that the public school
financing system is illegal. Now the Legislature is now mired in
its budget process that has to produce the final chunk of money for
the new system so that it can pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   You can smell what's ahead _ delay, inaction, stalemate,
building toward legislature-manufactured crisis as the next fiscal
year looms in July. Then come continuing resolutions, fiscal chaos,
injury to the ordinary operation of government, recourse to the
courts, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The simple solution _ just finish the stupid job _ has yet to
occur to the feuding factions. Each is convinced that its way,
backed by a constituency that confuses decibel level with support,
must be the only way.
</P>
<P>
   With an $825 million package already in hand, the Legislature
first must enact an agreed-upon (in principle) 25-cent increase in
the cigarette tax. Then it must fill a fiscal hole left between the
package enacted this spring and what is required to complete the
reform (you get an argument over how large it is).
</P>
<P>
   The current inaction stems from an ideologically driven effort
in the Republican-led House to find the money exclusively with deep
cuts in the rest of state government; in the newly Democratic
Senate, the root of the problem is the still-driving dream of the
state's progressives to have a state income tax.
</P>
<P>
   In the eye of the impending storm sits the state's remarkable
governor, Jeanne Shaheen _ fiscally conservative, otherwise mostly
progressive but also committed to the Third Way of thinking that
you find in such places as California or Britain. She also has been
elected in two landslides on a vow not to approve a state income or
sales tax, which she has had the temerity to stick to as she drove
the process of responding to the court decision.
</P>
<P>
   In conversation in her office, she is content to lay back and
allow the Legislature to confront its duty to go the last mile
responsibly, quietly confident that in the end it will do so if the
alternative is more chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she is also freshly armed with perspective from
attending the Education Commission of the States in Kentucky, one
of many states that has successfully gone through a court-ordered
reform of public school financing.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Shaheen has opened her mouth during this crisis, she
has reached the solid majority of citizens who both like her and
approve of her approach.
</P>
<P>
   One of the facts often forgotten in the midst of the yelling
matches is that New Hampshire doesn't have bad public schools; in
fact, it has pretty good public schools. And, as conservatives have
taught, education excellence is not a function of some magical,
per-pupil spending number.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the state's package _ if the last holes are filled _
comes in above some other states' responses in similar situations
that had no difficulty passing court review of what is termed
``adequacy.'' New Hampshire, under Shaheen, is also moving well
within the mainstream of the national movement to use performance
and accountability standards to spur further reform.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a court challenge to New Hampshire's looming
solution is inevitable. It's one thing if it comes only from the
minority of so-called property-rich towns where taxes would rise
under a statewide system.
</P>
<P>
   But it's something else if it comes as well from the towns that
brought the state lawsuit in the first place and decide that going
for even more money is better than helping make the reform work.
</P>
<P>
   Legal or legislative, and don't forget the added poison from a
name-calling commentariat up here, the misimpression is of total
polarization.
</P>
<P>
   But that misses the dynamism of the center. It is not
difference-splitting, but problem-solving: more resources for most
schools in need against a background of substantial property tax
reform.
</P>
<P>
   The right and left poles, opposing a state solution on the one
hand and advocating an income tax on the other, share the need to
block a legislative solution by any means to advance their cause.
By definition that makes the schools a pretext.
</P>
<P>
   But for the governor, the schools are the cause. This is one
case where the polls are more reliable.

THANK FRED HARVEY FOR TOURIST RESTAURANTS AND SOUVENIR SHOPS
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of tourists on train buying souvenirs

<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone has had the experience. Sitting in a car, humming along
a smooth highway on a long trip. Bored beyond conversation, looking
out the window at the same landscape hour after hour. The only
thought is, ''When are we going to stop and eat?''
</P>
<P>
   We haven't much choice in where we eat anymore with chain
restaurants to be found even in the smallest towns in America. It
is a sad comment on the state of our available options that there
are books published about the location of ``real'' road food.
</P>
<P>
   But if we bemoan the lack of choice today, imagine for a moment
the state of travel out west about a hundred years ago where the
alternatives were few and miserable. The lucky traveler of that day
with a railway ticket faced hours of monotony staring out at the
bleak landscape. The journey was broken by two things at its end _
the long awaited meal and perhaps the sight of Native Americans
selling trinkets at the station.
</P>
<P>
   These two distractions from the tedious trip were to provide
fame and fortune to Fred Harvey, the father of the modern chain
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The Fred Harvey restaurants were part of a brilliant marketing
plan. The target: the typical traveler on the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railroad who sat for hours or days on horsehair-stuffed
leather banquettes, dreaming of a decent meal when the jostling of
the train stopped.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, however, that meal was a disaster. When the train
stopped for fuel and water, passengers scrambled into the local
eatery, ordered food and hoped it arrived quickly enough to be
gobbled down before the train pulled out of the station. The usual
fare _ a stringy piece of meat, some eggs and a cup of coffee _ was
served by proprietors ill-equipped to handle the sudden and
overwhelming throngs of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Harvey hit upon the idea of a restaurant chain as a result
of his own miserable experience riding the rails. Born in England
in 1835, Harvey emigrated to the United States at the age of 15 and
worked his way up in the restaurant business until a partner
absconded with the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Thrust by necessity into a new career as a freight and cattle
agent, Harvey looked out onto the western horizon and saw his
future. He believed that a fine eating establishment with
reasonable prices would be a success.
</P>
<P>
   How right he was.
</P>
<P>
   In 1876, he opened the first Harvey House in Topeka, Kan. The
Santa Fe Railroad supplied coal, ice and water, transportation for
furnishings, food, supplies and personnel all without charge to
Harvey in exchange for a reliable meal. And this Harvey delivered.
His standard breakfast consisted of cereal or fruit, steak and
eggs, hash browns, six hotcakes, apple pie and coffee. All for 50
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's second great idea was to recruit women to serve the
food. Waitresses added another layer of refinement to his
operations and diminished lingering fears of travel in the Wild
West. Newspapers throughout the East and Midwest ran the following
advertisement:
</P>
<P>
   ''Wanted - Young women, 18 to 30 years of age, of good
character, attractive and intelligent, as waitresses in Harvey
Eating Houses on the Santa Fe Railroad in the West. Good wages,
with room and meals furnished. Experience not necessary. Write Fred
Harvey, Union Depot, Kansas City, Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   Clad in black dresses with crisp white aprons, hair pulled back
demurely, the Harvey Girls, as they came to be known, were models
of efficiency and cheerfulness and reassured customers in
unfamiliar territory. The Harvey Girls had the privilege in working
in fairly elegant surroundings with Irish linen on the tables,
china, and Sheffield silver.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Harvey graduated from lunchroom to restaurant and finally
to hotels. The Santa Fe Railroad latched onto the glamour and
mystique of the Southwest by naming their trains the ''Chief'' and
''Superchief'' and using the thunderbird motif on their tableware.
Harvey named his hotels the Casta$eda, El Navaho, La Fonda,
Alvarado, Fray Marcos, La Posada, The Montezuma, The Havasu and
Sequoyah.
</P>
<P>
   Furnished in the what the company advertised as ''Indian
Style,'' they were an understated and modern presentation of Native
American and Hispanic influences _ not today's turquoise howling
coyote.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's success was phenomenal and for the final coup, he
created a thriving souvenir trade. Travelers were besieged at the
railroad station by Native Americans selling pottery, blankets or
jewelry and it wasn't too long before the artisans became savvy _
utilitarian water jugs became smaller and rugs took on the popular
decorating hues of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvey Company, anxious to cash in on the booming souvenir
market, regularly wrote to Lorenzo Hubbell, owner of a famed
trading post on the Navajo reservation, and specified which colors
and motifs of rugs would sell best.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvey Company credited itself with reviving Navajo weaving
as well as rekindling an interest in the nearly extinct craft of
basket weaving. They trumpeted, ''Fred Harvey has done more for all
the Indian tribes in the Southwest than the thousands of people who
have written books, people in Congress, humanitarian committees,
etc. because we have created a market for their goods....'' The
Harvey Company didn't make out so badly in the deal, either.
</P>
<P>
   The souvenir trade begat the sacred American tradition of the
gift shop thereby linking the Harvey markets together. A train
passenger alighting in Albuquerque, N. M., for instance, was
quickly surrounded by Native Americans showing off their goods. The
colonnaded arcade of the Alvarado housed the Indian Building, with
its museum and a demonstration room where artisans created items
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   One had to pass through the salesrooms on the way back out to
the train or in again for dinner. With limited entertainment
available, is it any wonder that the tourist wandered back into the
gift shop and bought and bought?
</P>
<P>
   The tradition lives on. We travel more than any generation
before us. And spend more, too. And whether we go by car, train or
plane, we can be sure that at the beginning, the end or anywhere
along the route there will be a chain restaurant and a gift shop
nearby. Thank you, Fred Harvey.

<P>
   &UR; 111 &LR;  ``Dancemaker'' Matthew Diamond takes his look at Paul
Taylor a step beyond most dance documentaries. He charts
dancer-choreographer Taylor's evolution and endurance, but devotes
just as much screen time to the anxieties of the hard-working and
devoted dancers whose bodies are Taylor's tools, and whom he isn't
above manipulating to arrive at his elegant, athletic dances with
their frequent emphasis on solitariness. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   (FU)  &UR; 11 &LR;  1/2 ``Endurance'' The quiet, self-contained dignity of
Haile Gebrselassie, the Ethiopian gold medalist in the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics' 10,000-meter run, translates into a compelling screen
presence in this docudrama in which he plays himself. But you can't
help feeling there's more complexity to him and his story than this
simple straight-line narrative is equipped to convey. (G)
</P>
<P>
   (FU)  &UR; 111 &LR;  ``Get Real'' Smart, realistic portrayal of a gay
16-year-old who falls in love with the school hunk. The film feels
familiar without being hackneyed, and in this movie year packed
with adolescent angst, ``Get Real'' easily emerges as the best of
the bunch. (R) (Renee Graham)

   &UR; 111 &LR;  ``The Love Letter'' A charming screenful of amiable
mischief set in a New England seacoast town (played by Rockport).
Everybody knows everybody else's business, or thinks they're
entitled to, especially when one after another finds an unsigned
love letter each is convinced is addressed to her or him. Kate
Capshaw's frazzled bookshop owner is warm and simpatico, and the
others are engaging, too, especially Tom Selleck as Capshaw's
feelingful but inarticulate old flame and Julianne Nicholson as her
spunky young summertime clerk. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 111 &LR;  ``A Place Called Chiapas'' Although there is little doubt
about where her allegiances lie, filmmaker Nettie Wild presents a
fascinating, even-handed examination of the bloody acrimony between
Mexico's government and Mayan Indians waging a guerrilla war for
improved education, health care, and rule over their ancestral
lands. (Unrated) (Renee Graham)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 11 &LR;  1/2 ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' A world
apart from ``Star Wars'' _ and a notch below. It'll satisfy the
fans, but only just, and mostly because of snazzy visuals. The film
is unmistakably aimed at the young. Character and personality take
a back seat as this story focuses on Liam Neeson's Jedi Knight; his
pupil, Ewan McGregor's young Obi-Wan Kenobi; and his even younger
discovery, Jake Lloyd's Anakin Skywalker, the Tom Sawyer kid who
grows up to become Darth Vader but who at this point is more
interested in hot-rodding. (PG)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 111 &LR;  ``Trekkies'' Making fun of ``Trekkies,'' those folks
obsessed with all things ``Star Trek,'' has always been rather like
shooting fish in a barrel _ it's just too easy. So it says a lot
about Roger Nygard's often-hilarious documentary on the Trekkie
phenomenon that he spends as much time laughing with devotees as he
does laughing at them. (PG) (Renee Graham)

BACK HOME IN KENTUCKY

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
CLEAR SPRINGS 
A Memoir 
By Bobbie Ann Mason. Random House. 298 pp. Illustrated. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With her Kentucky pedigree and plain-spoken ambiguities, Bobbie
Ann Mason was one of the American writers who emerged in the 1980s
under the unruly rubric of minimalism, though she didn't really
belong there. Like other contemporaries trying to capture the
cloverleaf cruelties of the New South, she wrote about K Mart
stores and scattered families and empty rooms with Jerry Falwell
preaching from the TV _ but these were outcomes of history, not
personal failures, and her fiction contained too much heartsore
loss to qualify for the bleakness of minimalism. Throughout her
stories and novels ran a theme of disconnection and returning _ of
leaving home only to grieve for it, of feeling the earth under your
feet even when the world seemed capable of ejecting you from its
orbit. It may have already disappeared under the rubble of history,
but there was still that sense or promise of the land: a place that
either held you in memory or that you couldn't go on without.
</P>
<P>
   This palpable absence is revealed and explained in ``Clear
Springs,'' which is Mason's first effort at autobiography _ a
painstaking exploration of her Kentucky family and the farm they
owned, and of the paths leading outward from that lodestone that
would bend the author's course. At the center of the story is
Mason's mother, Christy Mason, who dreamed of going north to
Detroit, but instead stayed home, raised four children, and helped
her husband run their dairy farm on the outskirts of the little
town of Mayfield in western Kentucky. A few years ago, widowed and
in her 70s, she gave in to her children's requests and moved into
town. Most days, she still drives out to the farm to go fishing at
the pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clear Springs'' is a tender but uneven story about memory and
family and the costs of progress; it is also Mason's attempt to
capture her own equivocal legacy as both a loyalist and a wanderer.
In this regard, the work follows a classical arc, one that's become
familiar in the current memoir: early innocence and fidelity, the
far-flung, roaming bluster of youth, the redemptive reckoning of
the return. These constructs shape the chronology of the narrative.
Spanning Mason's first few decades, from her birth in 1940 through
graduate school and marriage in 1969, ``Clear Springs'' then skips
to 1990, when Mason returned to Kentucky with her husband to buy
their own piece of land. Woven throughout are the stories of her
predecessors: the brief, ill-fated marriage of her mother's
parents; the Mason family who, related by marriage, took in Christy
as a child, then watched her fall in love with a distant cousin;
the ceaseless, rewarding partnership of Christy and Wilburn Mason,
who between them worked hard enough to feed a family of six from
the garden and livestock they raised.
</P>
<P>
   That's a bone-deep American tale, and you can feel the emergence
of a young literary imagination, counting bugs and reading Nancy
Drew novels there in the pastoral stasis of Kentucky. When Mason
was 10 or 11, she started writing her own mystery stories, where
``the pleasure of writing was discovering what might pop out of my
mind unbidden.'' As she would come to realize, this free-fall
consciousness was one of the necessities of a fictional
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   The laws of class are different in the rural South: Mason's
family wasn't poor, but every dollar counted, and they didn't have
indoor plumbing until after the Second World War. The days were
about plowing and weeding and hog butchering and selling
blackberries for a dollar a gallon; the dinners in between,
courtesy of Christy Mason, were about chicken and ham and biscuits
and tomatoes and damson pie. It's a romantic life in print and an
exhausting, insular one in reality, and Bobbie Ann did what
millions have done before her: She left the farm and headed for the
bright lights. Entranced by the wildfire promises of rock 'n' roll
and literature, she hit New York in 1962 _ whereupon she traded in
her sundresses and high heels for an earnestly sophisticated
mantle. It seems to have taken, but it didn't fool Mason herself,
who longed for the South and suffered a culture shock that any
immigrant to the Northeast will find poignantly familiar. Graduate
school didn't help. She went to Binghamton, N.Y., to study English
Lit, and found a well-meaning professor who encouraged her to read
the Greeks. ``I read Plato's Republic to my wife on our
honeymoon,'' he told Mason, who was flabbergasted at the idea. ``I
had the wrong gear for this venture,'' she remembers thinking. ``I
was like one of those catfish that can sort of walk on land _
awkwardly, using their whiskers like elbows.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the Beatles and Vietnam, the rest of America was
enduring a greater systemic shock, and those forces, too, would
influence Mason in ways she couldn't have known at the time _ in
the cultural lightning-bolt references of her fiction, in her
wonderful Vietnam novel, ``In Country.'' But almost none of her
life as a writer is included in ``Clear Springs,'' whether for
reasons of modesty or focus. Instead Mason has chosen to remember
the formative, smaller world that made her who she was, even though
she would have to leave there to recognize its dominion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clear Springs'' has odd failings, and the story is so full of
honorable intention that those shortcomings feel distressing. But
Mason was hardly the ruthless self-editor in this book. Devoted to
her family, intent upon capturing the force and beauty of life in
rural Kentucky and its changing face over the decades, she is
indiscriminate in what she has chosen to include _ with very little
of the synthesis or retrospective analysis that makes for brilliant
memoir. Mason has always been an unabashedly straightforward
writer, and that has worked to great advantage in works such as
``Shiloh and Other Stories'' and ``In Country,'' both of which paid
scrupulous attention to form. When it comes to the story of her
family, though, she has been less unsentimental; as with her
mother's cluttered farmhouse on moving day, Mason simply didn't
know what to throw out.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for dull reading sometimes, either uncensored (must
we know the cartoons the Mason kids watched, or the color and
texture of Mason's childhood phlegm?) or unprocessed (can't she
comment on her grandfather's hitting her, or the animal fatalities
that broke her heart?). And such irritations deflect from the very
real power of what is best about ``Clear Springs.'' That
distinction encircles Christy Mason, who is clearly the heroine of
her daughter's story; by the end of the book, it's easy to see why.
The last chapter of ``Clear Springs'' contains a stunning narrative
about a day in the life of Christy Mason that elicits the finest
stuff imaginable from two different women: the older one passionate
and cussedly stubborn, the younger one _ the writer-witness _
resolute and beautifully loyal. One carries a fishing rod and the
other a No. 2 pencil; in the hands of the Mason women, those are
both formidable tools.

THOREAU'S COUNTRY 
Journey Through a Transformed Landscape 
By David R. Foster. Harvard University Press. 270 pp. Illustrated.
$27.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry David Thoreau, determinedly individualistic, has suffered
an interesting fate in the tag end of the 20th century. He is
become Everyman. Henry is our aphoristic Poor Richard (``Simplify,
simplify, simplify.'') and our epigraphic picture-calendar-selling
Noble Savage (``In wilderness is the salvation of the world.'') and
he is our original Libertarian (``that government is best which
governs least''). He mined his astonishing journals for ``Walden,
or, Life in the Woods'' and ``A Week on the Concord and Merrimack
Rivers.'' Posthumously, friends published additional refined ore
from those daybooks: ``Cape Cod'' and ``The Maine Woods.'' That is
hardly the end of the list _ he was, as they used to type, the
author of all the above ``&AMP;c., &AMP;c.''
</P>
<P>
   David R. Foster, the director of the Harvard Forest at Harvard
University (located in Petersham, Mass.), has painstakingly sifted
through the journals for Thoreau's insights into the effect of
human occupation on the forest primeval. Foster, who teaches
ecology at Harvard, is uniquely situated for this work: The Harvard
Forest's mission is investigating how land use, fire, and
hurricanes shape our woodlands, and to Foster, Thoreau is the
granddaddy of all scientific foresters.
</P>
<P>
   Foster is correct in his judgment to this extent: Thoreau's
particular talent as a naturalist was an uncanny eye for the
visible traces of human activity that shaped his landscape as he
sauntered near Walden Pond. And in spite of his reputation as a
loner (he did write that he was his own best company), Thoreau was
haunted by the human history of his countryside. Those two
interests came together, as readers of the journal know, in his
uncanny ability to find arrowheads, pottery shards, and stone tools
scattered by the long-departed Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In Foster's selections from the journals, Thoreau's perceptive
eye is focused on the succession of forest trees, the dispersal of
seeds, the management of woodlots, and the remnants of old,
aboriginal, forest. Another reader of the journals will find
everything from anti-Irish sentiment to anti-slavery fervor. At
roughly the length of the Bible (and still in print after all these
years), Thoreau's journals are open to literal interpretation,
Talmudic argument, and literary criticism. Although highly
selected, the fragments of the journals reprinted in ``Thoreau's
Country'' are a fair, if minute, sampling of the riches of the
original. Sampling is not a bad introduction: One needs only a
teaspoon of soup to see how the whole stock-pot tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Foster organized his book in a nonacademic manner: A series of
quotations from the journal will precede, and then surround, a
reflective essay that is deceptively straightforward. There are any
number of moments when Foster explains something that seems obvious
enough, but which the reader (at least this reader) could not have
noticed without Foster's help. Take a simple example: Thoreau's use
of the word ``meadow.'' He restricts it to flat, seasonally
flooded, riverside land that is regularly mown for the wild hay it
produces. There are no meadows along the Concord and Sudbury rivers
today. The eponymous meadows of Great Meadows National Wildlife
Refuge in Concord are nothing but a stew-pond of lilies, cattails,
muskrats, and catfish. Gone are a the nesting bobolinks, as
departed as the rustic Concordians wielding scythes.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving open space, in community zoning, has come to mean
preserving anything _ bramble patches, alder thickets, oak
stumplands. What we keep literally open, in the towns about Walden
Pond, we keep open through agriculture or the indiscriminate mowing
that at least keeps the white pines and birches from filling in yet
another abandoned field. But the mere thought of cutting down some
trees to keep things really open is apparently beyond the nerve of
conservation commissions or the tolerance of the sub-burghers. But
not everywhere. On Martha's Vineyard, heroic cutting of some of the
state forest and other woodlands, to replace pitchpine with meadow
(the ``heath'' of the extinct Heath Hen) is planned.
</P>
<P>
   Existing open fields are haphazardly managed. If a grassland
bird attempted to nest within a mile of Walden Pond this summer, it
would probably fail, as the towns insist on mowing grass or cutting
hay as soon as it is barely tall enough to shelter a bobolink's
nest. There is a complete list, in the town of Lincoln, of all the
fields where a pair of bobolinks could nest. It includes a big
chunk of the Massachusetts Audubon Society's headquarters. It will
not happen in very many ``conservation fields.'' Farmers take pride
in early hay; residents like short grass, the better to loll upon.
A town of Lincoln absent a boboblink (with its back-formation
nickname ``Robert o' Lincoln'')? One is reminded of Thoreau's
comment quoted by Foster: ``What becomes of the true value of
country life.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoreau's farmers simply didn't have the manpower (hired or
personal) to get through more than a single mowing of their fields,
and they waited for the full growth of autumn. Certain ``native''
birds and butterflies and meadow orchids flourished then that are
near extinction today. ``Conservationists,'' Foster notes, ``find
themselves resorting to highly artificial means (of preserving
grasslands) or extolling the virtues of artificial habitats.''
Indeed, some of the best seasonal birdwatching in Concord and
Lincoln is not at the Audubon Society or on Conservation Commission
land, but on the fringes of Hanscom Field's runways.
</P>
<P>
   It would probably cause a riot if someone suggested cutting down
most of the trees on the top of Mount Misery in Lincoln, one of the
town's most-used public woodlands. But if they did cut, as happened
in Thoreau's day just across the Sudbury River from Mount Misery,
we would, like Thoreau, be surprised to see ``distant well-known
blue mountains on the horizon.'' Indeed, one could see Monadnock
and, on a clear day, Mount Washington. Thoreau was utterly charmed
by the clearing of his hilltop: ``I take this (route) in preference
to all my old familiar walks.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster's book, with its mix of Thoreau himself and thoughts
about Thoreau, will repay any visitor who has previously walked a
mile in Thoreau's footsteps. Reading it will recall scenes _ the
nearly primeval (and occasionally murmuring) pines and the hemlocks
between the grocery store and the Episcopal Church, or the alder
hell surrounding a small stream and its native brooktrout _ and it
will remind the reader, and perhaps comfort the reader, that we are
not alone. We walk behind giants. Not just Henry David, but whoever
it was who had the courage even to begin that stone wall that marks
the far edge of the field.

FLIGHT FROM THE SAD PAST, TOWARD EPIPHANY

THE WAY PEOPLE RUN 
By Christopher Tilghman 
Random House. 209 pp. $21.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christopher Tilghman has chosen a gem of a title for his second
collection of stories: ``The Way People Run.'' The phrase has a few
fine gradations and facets to it, as it yokes together how people
generally operate with the way they leave _ as in run away, and
turn away. And indeed, for many of the characters in Tilghman's
stories, most of whom are men, to live is to avoid. You wind up
these husbands and fathers and sons, and they proceed to take a
step back, away from the conflicts and compromises and commitments
of their lives. Like the lost soul in the story ``A Suitable
Good-bye,'' they are forever ``looking for the exit.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a mistake to characterize Tilghman's second
collection by the cleverness of its title. Like ``In a Father's
Place,'' which quickly established Tilghman as an extraordinary
short-story writer in 1990, the six new pieces are better than
clever. They are cleverly designed, but carried forth with such
naturalness and emotional flow that you don't think much about
authorial wit as you read. Despite the anomie and distance that
trips up his characters' heels, Tilghman's world is a sensual,
organic, and spiritual place in which men are interconnected with
the family members from whom they run, and the American landscapes
through which they run. His world is richly drawn with memory-laden
locales _ from Montana and Mississippi to the Chesapeake Bay region
_ and with the sort of family back stories that give each piece an
almost novel-like feel.
</P>
<P>
   While the stories are quite distinct, they're constructed on a
situation that recurs almost rhythmically throughout the book.
Tilghman returns again and again to people who are facing unwanted
feelings as they revisit a family home _ the old cottage on the
Rappahannock in the first story, ``Something Important,'' for
instance. During a stay at the mildewed house filled with memories
of Aunt Eliza on her wicker settee, a teacher named Peter Ramsey
learns just how successfully he's been running from the awful
truth: He and his wife are so distant that she's actually asked his
brother to tell him their marriage is finished. It's as though
Peter must take a Thomas Wolfe-ian trip home again, in order to
move forward. Likewise in ``Room for Mistakes,'' when a Newton man
travels back to his Montana childhood home for a lesson in the
power of forgiveness _ toward his mother, who has just died, toward
his stepfather, and toward himself. In a single moment, he fathoms
the meaning of mercy.
</P>
<P>
   More than his first collection, ``The Way People Run'' showcases
Tilghman's intuitive sense of pacing, the speed at which human
feeling moves. The emotional shifts that shape each of these dramas
feel entirely true, even fated, no matter how small they may be. He
doesn't manufacture revelations, or pop them like surprises to
create a sense of closure. In the book's saddest piece, ``Things
Left Undone,'' a young couple heals from the death of their son,
but slowly and tentatively, after seasons of alienation between
them. Their reconciliation ``will be enough, not perhaps for every
man and every woman, but for her, and for him, for now.'' The
haunting title story is similarly incremental, as a man on a
job-seeking road trip in the West becomes like an outlaw on the run
from his wife and children, wandering into a prairie town where his
grandfather once lived, sleeping with a strange woman. He is a
father, but he's also a son in need of a guiding light.
</P>
<P>
   The only rigged story of the six is ``The Late Night News,''
about a recently divorced man living a lonely life in ``one of
those big ancestral arks along one of those Chesapeake Bay
rivers.'' A ghostlike confrontation with a burgler shakes him out
of his retreat: ``You know man, you're a mess,'' the burglar tells
him. ``You sitting here in this big house drinking all alone.'' In
a less graceful collection, the schematic, ``Christmas Carol''
setup of this story might not jar as much.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the stories build beautifully to their moments of
relief and understanding _ moments that arrive in their own good
time, frequently unwelcome. What people run from, in some cases, is
freedom from pain. In ``A Suitable Good-bye,'' a depressed New
Yorker named Lee fights off the consolations of family ties. He
takes a train journey to Hattiesburg with his mother, to help her
track down the grave of her father, a suicide. But he can't wait to
run back to his empty New York life, and he finally succumbs to his
profound dodginess and abandons his mother. ``I thought if we stood
on my father's grave, you could see what despair leads to,'' his
mother cries at him before he splits. On the plane back to his
rootless urban life, though, he has a vision of his own
self-annihilation in the person of a hollow businessman drinking
bourbon. For an important moment, he thinks about breaking his
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Tilghman's language is deliberate and straightforward, but with
lovely, knowing flourishes throughout, particularly in the passages
about nature. About the Montana climate in ``Room for Mistakes,''
he writes: ``That was what real cold was, something the cattle
could see, a kind of recognition one could find in the black ice of
their eyes in the morning. In Massachusetts, people liked to talk
about the temperature as if it were a contest; on the Plains, the
cold was private information, like love.'' That's the kind of wise,
visual description you come to expect from Tilghman in ``The Way
People Run,'' a strong collection that grants us access to the
quiet, dignified, and gradual world of ``private information.''

NEW GENERATION OF HOSTS LIVENS UP THE LATE SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even the most casual television viewer knows that mornings on
the tube are talky, afternoons are soapy, evening time is prime,
and each day ends with a choice between the local news and sleep.
</P>
<P>
   But there are 24 hours on the TV clock, and many night owls are
still looking for laughs during what noted funnyman Johann Wolfgang
von Goethe called ``the mournful midnight hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is a pretty good time to be an insomniac, because
a host of youngish comedians are revving up the venerable
late-night talk-show genre and driving it a few places David
Letterman and Jay Leno haven't gone.
</P>
<P>
   On the major networks, a pair of treetop-tall 36-year-old comics
are vying for viewers at 12:35 a.m.: NBC's exuberant Conan O'Brien,
who has surpassed Leno and Letterman as the new gold standard on
late night, and Craig Kilborn, whose CBS show has been more tin
than gold so far but can't yet be counted out.
</P>
<P>
   On cable's Comedy Central, still another 36-year-old comedian,
Jon Stewart, deftly meets the challenge of satirizing TV newscasts,
even though they already do a pretty good job parodying themselves.
On HBO, Dennis Miller _ the group's graybeard at 45 _ unleashes his
pet peeves each Friday night in a polysyllabic, rapid-fire rant
that evokes Lenny Bruce and Mort Sahl. And this fall, 33-year-old
Chris Rock will return to HBO with his own scorching brand of
take-no-prisoners comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Even though these hosts largely adhere to the
monologue-plus-interview format perfected by Johnny Carson, and
they too must feign interest as actors plop down on the couch to
flog their latest projects, make no mistake: These are not your
father's late-night talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   This quintet is more daring, more willing to challenge the
audience, and generally more plugged in to contemporary culture
than Carson ever dreamed of being. In part, that is because
late-night television now seeks demographically correct niches (in
other words, young, educated, free-spending viewers) rather than
trying to please everyone, so hosts aren't automatically blanded
out for a mass audience.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to picture Carson introducing a make-believe kids'
show titled ``The Embryonic Rockabilly Polka-Dotted Fighter
Pilots,'' as O'Brien has done, or featuring performances by rap
artists the way Rock does, or tossing in &QL; 
 &QL; 
references to ``Waiting for Godot'' while complaining about ``the
sprawling, impersonal ganglion'' of hospital rooms, as Miller
recently did.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it's also hard to picture Carson being so cruel as
to wisecrack, as Stewart did upon the death of former child actress
Dana Plato, ``There's got to be an easier way to get on the cover
of People.'' That no-limits ethos is the downside of the new
talk-show hosts.
</P>
<P>
   While pushing envelopes and hot buttons, they sift through
contemporary life and pop culture for one-liners or throwaway
allusions. O'Brien will riff on Ralph Malph, B. L. Stryker, or T.
J. Hooker; Miller will interrupt a rant on modern medicine with a
nostalgic reference to Bones McCoy of ``Star Trek,'' or will greet
a whooping crowd with ``I'm having deja Arsenio vu'' (a line that
inadvertently underscores how much, with the exception of Rock,
late night remains the domain of white males).
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as they do directly to younger viewers, the post-Carson
generation of comics can assume a certain level of fluency in the
language of kitsch. Also in keeping with that youthful skew, the
guests booked on these shows tend to be up-and-comers rather than
established stars _ the likes of Reese Witherspoon, Vivica A. Fox,
Julianne Moore, Angelina Jolie, or Paula Cale of ``Providence.'' In
the interviews, the hosts usually don't dig any deeper than Carson
did: The priority is keeping it fast and funny.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the monologues, let's just say that whatever
their differences, all five hosts are very, very glad that Monica
Lewinsky chose to work at the White House and that Dan Quayle chose
to return to politics. Celebrities in general get roughed up when
the comedians' eyes turn, as they often do, to current events.
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,'' Billy Joel's retirement
was greeted derisively by Stewart with the observation that the
announcement left ``not a dry bulging eye in the house'' and the
question: ``Billy's gone. Will elevators and supermarkets go
silent?'' On ``Dennis Miller Live,'' Miller cracked that ultrathin
Calista Flockhart's ``20/20'' interview went awry when she
``slipped through the molecules on the couch and got stuck in a
subatomic space,'' and mocked Bill Gates for wearing glasses that
``would be too big for the Teddy Roosevelt statue on Mount
Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Late Late Show With Craig Kilborn,'' Kilborn said the
premiere of the new ``Star Wars'' movie featured ``none other than
Mark Hamill, who said through a plate-glass window: `That'll be
$8.50, sir.' '' On ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien,'' on the night
before the presidential impeachment vote in the US Senate, O'Brien
predicted: ``By 1 o'clock tomorrow, President Clinton will be
reclaiming his old table at Hooters.''
</P>
<P>
   But if they share a glee at deflating the famous, there are
distinctions as well among the new voices of late night. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CONAN O'BRIEN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For sheer high spirits and inventiveness, O'Brien outruns the
late-night pack. A former writer, he's got a great comic mind and
is exceptionally quick on his feet; his throwaway quips are more
clever than some comedians' scripted monologues. Six years after he
got off to a very rocky start as Letterman's successor, O'Brien now
hosts the most consistently funny and original show on late night.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien has clearly been influenced by Letterman's absurdist
sensibility, with pseudo-interviews of a randy Clinton bellowing
``Yee-ha!'' and asking ``Do you want to get high?''; segments where
Conan learns to drive a truck and dance in hip-hop style; and bits
featuring characters like Triumph the Insult Comic Dog and Pimpbot
5000 (an android that, in O'Brien's words, ``combines the classic
sensibilities of a 1950s robot with the dynamic flair of a 1970s
street pimp'').
</P>
<P>
   But O'Brien goes Letterman one better by actually seeming happy
to be there, with a nicely unforced style of self-deprecation.
Opening his fifth-anniversary special last year, O'Brien noted that
``it's also the fifth anniversary for the `I Can't Believe That Guy
Has a Show' club.'' He boasted that the special was being simulcast
in Times Square; then a camera panned the square to reveal that the
simulcast was not on the famous giant screen but on a tiny TV in a
hole-in-the-wall store.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien also gives his sidekick, Andy Richter, more running room
than any late-night host ever has, even Letterman with Paul
Shaffer. And the 32-year-old Richter delivers with killer ad-libs
and physical comedy, such as when he was ``tricked'' into
blundering naked onto the set of the ``Today'' show, where Matt
Lauer was preparing an interview.

`SOUTHIE' LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `This movie should have died a million deaths,'' says
``Southie'' writer-actor Jimmy Cummings. ``But it didn't. Because
it was a story that wouldn't die.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the General Cinema screening room in Boston
was packed with people from South Boston for a special screening of
``Southie,'' a tough yet sensitive tale of growing up in that
Boston neighborhood. At the screening are Phil Barrineau, the
neighborhood guy who scouted locations, and Eddie Eaton, who's
spent his whole life in the neighborhood. There's the owner of the
Quencher Tavern and a couple of firemen. This isn't a Hollywood
event, overflowing with celebrities and money men. It isn't about
fame and money. And neither is the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it, man,'' says Cummings, 31, who was born on
Vinton Street in South Boston and began writing the script nearly
six years ago. Producers came and went. Another co-writer came and
went. Actors came and went. Financing came and went. A title came
and went. The release date came and went. The only element holding
it all together was Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't agree to play Danny because of the script,'' says
Donnie Wahlberg, a few weeks later on a sunny afternoon at Suffolk
Downs. ``I agreed to play it because of Jimmy. I just knew he'd get
it done. This movie should have died but it didn't. Because it has
heart _ Jimmy's heart.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Jimmy's heart beat?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bulldog,'' says co-writer-director-actor John Shea,
who's best known for his starring role in Costa-Gavras's
``Missing'' and for playing Lex Luthor on television's ``Lois and
Clark.'' ``He'll do anything to achieve his goals. Anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Cummings wasn't born to make movies. He seemed born to make
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always on the edge and sometimes in the middle of bad
stuff,'' says Cummings, who credits his time at Westwood's Xaverian
High with turning him around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in one day and I had a fight with another kid who had
been humiliating me and I got him down on the ground and punched
him,'' recalls Cummings. ``When I came inside the school, my
homeroom teacher, Mr. Balashi, grabbed me and told me that you
never hit somebody when they're down. It was that sort of thing
that straightened me out. That's why, at the end of the movie, I
have a short list of people I thank. And none of them had anything
to do with the making of the movie. But they had a lot to do with
making me.''
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Cummings moved to New York with some vague
notion that he wanted to act. But it was tough, and he wound up
supporting himself as a doorman and a carpenter, among other jobs.
Things went so badly on the acting front that he decided to write
himself a role. Buoyed by friends' reception of his stories of his
younger days in Boston, he began sketching out a deeply felt tale
of a kid growing up in _ and out of _ his hometown. After making
notes and a rough draft, he approached his pal David McLaughlin,
who was writing a book about New York's Covenant House, to help.
Together they pieced together a story called ``The Big Brass
Ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after working and reworking the script, Cummings got it
to actor and Springfield native Shea, who was then involved in the
``Lois and Clark'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was making the transition from just acting to directing and
acting,'' says Shea, who also plays a policeman in ``Southie.''
``And I really liked the idea of a movie set in South Boston and
written from the inside out. But it needed work.''
</P>
<P>
   And work it got.
</P>
<P>
   Draft after draft. Shea writing and editing on the red-eye back
and forth from Los Angeles. Cummings doing the same in New York.
McLaughlin dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, through promises kept and promises broken, talent
found and lost, financing appearing and disappearing, Cummings
persevered.
</P>
<P>
   The real Rocky
</P>
<P>
   ``I never give up, man. Never,'' says Cummings. ``I'm from
Boston. I mean, I didn't even know what I was doing but I knew I
was doing something right. I'd see these movies that were terrible,
and I knew mine was better. I mean, when I saw `Rocky' I thought it
was me. I know I can go 15 rounds and it didn't make no difference
whether I lost the first 14. I knew I could knock them out in the
last round. And that's exactly how it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked Jimmy's enthusiasm,'' he says. ``And I liked
the idea that it was basically his story. It meant something to
him. And I liked the characters, especially Donnie's.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Southie,'' Donnie Wahlberg plays Danny, a young adult who
returns to South Boston for a wedding. He had left town to shed the
entanglements of family and neighborhood. In order to find himself,
he needed to be alone _ free of being the family caregiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my own story,'' says Wahlberg, who first read the
script in the summer of 1996. ``My heart was in it right off the
bat. I got parts in `Ransom' and `Body Count,' but I wanted to
shoot `Southie.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They shot the film on a shoestring budget. Wahlberg, for
example, paid for a three-room trailer and a hair and makeup person
out of his own pocket. After a 26-day shoot featuring 12-hour days,
the film was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Because there was a rumor that a studio was making a movie from
Orson Welles's script called ``The Big Brass Ring,'' they changed
the title to ``Southie.''
</P>
<P>
   But it still wasn't finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is really bad for independent films,'' says
``Southie'' producer Bill McCutcheon. ``It's getting harder and
harder. But Lion's Gate (the distributor) agreed to open it in
Boston and on the West Coast _ presumably in Seattle, where it did
very well at the Seattle Film Festival _ and we'll go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Cummings is happy. He got out of the movie what he
put into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get that feeling that it's a different world,''
says Cummings, who plays a two-bit, ultraviolent punk in the
picture. ``It's a world you need to leave but can't. It's a
dangerous place, and a loving place.''
</P>
<P>
   During last June's Nantucket Film Festival, Cummings's dreams
came true when the line to see ``Southie'' stretched around the
block at the island's aptly named Dreamland Theater. It was just a
week after the film won the best picture jury prize at the 24th
annual Seattle Film Festival. ``Southie'' was hot.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected delay
</P>
<P>
   So why did it take so long for the film to hit theaters?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the business,'' says Cummings. ``It happened when it
happened because that's when it happened. Only in the movie
business does that make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Lion's Gate was tied up promoting ``Affliction'' and ``Gods and
Monsters,'' two Oscar-nominated films, so ``Southie'' had to wait.
Finally, the local film that finished shooting before ``Good Will
Hunting,'' ``Monument Ave.,'' and ``Next Stop Wonderland'' even
started filming will open.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of ``Southie,'' in a pivotal moment, Danny picks
up a picture of his father. But it's not a photo of his father,
it's a portrait of Jack Cummings, Jimmy's father. An inside homage
to a man who, at 55, was hit by a car and killed in Andrew Square
when his son was 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father lost his job at the newspapers'' _ he worked in the
press room at both the Globe and the Herald at different times _
when I was 6,'' says Cummings. ``He started to drink. That left us,
as a family, in bad shape. He left us with bills. It wasn't good.''
Cummings pauses. ``Did you ever stand in line with those coupons
and watch people watch you? It's humiliating. Then you eat that
awful peanut butter. Man, you can never get the taste of that crap
out of your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's precisely that taste that flavors ``Southie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' concluded Cummings. ``I made it for
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   A movie where no one makes any money. No one gets any fame. And
everyone's happy.

`RYAN' IS GUNNING FOR VIDEO VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan,'' last
year's highest-grossing film, storms the home-video beachhead,
generating anticipation from fans and some anger from video
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The World War II drama was the winner of five Academy Awards,
including best director for Spielberg and best cinematography for
Janusz Kaminski. Retailing for $110, it's a hefty price for many
small video-store owners who need to buy a substantial number of
copies in order to compete with the chains. Each home-video
distributor decides whether to price a tape at $20 for sell-through
to the general market, or to price it for the rental market, in
which case the home-video dealers pay a premium and profits are
generated through renting the tape to consumers. Last year, 20th
Century-Fox and Paramount's ``Titanic'' went directly to the
sell-through market.
</P>
<P>
   But DreamWorks is taking the pricier route, and they don't seem
worried. The orders have come in very strong, and even though the
studio wouldn't confirm the number of copies shipped to stores this
week, a spokesperson said it was a record number. That would put
it, at least, over the 1.1 million copies record established by
20th Century-Fox Home Video when they released ``There's Something
About Mary'' earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Independent video-store owner John Hunt of Hunt's Video Hut in
North Kingstown, R.I., feels the squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for a small store owner because they offer deals if
you buy more than a certain number of copies,'' says Hunt. ``For
`Private Ryan,' if you buy four at the standard rate, they'll sell
you six more at a reduced rate and then buy back the bargain copies
after 90 days. But what if you don't need 10 copies? I bought six,
which is a lot for us, but a lot of customers have been asking for
it. We paid less than $20 for `You've Got Mail' and we can't keep
it on the shelves. There should be more like that to help the
independents.''
</P>
<P>
   The dealer price doesn't affect consumer anticipation. If a
sampling of customers at a variety of Cambridge video stores is any
indication, ``Saving Private Ryan'' may make everyone happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it should have won best picture,'' said Henry
Sasantzky, outside Hollywood Express near Porter Square. ``I'll
rent it and, when it runs its course, I'll buy it as a pre-viewed
copy for $10 or so. Just like `Titanic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan'' has already won the 1998 battle for the box office with
just over $210 million, even though it lost the Academy Award for
best picture to ``Shakespeare in Love.'' According to calculations
provided by DreamWorks, it was listed as the year's best picture by
more than 70 critics and organizations such as the New York, Los
Angeles, Chicago, and London critics' associations.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Goldberg, who plays Private Mellish, the guy who taunts the
Germans, wasn't sure what to expect when the film was originally
released last July. While Tom Hanks is the star, the supporting
cast, including Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Dennis Farina, and Matt
Damon, is what gives the film its depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about the film was a little unusual,'' says
Goldberg, from his home near Los Angeles. ``Even when I read for
it, we read from another script from a film called `A Midnight
Clear.' It felt foolish and pointless but, a few weeks later, I was
in the movie. I didn't even know who I was playing. During the
shooting we would make up lines and situations. Spielberg and
everyone was very open to that. The entire script was in flux.
While we were shooting we'd all contribute, then they'd call in an
assistant and the writer and they'd transcribe and we'd shoot.
There was a lot of improvisation and I think he cast everyone
because he thought we'd fit together. He allowed us a lot of
freedom. The only question I had was whether or not it would
cohere.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Goldberg surprised when he saw the finished film?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that it would be graphic,'' said the Sarah Lawrence
graduate. ``There were entire scenes cut out. But it's hard not to
be overwhelmed by it. I also thought it would be maligned for being
too graphic or people wouldn't like it because it wasn't pro or
antiwar. It wasn't simple. But I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Most actors explain that they take certain roles because of the
great script or a director they'd like to work with, describing the
decision in artistic terms. Not Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only asked my agent one question,'' recalled the actor, who
played Eddie on the hit series ``Friends'' and went on to play
Matthew McConaughey's best friend in Ron Howard's ``EDtv.'' ``Can I
do it in exchange for finishing funds for my movie?''
</P>
<P>
   When the answer came back yes, Goldberg signed on.
</P>
<P>
   That movie is the now-completed ``Scotch and Milk,'' a festival
favorite without a distributor that was written, directed,
produced, and co-edited by Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   It's at the opposite end of the movie spectrum from the
big-budget ``Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's black-and-white, nonlinear, and it's pure and honest,''
he said. ``It wasn't made to be a calling card to something else.''

BACK TO THE FUTURE: COMPANY PLANS MOBILE VIDEO PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN BERGER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Back in the '50s, visionaries knew what the '90s
would be like.
</P>
<P>
   People would rocket to work using a personal jet pack, or maybe
glide in a luxurious hovercar. At home, robots would tend to their
domestic needs. When Mom called, a global citizen of the year 1999
would talk to her on a gleaming videophone.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so maybe the visionaries were a little off.
</P>
<P>
   Robots are crawling through volcanic craters, slaving away on
assembly lines, and pulling dangerous shifts with the bomb squad.
Personal jet packs and hovercars are still languishing in research
and development hell.
</P>
<P>
   And the videophone? In one form or another, the videophone has
been a technical reality for six decades. But it has never caught
on in the consumer marketplace, hampered by high price as well as
cultural and mobility factors. Despite the availability of
technology, our telephones still resemble those of the Flintstones
more than the Jetsons.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing soon. The Kyocera Corp., based in Kyoto,
Japan, has announced the newest version of the device _ a mobile
unit called the Visual Phone VP-210, to be marketed initially in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Will this be the videophone that finally succeeds? Let's take a
look at what's happened to some of its predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The first videoconference took place in a crosstown event, held
by AT&AMP;T's Bell Labs in the 1930s in New York. In 1964, AT&AMP;T
introduced the first actual videophone, according to Gene
Fredericks, president of EdisonWest Inc., a software company based
in Emeryville, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Picturephone, it was a digital device that was too
far ahead of telephone line technology to be used by the general
public. The phone lines around the country at that time lacked a
sufficient capacity to carry data _ what we now call ``bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next several years, various companies _ including
Japanese electronics giants Hitachi and Toshiba _ would introduce
similar products, but these failed to ignite the imagination of the
general public.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors contributed to the videophone's failure to
catch on. Cost and cultural hurdles are two of them.
</P>
<P>
   The first personal video conferencing system, called the Cameo,
was introduced in 1990 by AT&AMP;T and Compression Labs Inc. It worked
with a personal computer _ and cost under $5,000, a breakthrough at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   The videophone is still pricey, and corporate-quality
videoconferencing equipment is even pricier. Just a few years ago,
a business teleconferencing set-up could cost $40,000 or more. The
trend now is toward cheaper systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price point for decent quality systems has been getting
below $5,000 per unit, and some even lower than that,'' said
Fredericks, who spent several years designing and implementing
videoconferencing systems. Relatively low-quality systems can cost
as little as $1,000 per unit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While such prices put middle to high-end videoconferencing
within reach of most businesses, it's still too much for the
consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   The low end, however, is beginning to fall in line.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-based videoconferencing products have made the biggest
dent in consumer-market prices _ under $300 (not including the
price of the computer) for a hardware/software bundle called
``Create and Share,'' made by the Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Some actual videophones _ standalone units without a computer _
retail for less. Kyocera's mobile Visual Phone is set to debut with
a suggested retail price around 40,000 yen _ roughly equivalent to
$325.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-based products require a certain level of comfort with
technology on the part of the consumer, and also require the
consumer to have friends with the same levels of comfort and
disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   Although some computer makers, such as the Compaq Computer
Corp., have started bundling videophone technology into
plug-and-play desktop computers, such setups are still more the
exception than the rule.
</P>
<P>
   But the advance of computer technology and the dawn of the
Internet have also helped by breeding a culture that is more ready
for a product like the videophone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have the Net and Web-based things, and that kind
of connectivity, people are getting used to the notion'' that
information can be shared in nontraditional ways, Fredericks said.
``That's something that's wholly new. A technology can sit dormant
waiting for another technology to make it a cogent success.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing presence of the Web has sparked some interest among
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Primevision Technologies, a teleconferencing consulting firm and
retailer of related products and computers based in Pleasanton,
Calif., splits its business pretty evenly between consumers and
businesses, according to Ven Baisa, Primevision's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   He said families with children in college are increasingly
turning to computer-based teleconferencing technology to make a
more personal connection between home and school.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Primevision's products require a computer to work,
although Baisa said some standalone units cost as little as $250
each _ with the caveat, of course, that both ends of the
conversation must have the same unit in order to use the video
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Mobility issues also have hampered the use of videophone
technology, but they are less obvious obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of wireless and cellular phones, people are
resistant to the idea of sitting still, staying in the frame of a
videophone camera.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significantly, the stationary model videophone
curtails what the product can do _ all it's good for is showing the
faces of the people on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The new mobile Visual Phone breaks that barrier and opens up
new, utilitarian possibilities for the technology.

<P>
   HONOLULU _ Frank Hartwell was in a cheerful mood as he finished
his rounds as a tour guide on the USS Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? He could personally share in the collective pride
over Mighty Mo, one of America's most celebrated warships.
Hartwell, who joined the Navy while his family was living in Santa
Monica, had been assigned to the destroyer Satterlee during World
War II, and had guarded the Missouri's flank during the furious
battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had picket duty. We formed the protection ring around
her,'' Hartwell said. He laughed. ``In other words, we were
expendable. Our job was to keep the kamikazes (Japanese suicide
bombers) off the big ships.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he stood just a few feet from a plaque on the Missouri's
deck that commemorates the exact spot where Japan signed a
surrender document in September 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was shining here in Hawaii. Douglas MacArthur's voice,
recorded at the surrender ceremony, boomed from a loudspeaker
overhead: ``May God preserve it ... These proceedings are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hartwell's enjoyment of the moment was short-lived, as is
the case with most visitors to the Missouri, which has tied up in
Pearl Harbor since the end of January. Even on these decks, the eye
is naturally drawn forward, to a point just off the bow, where the
gleaming white USS Arizona Memorial lies silently in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've visited it nine times,'' Hartwell said. ``I can't help
choking up every time, seeing those 1,177 names. It just grabs
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two memorials, in unique juxtaposition, seize
visitors in radically different ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona is a symbol of the start of America's war in the
Pacific. In Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, it was
torn apart when a bomb from overhead crashed into an ammunition
magazine, sending the battleship to the harbor floor in less than
nine minutes. Its loss of 1,177 crewmen _ 77 percent of the 1,535
men assigned to the ship at the time _ constitutes the single
greatest naval disaster in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri, with its famous Surrender Deck, represents the
other bookend of World War II _ its conclusion. And its history is
as storied as the Arizona's is tragic. The Missouri, whose hull was
laid in 1941, was in action as recently as 1991, when its tomahawk
missiles pounded Iraqi positions in Kuwait and Baghdad during
Operation Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri was decommissioned the next year (the second time
in its history it had been mothballed) and ultimately came to rest
here as a kind of museum at anchor. As if in a symbolically
protective gesture, the Missouri's famed 16-inch guns point
directly over the top of the Arizona, which lies submerged a few
hundred feet away.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Mo has already proven to be an irresistible lure for
tourists stopping in to see the Arizona. In its first two months
here, it drew 88,852 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Its contrasts with the Arizona extend well beyond the histories
of the two ships. The USS Arizona Memorial is administered by the
National Park Service, and its documentary film, boat ride into the
harbor and visit to the memorial are all provided at no cost. The
Battleship Missouri Memorial is maintained by the private USS
Missouri Memorial Association, and it charges adults anywhere from
$10 for general admission to $29 for a deluxe tour.
</P>
<P>
   As a tourist attraction, the Missouri is very much in a state of
evolution. ``Since opening (it), we've found that visitors are
fascinated about seeing its interior and how sailors lived and
worked,'' said Don Hess, the memorial's vice president of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the curiosity, the memorial association is
gradually making over various rooms in the ship as exhibits in an
attempt to show how they were used.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, visitors can peek in on an officer's stateroom and
the ward room, and wander through the bridge. As an inducement to
pop for the higher-priced tour, the ship recently opened its combat
engagement center _ the ship's nerve center during an attack _ to
its Signature Tour patrons only.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, there are further plans to open the
mess deck and crew berthing area. ``If you come back a year from
now, there will be so much more open,'' said spokesman Patrick
Dugan. ``We just need time to get it all ready. It came into Hawaii
on Father's Day last year, and it needed some work. It was rusty.
It needed a paint job. A lot of work was done before its grand
opening in January.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for the standard admission _ $10 for adults, $6 for
children ages 4 to 12 _ the Missouri is well worth the visit.
</P>
<P>
   It's intriguing to walk through the area of the Surrender Deck,
where black-and-white photos of the event are displayed and
MacArthur's voice transports you back into history.
</P>
<P>
   Another visitors' favorite: the 16-inch guns, which stretch out
ominously along the forward deck. They were capable of firing
2,000-pound shells for distances of 20 miles or more. Imagine a Geo
Metro being tossed from Catalina Island and taking out the Ports o'
Call restaurant in San Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Missouri are collected at a ticket booth next to
the USS Arizona Memorial parking lot, then ferried over the bridge
to Ford Island on open-air trolleys.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, the ship already shows signs of being
cluttered up with tourist trappings. The pier alongside it, for
example, has become home to all manner of military vehicles (many
draped with camouflage netting) that have absolutely nothing to do
with naval warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona, by contrast, is maintaining a longstanding
tradition of quiet dignity. At this hallowed site, anything more
would be crass.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are first given a priority number. It is essential:
Some 1.5 million people visit this park every year, with the summer
months experiencing the greatest crush.
</P>
<P>
   When your number is called, you file into a theater to watch a
brief documentary film. Mercifully, the lights are dimmed for this
presentation; many visitors, particularly those who are old enough
to have lived through Pearl Harbor and the horrors of the war, dab
at their eyes as details of the Arizona's demise are presented.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unbelievably lucky shot, really. A Japanese plane
dropped a 1,760-pound armor-piercing bomb that landed alongside the
second turret, crashed through four decks and detonated in the
ship's forward ammunition magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The concussion, according to Walter Lord's 1957 best seller
``Day of Infamy,'' was more like a ``whoom'' than a ``bang,'' but
it was so great that it stalled the engine of a pickup truck being
driven along Ford Island by an aviation ordnance man.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion literally blew off the Arizona's bow and ignited
fires that burned for 2{ days. In less than nine minutes, the ship
was at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was well-timed, because seven U.S. battleships were
lined up like cars at a toll booth along the east side of Ford
Island: the Nevada, Arizona, Tennessee, West Virginia, Maryland,
Oklahoma and California. (Today, the Missouri is tied up roughly
where the Maryland and Oklahoma sat side by side.)
</P>
<P>
   The element of surprise in the attack was also extreme. U.S.
practice for an attack had been so extensive that in the early
stages the presumption was widespread _ from lowest rank to highest
_ that this was just another drill. According to Lord's book, one
commander even assumed that a diving plane was some hot-dogging
U.S. aviator, and tried to get the number on the plane to report
him.
</P>
<P>
   Early warning systems were fairly primitive in that day, too,
but one was working fine. The story of its operation is one of the
most wrenching of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   At a radar placement near Kahuku on Oahu's north shore, the
screen suddenly filled with blips just after 7 a.m. _ nearly an
hour before the attack would begin. The operators had picked up the
first wave of Japanese attack planes, launched from aircraft
carriers 230 miles to the north of the island. But when the
operators, both privates, breathlessly relayed their news to an
Army lieutenant at Fort Shafter on the western outskirts of
Honolulu, the lieutenant surmised that the they'd merely picked up
a cluster of inbound U.S. planes and told them, ``Look, don't worry
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese arrived at Pearl Harbor about a half hour later,
and carried out their two-hour attack nearly without challenge.
</P>
<P>
   As devastating as the attack was, it could have been much worse.
The American fleet of aircraft carriers was out to sea at the time,
and it would prove to be a key component of the war in the Pacific.
Also, while the attack pilots concentrated on the ships in the
harbor, they ignored the repair and construction facilities, the
fuel storage tanks and the submarine base.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the U.S. was able to recover rather quickly. In fact,
although Battleship Row endured the brunt of the attack, five of
the seven ships were salvaged and were back in action during the
war. Only two were utter losses: the Oklahoma, which capsized, and
the Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Today, visitors assemble on a sun-washed dock to climb into the
launch that will carry them to the USS Arizona Memorial. The boat
is manned by young sailors in crisp white uniforms. It's impossible
to look at them and not think of their Navy forebears, slowly
stirring on a Sunday morning 58 years ago, oblivious to the sudden
tragedy that was about to be visited on them from high overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At the memorial itself, conversation tends to be hushed. The
184-foot slab of concrete spans the midsection of the ship, and the
hulk lies just inches below the surface of the water, an aft turret
and other rusted remnants protruding here and there. Many of the
crewmen remain entombed below.
</P>
<P>
   In the shrine room, at the end closest to Ford Island, a marble
wall contains the names of the ship's 1,177 dead _ which represent
more than half of the 2,340 military deaths suffered in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   It's a moving experience to survey the names, all the more so if
you've heard a personal remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   My dad used to play baseball in Princeville, Ill., with one of
these guys. Jack Sniff. Said to be a pretty good pitcher as a
teen-ager before duty called. And there he is, listed among the
U.S. Marines who were assigned to the Arizona: J.B. Sniff, CPL.
</P>
<P>
   Later, out on the center section of the memorial, park ranger
Mary Kalishevich indicated a slick of oil near the protruding
turret. No, she says, that did not come from the launch that
brought us out here. It still gurgles forth from this sunken ship,
all these years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea how much oil was on the ship when she was
sunk,'' Kalishevich said, ``and we have no idea how much oil is
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a myth out here _ that when the last survivor dies,
she will stop crying tears of oil for her crewmen to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO &QL; 
GETTING THERE: From Waikiki or downtown Honolulu, follow the H-1
freeway west to the USS Arizona/Stadium exit, which is No. 15A.
Follow the signs to the memorial, which is directly off state route
99. The ticket booth for the Battleship Missouri Memorial is next
to the USS Arizona Memorial parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   COSTS: There is no charge to visit the USS Arizona Memorial.
Admission for the Battleship Missouri Memorial is $10 for adults,
$6 for children ages 4 to 12 (3 and under free). Guided tours are
an additional $4 per person. The Missouri Signature Tour, which
includes round-trip transportation from Waikiki hotels and access
to areas of the ship not open to the general public, costs $29 for
adults, $19 for children ages 4 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   HOURS: The USS Arizona Memorial is open seven days a week, 7
a.m. to 5 p.m.; closed Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day.
The first showing of the documentary film is at 7:45 a.m. in the
summer (8 a.m. the rest of the year). The last program of the day
begins at 3 p.m. The Battleship Missouri Memorial is open daily
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

N.Y. LAWMAKERS STILL WAITING FOR THEIR PAYCHECKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARA JAKES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The new law that withholds legislators' salaries
until they approve a state budget has been declared
unconstitutional by a Brooklyn judge.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawmakers, who by now have missed their third paycheck,
still will not see their state wages until Gov. George Pataki has
finished appealing the court ruling, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-page decision Friday, state Supreme Court Justice
Richard Huttner ruled that the law ``coerced'' legislators into
making fiscal decisions and could lead them to ``sacrifice (their)
consciously held beliefs'' in order to avoid personal financial
woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strikes at the very heart of our republican form of
government wherein all legislative power is derived from the
people,'' Huttner said. ``To place any legislator, or anyone in any
branch of the government, under undue economic pressure in
exercising his or her judgment while expecting that person to act
in accordance with his or her oath of office is illogical, unsound
and unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   The pay-withholding measure was approved overwhelmingly by the
legislature during a special session in December as part of a deal
to hike lawmakers' salaries by 39 percent to $79,500 annually. It
requires lawmakers, but not the governor, to go without pay until a
state budget, which is nearly eight weeks late, is passed. The
state's fiscal year began April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after they began missing paychecks, 14 Democratic
legislators _ all but one from New York City _ sued the state. The
lawsuit charged that the measure gives too much power to the
executive and could put legislators in a position where they might
be inclined, or perceived to be inclined, to acquiesce on budget
issues out of personal interest.
</P>
<P>
   Huttner's decision does not order the state to release
legislators' withheld pay.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Health Committee Chairman Richard Gottfried, a
Manhattan Democrat who led the court battle against the measure,
said, ``I felt from the start that the purpose of this law is to
use personal financial pressure to try to bludgeon legislators into
caving into the governor's budget cuts. I'm happy the court agrees
that this is unconscionable in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   After learning about the court's decision, Comptroller H. Carl
McCall, a Democrat, ordered his office to release the paychecks
from the vault where they have been stored since the legislature's
first missed payday. The comptroller's office issues paychecks. But
the state treasurer, whose office is part of the governor's
Republican administration, is actually responsible for distributing
them. And that won't happen until Pataki has exhausted his appeals
options, said spokesman Patrick McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their paychecks will continue to be withheld if they would
rather sue for their paychecks rather than work for them,''
McCarthy said, adding that the governor was not surprised at the
judge's ruling. Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat who is
defending the state in the matter, said an appeal would be filed
within days.

E-COMMERCE IS FOR EVERYONE, AUTHOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Electronic commerce still may be in its infancy,
but there are already scores of cheerleaders and skeptics on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the latest voices heard come from Thomas Siebel, founder
and chairman of the business software maker Siebel Systems Inc.,
and Pat House, executive vice president and co-founder of Siebel
Systems. The two have written ``Cyber Rules: Strategies For
Excelling at E-business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyber Rules'' explains how e-commerce will change the way
companies do business in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Siebel, who helped Larry Ellison get the Oracle Corp. off the
ground in the 1980s, said all companies should conduct at least
some of their business over the Web. He spoke about e-commerce in a
recent interview:
</P>
<P>
   Question: In your view, how exactly will the Internet change the
way we do business?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: This is a total paradigm shift. This is one of the
inflection points in history. Most businesses will shift their
business model to incorporate e-business and make that part of
their distribution mix.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will traditional businesses fall by the wayside?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The Internet is just one of the ways we're going to do
business.
</P>
<P>
   In a lot of transactions there's no substitute for human
interaction. If you're going to get a new ad campaign for
Coca-Cola, you're not going to do this just over the Internet. You
have to meet with ad people and plan.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of these discussions imply the Internet replaces sales
people and stores. That's just a bunch of bunk. Storefronts will
continue to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What types of jobs will e-commerce eliminate?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't see any jobs being eliminated. I just see more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs aren't that different from non e-commerce jobs. You
still have marketing, sales, human resources. The jobs are
essentially the same. Just the distribution channel changes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There has also been a lot of talk about how e-commerce will
reduce companies' operating costs. How will this happen?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not about reducing costs. It is about applying
information and communication technology to establish and maintain
customer relationships and provide much, much higher levels of
service.
</P>
<P>
   Companies will have to deal with razor-thin margins, and they'll
have to deal in volume.
</P>
<P>
   The market is global. Innovative, visionary companies see the
future. Those people who don't make this transition will cease to
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This assumes that all companies need to take a global
approach to business? Is this possible or necessary?
</P>
<P>
   A: When you go to Europe, the borders are gone. To not take
advantage of large market opportunities is not rational for the
business person.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there any industries that cannot take advantage of e-
commerce?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't see any industries that won't be totally changed by
this.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers can use (the Internet) to buy fertilizer and sell
cattle. The family farm is going to buy and market its products
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There are companies that will take advantage of this paradigm
shift and be the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   There are companies that won't and will get wiped out. For
example, those companies that didn't make the transition to
computer-aided manufacturing in the '70s and '80s got wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Despite all the interest in doing business over the Net, few
e-commerce companies are making money. How and when will these
businesses turn profits?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right now, these companies are getting their valuations from
things other than profits. It's their ability to aggregate users.
</P>
<P>
   One of these days we're going to have a crisis in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading company like Oracle will announce their stock has
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Then the market will drop by some crazy number. Then these
Internet stocks will drop. Then they're going to start focusing on
their profits.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com could make a profit, but their board's not telling
them to make a profit. The board is telling them to spend.
(Seattle-based Amazon.com, the online book seller, recorded a loss
of $61.7 million on sales of $293.6 million for the quarter ended
March 31.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: When will profits become more important to Internet
businesses?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd be amazed if this doesn't happen in the next 24 months.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are so many Internet startups in our midst. How many
will survive?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ninety-five to 97 percent will fail. There's a market excess
here.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets don't know how to deal with this revolution
yet. Valuations are 100 times more than they deserve. Right now,
they're valued on unbridled enthusiasm. That's a temporary
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   When these markets collapse, it won't be the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Companies will just get reasonable valuations, but the
underlying effect to the economy will be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you respond to e-commerce naysayers who say the
industry is mostly hype?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are a lot of people that contended for many, many years
that the Earth was flat. Some of them used to be experts in their
field. They were wrong.

 &HT;    Don't expect top quality at a cut-rate price
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A guy brought his car back to a tire dealer complaining that the
tires were only six months old and already worn out. Sure enough,
the mechanic confirmed both front tires were worn down to the cord
on the inside while the outer edges showed almost new tread.
</P>
<P>
   The customer's receipt validated the mechanic's suspicion. A
wheel alignment had been recommended when the tires were purchased,
yet the customer had declined the work. The customer's disgruntled
explanation was, ``Yeah, I know how you guys operate. They wanted
to charge me another $300 for parts they claimed were worn out
before they would even align it. I found this other guy who would
do the work for less than half of what your shop wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you taken the car back to the guy who did the work?''
asked the mechanic. ``The tire wear is due to improper alignment,
not defective tires.''
</P>
<P>
   The customer replied, ``Yeah, sure I took it back! He claims the
tires are faulty and should be replaced free of charge.''
</P>
<P>
   The mechanic saw an argument brewing and decided a direct
explanation wouldn't work. He suggested putting the car on the rack
so they could determine the reason for the tire wear. A quick but
thorough inspection of the front end revealed excessive looseness
caused by several worn components. It was also apparent that no
parts had been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did this guy say he fixed on your car?'' queried the
mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know exactly. He said he put on a couple of
good, used parts. I told him just to patch it up 'cause I was going
to sell it. Say, can't you just tighten up some of this stuff and
align it close?''
</P>
<P>
   The mechanic's patience faltered.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Every time the vehicle moves, the alignment changes
because the parts are worn out. I'm sure an intelligent fellow like
you can now understand that trying to patch this car together with
used parts wasn't a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what are your options now? You can take the car back to the
guy who worked on it and give him a chance to make it right. You
can try to sell the car the way it is, or you can get the front end
fixed and chalk your losses up to experience. In any case, you're
going to have to buy new tires. Alignment wear is not the tire
manufacturer's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   All of us have probably had an experience similar to this. We
budgeted for a specific purchase only to be unpleasantly surprised
by unforeseen problems. Our first instinct might be to try to find
someone to patch it up just until we can afford to get it fixed
right.
</P>
<P>
   But that usually gets us in more trouble than we started with.
Most reputable repair shops avoid patch jobs because they always
come back with an angry customer in tow. Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   Don't be afraid to ask questions. Reputable shops encourage
questions. Questions convey your interest in what is happening with
your vehicle. It also gives you a chance to form an opinion about
the shop. Nobody expects you to understand every nut and bolt in
your vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't understand an answer, ask them to repeat it in
plain English. Sometimes service people forget and slip into
technicese without realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the service adviser or mechanic to explain the exact nature
of the problem including the consequences that might be incurred if
the repair isn't performed immediately. Don't ask, ``How long can I
drive it this way?'' or ``How many miles before it breaks?''
</P>
<P>
   No one can estimate the actual time and place of total failure.
When there are several problems, ask for a prioritized list so you
can budget accordingly. If possible, ask them to show you what
needs to be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget to inquire about parts and labor guarantees,
warranties and the mechanic's qualifications. Get it in writing.
</P>
<P>
   You always have the option of a second opinion. Don't expect
comparable price or quality between a reputable shop and a shop
that uses cut-rate or used parts. You should expect to pay a
diagnostic fee as you would if you were getting a second opinion
from a doctor. Beware of freebies. Those ``get you in the door''
techniques are rarely free.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you actually find a shop that agrees to patch up
your car (just long enough for you to sell it), you're in the wrong
place.

 &HT;    Summer-loving Jeep Wrangler a guilty pleasure
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever noticed that sometimes in life you find that you
like things that common sense tells you are not necessarily good
for you?
</P>
<P>
   They're usually relatively harmless _ like pizza and cotton
candy, platform shoes or acrylic fingernails _ and all that matters
is that we like them.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of the Jeep Wrangler. It's everything that
a vehicle shouldn't be and at the same time everything that a
sport-utility should be.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because it began as the pure utility vehicle commonly
known as the jeep during its original days serving the U.S. armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Wrangler, while a bit more gussied up than the military
issue, is truly a world apart from the truck-based luxury liners
that most people refer to as sport-utilities. Even its corporate
cousin, the elegant Jeep Grand Cherokee, has to be a very distant
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   My test vehicle was equipped with a canvas top and
zip-in-and-out plastic windows. As I kept up with traffic on the
interstate, the windows would blow out.
</P>
<P>
   Entry and exit were not exactly graceful. True to its heritage,
the Wrangler side body extends four or five inches above the floor
surface. It quickly becomes an up-over-and-down entry maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   The front windshield is a real novelty in today's automotive
market. It's flat, and the Wrangler's headlights are round.
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards, the Wrangler is pretty basic. It also
happens to be a supremely ``happy'' vehicle. It makes you feel good
every time you get in.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the enigma. There is really nothing about the
Wrangler that, by all of today's standards, should make it
endearing, but it is.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that it is about as close to driving an adult
version of your kiddie pedal-car as you can get? Does it allow you
to revisit your first, second or perhaps even third childhood?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the spirited performance of the 4.0-liter
engine coupled to a five-speed manual transmission is a relatively
light package that gets your adrenaline flowing? Or could it be
that sometimes less truly is more?
</P>
<P>
   The Wrangler Sport has the contemporary necessities such as dual
air bags (passenger-side with a shutoff switch) and a cupholder,
but the experience of driving is not marred by a host of gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   While a tux and a prom dress might be a bit uncomfortable in the
Wrangler's bucket seats, cutoff jeans, wet swimsuits and the wind
in your hair and the sun in your face are made to order for this
summer-loving vehicle.

used parts wasn't a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what are your options now? You can take the car back to the
guy who worked on it and give him a chance to make it right. You
can try to sell the car the way it is, or you can get the front end
fixed and chalk your losses up to experience. In any case, you're
going to have to buy new tires. Alignment wear is not the tire
manufacturer's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   All of us have probably had an experience similar to this. We
budgeted for a specific purchase only to be unpleasantly surprised
by unforeseen problems. Our first instinct might be to try to find
someone to patch it up just until we can afford to get it fixed
right.
</P>
<P>
   But that usually gets us in more trouble than we started with.
Most reputable repair shops avoid patch jobs because they always
come back with an angry customer in tow. Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   Don't be afraid to ask questions. Reputable shops encourage
questions. Questions convey your interest in what is happening with
your vehicle. It also gives you a chance to form an opinion about
the shop. Nobody expects you to understand every nut and bolt in
your vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't understand an answer, ask them to repeat it in
plain English. Sometimes service people forget and slip into
technicese without realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the service adviser or mechanic to explain the exact nature
of the problem including the consequences that might be incurred if
the repair isn't performed immediately. Don't ask, ``How long can I
drive it this way?'' or ``How many miles before it breaks?''
</P>
<P>
   No one can estimate the actual time and place of total failure.
When there are several problems, ask for a prioritized list so you
can budget accordingly. If possible, ask them to show you what
needs to be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget to inquire about parts and labor guarantees,
warranties and the mechanic's qualifications. Get it in writing.
</P>
<P>
   You always have the option of a second opinion. Don't expect
comparable price or quality between a reputable shop and a shop
that uses cut-rate or used parts. You should expect to pay a
diagnostic fee as you would if you were getting a second opinion
from a doctor. Beware of freebies. Those ``get you in the door''
techniques are rarely free.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you actually find a shop that agrees to patch up
your car (just long enough for you to sell it), you're in the wrong
place.

 &HT;    Summer-loving Jeep Wrangler a guilty pleasure
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever noticed that sometimes in life you find that you
like things that common sense tells you are not necessarily good
for you?
</P>
<P>
   They're usually relatively harmless _ like pizza and cotton
candy, platform shoes or acrylic fingernails _ and all that matters
is that we like them.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of the Jeep Wrangler. It's everything that
a vehicle shouldn't be and at the same time everything that a
sport-utility should be.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because it began as the pure utility vehicle commonly
known as the jeep during its original days serving the U.S. armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Wrangler, while a bit more gussied up than the military
issue, is truly a world apart from the truck-based luxury liners
that most people refer to as sport-utilities. Even its corporate
cousin, the elegant Jeep Grand Cherokee, has to be a very distant
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   My test vehicle was equipped with a canvas top and
zip-in-and-out plastic windows. As I kept up with traffic on the
interstate, the windows would blow out.
</P>
<P>
   Entry and exit were not exactly graceful. True to its heritage,
the Wrangler side body extends four or five inches above the floor
surface. It quickly becomes an up-over-and-down entry maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   The front windshield is a real novelty in today's automotive
market. It's flat, and the Wrangler's headlights are round.
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards, the Wrangler is pretty basic. It also
happens to be a supremely ``happy'' vehicle. It makes you feel good
every time you get in.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the enigma. There is really nothing about the
Wrangler that, by all of today's standards, should make it
endearing, but it is.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that it is about as close to driving an adult
version of your kiddie pedal-car as you can get? Does it allow you
to revisit your first, second or perhaps even third childhood?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the spirited performance of the 4.0-liter
engine coupled to a five-speed manual transmission is a relatively
light package that gets your adrenaline flowing? Or could it be
that sometimes less truly is more?
</P>
<P>
   The Wrangler Sport has the contemporary necessities such as dual
air bags (passenger-side with a shutoff switch) and a cupholder,
but the experience of driving is not marred by a host of gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   While a tux and a prom dress might be a bit uncomfortable in the
Wrangler's bucket seats, cutoff jeans, wet swimsuits and the wind
in your hair and the sun in your face are made to order for this
summer-loving vehicle.
</P>

Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, May 25:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BLACK-HOLES (Undated) _ The sudden, random and faraway
flashes of gamma radiation, known as gamma ray bursts, seem to be
cosmic birth announcements of a phenomenon of awesome power, one
predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity but shrouded
in mystery because no light can escape the dark clutches of its
consuming gravity. If current hypotheses are correct, Dr. Tsvi
Piran of Columbia University said at a recent four-day symposium at
the Space Telescope Science Institute, ``each gamma ray burst is
signaling the creation of a new black hole.'' By John Noble
Wilford. (1975 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WEIGHT-FAT (Undated) _ For three decades now, Americans have
been bombarded with advice to eat less fat for the sake of their
hearts and their waistlines. But now a growing number of nutrition,
health and obesity specialists maintain that in trying to squeeze
some of the heart-damaging grease from our high-fat diets, they
have sent Americans the wrong message. It's not fat per se that's
the problem, the experts now say, but the kinds of fats Americans
eat and the other kinds of foods they fill up on when they cut back
on appetite-satisfying fat. By Jane E. Brody. (1900 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RESEARCH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Duke's recent problems with a
Federal review board illuminates the increasing stresses on that
hospital and university review boards face and the new
aggressiveness by the Federal agency that oversees them, the Office
of Protection from Research Risks. The review boards, which check
the safety and efficacy of experiments on humans, generally work on
their own time with little or no staff and virtually no training.
By Philip J. Hilts. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SMALLPOX (Undated) _ The Doctor's World: Smallpox, an
ancient disease, was eradicated 20 years ago. Smallpox, the virus,
is on death row, frozen in two highly protected laboratories in the
United States and Russia. Like lawyers filing last minute briefs,
American scientists recently found new arguments for public health
research requiring use of the virus in future laboratory
experiments. Last week, with the U.S. and Russia reversing earlier
decisions to destroy the smallpox virus, the World Health
Organization granted the virus yet another stay. It is good for at
least three years beyond the June 30 date that had been set for its
destruction in ovens. By Lawrence K. Altman Jr. (1750 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FLAG-PRESERVE (Undated) _ Using technology as new as space
age fabrics and as ordinary as the chemicals from the corner
dry-cleaning shop, scientists and historians here have taken on the
job of cleaning and preserving the Star-Spangled Banner, the flag
that flew over Fort McHenry in Baltimore in 1814, so that it might
last at least another 185 years. By Irvin Molotsky. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Items on decoding backward speech sounds,
winds on Jupiter and storms on Mars. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WEIGHT-MORPH (Undated) _ The software in a body morphing
machine shows users what they might look like if they lost 15
percent of their weight or, show a 30 percent gain. Then it tells
details users' chances of contracting various weight-related
maladies _ heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure _ worsen
and improve with the changes. By Eric Nagourney. (425 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ONLINE-FITNESS (Undated) _ On-line training: The Internet is
awash with gymnasts and fitness competitors, body builders, coaches
and trainers willing to sign up clients for online fitness. The
system has its advantages, including the anonymity. This writer
emerged 17 pounds lighter, capable of sleeping through the night
for the first time in her life, energetic, fit and strong. By
Marion Roach. (1375 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: In the early '70s,
celebrity dieters and wishful thinkers propelled Dr. Robert C.
Atkins's self-styled ``diet revolution'' into a national phenomenon
that sent shivers of despair through the promoters of sound
nutrition and public health. Despite warnings of a possible heart
attack on every page, ``Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution,'' a book that
promoted a high-fat, high-protein diet and spurned all
carbohydrates, was bought by 10 million Americans whose growing
reliance on labor-saving devices and fast foods had spawned thunder
thighs and rendered their waistlines obsolete. But the Atkins
scheme was neither new nor revolutionary then and is really no
different from his ``new diet revolution,'' published in 1992 and
now enjoying a resurgence of popularity among countless
weight-conscious women and carnivorous men seeking a quick and
painless route to a slimmer summer. By Jane E. Brody. (1450 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WEIGHT-PILLS (Undated) _ In their eagerness to take pills
that will help them slim down, people may conveniently overlook
something that doctors remember all too well: weight-loss drugs
have had an alarming history. By Denise Grady. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WEIGHT-REBOUND (Undated) _ It is a depressing article of
faith among the overweight and the professionals who treat them
that 95 percent of people who lose weight regain it _ and sometimes
more _ within a few months or years. That statistic has been quoted
widely over the last four decades, from Congressional hearings to
diet books to research papers and seminars. And it is the reason so
many people approach dieting with a sense of hopelessness. But
there is a problem with that piece of conventional wisdom: There is
no scientific basis for it. In fact, obesity researchers say that
no one has an accurate idea of what percentage of the population
can maintain a weight loss over the long term. By Jane Fritsch.
(1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Though it has been well established that most peptic ulcers
are caused by a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori,
and can be effectively treated with antibiotics, recent studies
show that that information has not gotten out to ulcer sufferers,
and a large number of doctors were continuing to treat with
standard acid blockers only. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Many teen-agers experience stress, but the patterns of stress
girls encounter may leave them more vulnerable to depression than
the patterns of stress boys experience according to the results of
a study that appears in the current issue of the journal Child
Development. (400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions answered: Pluto sometimes
crosses the orbit of Neptune, suggesting to me that they might
collide at some point. Should I worry? (300 words)

UNIVERSITIES' HOSPITAL MERGER LEADS TO NEW PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The 1997 merger of the medical centers of the
University of California at San Francisco and Stanford University
was supposed to save them from financial ruin, but a steady stream
of bad news from the hospital system has left many questioning the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of streamlining services and getting better prices on
drugs and supplies, the merger added 1,000 employees, a new set of
executive offices and, some say, distractions from the hospitals'
core missions.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, it has not shielded them from the financial distress
being felt by academic medical centers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The merger was supposed to help protect the hospitals _ UCSF
Mount Zion and UCSF Medical Center in San Francisco and Stanford
Hospital and the Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital in Palo
Alto _ from projected loss of revenue from cuts in Medicare,
Medicaid and from lower private insurance payments.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents claimed the merger would improve the combined bottom
line by $256 million between 1997 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, UCSF Stanford Health Care officials say they will run
up a $135 million debt by next year if they don't immediately slash
the budget and eliminate 2,000 of the system's 12,500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The system also announced recently that it must find yet another
$100 million _ either through cuts or increased revenues _ to make
it comfortably through 2001. That could mean closing in-patient
hospital care and perhaps the emergency room at Mount Zion.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of mounting losses and resulting cuts on patient care
remains to be seen. Unions and faculty members say the future looks
grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to continue to spiral the system into the ground,''
said Karen MacLeod of the University Professional and Technical
Employees union. ``We cannot keep making cuts like this and not
believe it's going to have serious, permanent effects on the
hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Claims that the merger would lead to a more cost-effective
operation ``proved to be absolutely and totally incorrect,'' Frank
W. Clark Jr., a longtime opponent of the merger, told fellow UC
regents last week.
</P>
<P>
   Several other regents, who voted to transfer UCSF's hospitals to
a private corporation owned jointly with Stanford, also expressed
unease with the results.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and employee unions, who opposed the merger, are beating
the drum for its dissolution. Even those who continue to support it
agree it hasn't turned out as they had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, we failed badly in the management of the
operation,'' UC President Richard Atkinson told regents last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread grumbling, momentum for a divorce does not
appear to be sweeping the campuses. Some doctors believe the merger
could lead to fruitful collaborations at the two affiliated medical
schools, but those opportunities are being overwhelmed by the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ills of the world have been blamed on the merger,'' said
Ken Melmon, chairman of the academic senate at Stanford Medical
School. ``I think the faculty at Stanford is sort of wishing for a
divorce to some extent, but the fact is that divorce in the long
haul probably isn't going to impact these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``UCSF Stanford Health Care's president and CEO, Peter Van
Etten, still insists that the merger will prove worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 20 months into this. Nobody said it would be easy.
Nobody said it would be quick,'' Van Etten said. ``I continue to
believe that the two organizations are much more able to deal with
our core problem, which is the changing external environment, by
continuing to operate as a merged entity.'
</P>
<P>
   UCSF Stanford financial woes are due in large part to federal
budget cuts that have sharply reduced payments to academic medical
centers everywhere. Those cuts were expected and were a key
justification for merging.
</P>
<P>
   Van Etten said the revenue shortfalls simply came faster than
expected, and UCSF Stanford failed to act quickly enough to cut the
staff and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   He also admitted that officials should not have hired as many
people as they did. Half of the new hires were in patient care,
partly a result of increased business at the hospitals. Most of the
rest were in finance and computer technology, to put in place
expensive but crucial upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   The organization spends $150,000 a month renting executive
offices near Candlestick Park, considered neutral ground between
the two institutions. Officials defend the expense, saying several
employees formerly located at both campuses have moved there,
freeing needed space.
</P>
<P>
   But many question whether projected savings from the merger were
ever realistic. Faculty members at both campuses also have
expressed doubts about management, and some have called for top
executives to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't clear to me that good administration wouldn't cure
this whole problem,'' Melmon said.

   SCI-BLACK-HOLES (Undated) _ The sudden, random and faraway
flashes of gamma radiation, known as gamma ray bursts, seem to be
cosmic birth announcements of a phenomenon of awesome power, one
predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity but shrouded
in mystery because no light can escape the dark clutches of its
consuming gravity. If current hypotheses are correct, Dr. Tsvi
Piran of Columbia University said at a recent four-day symposium at
the Space Telescope Science Institute, ``each gamma ray burst is
signaling the creation of a new black hole.'' By John Noble
Wilford. (1975 words)

   SCI-WEIGHT-FAT (Undated) _ For three decades now, Americans have
been bombarded with advice to eat less fat for the sake of their
hearts and their waistlines. But now a growing number of nutrition,
health and obesity specialists maintain that in trying to squeeze
some of the heart-damaging grease from our high-fat diets, they
have sent Americans the wrong message. It's not fat per se that's
the problem, the experts now say, but the kinds of fats Americans
eat and the other kinds of foods they fill up on when they cut back
on appetite-satisfying fat. By Jane E. Brody. (1900 words)

   SCI-RESEARCH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Duke's recent problems with a
Federal review board illuminates the increasing stresses on that
hospital and university review boards face and the new
aggressiveness by the Federal agency that oversees them, the Office
of Protection from Research Risks. The review boards, which check
the safety and efficacy of experiments on humans, generally work on
their own time with little or no staff and virtually no training.

   SCI-SMALLPOX (Undated) _ The Doctor's World: Smallpox, an
ancient disease, was eradicated 20 years ago. Smallpox, the virus,
is on death row, frozen in two highly protected laboratories in the
United States and Russia. Like lawyers filing last minute briefs,
American scientists recently found new arguments for public health
research requiring use of the virus in future laboratory
experiments. Last week, with the U.S. and Russia reversing earlier
decisions to destroy the smallpox virus, the World Health
Organization granted the virus yet another stay. It is good for at
least three years beyond the June 30 date that had been set for its
destruction in ovens. By Lawrence K. Altman Jr. (1750 words)

<P>
   SCI-FLAG-PRESERVE (Undated) _ Using technology as new as space
age fabrics and as ordinary as the chemicals from the corner
dry-cleaning shop, scientists and historians here have taken on the
job of cleaning and preserving the Star-Spangled Banner, the flag
that flew over Fort McHenry in Baltimore in 1814, so that it might
last at least another 185 years. By Irvin Molotsky. (1100 words)

   SCI-WEIGHT-MORPH (Undated) _ The software in a body morphing
machine shows users what they might look like if they lost 15
percent of their weight or, show a 30 percent gain. Then it tells
details users' chances of contracting various weight-related
maladies _ heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure _ worsen
and improve with the changes. By Eric Nagourney. (425 words)

   SCI-ONLINE-FITNESS (Undated) _ On-line training: The Internet is
awash with gymnasts and fitness competitors, body builders, coaches
and trainers willing to sign up clients for online fitness. The
system has its advantages, including the anonymity. This writer
emerged 17 pounds lighter, capable of sleeping through the night
for the first time in her life, energetic, fit and strong. By
Marion Roach. (1375 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: In the early '70s,
celebrity dieters and wishful thinkers propelled Dr. Robert C.
Atkins's self-styled ``diet revolution'' into a national phenomenon
that sent shivers of despair through the promoters of sound
nutrition and public health. Despite warnings of a possible heart
attack on every page, ``Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution,'' a book that
promoted a high-fat, high-protein diet and spurned all
carbohydrates, was bought by 10 million Americans whose growing
reliance on labor-saving devices and fast foods had spawned thunder
thighs and rendered their waistlines obsolete. But the Atkins
scheme was neither new nor revolutionary then and is really no
different from his ``new diet revolution,'' published in 1992 and
now enjoying a resurgence of popularity among countless
weight-conscious women and carnivorous men seeking a quick and
painless route to a slimmer summer. By Jane E. Brody. (1450 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WEIGHT-PILLS (Undated) _ In their eagerness to take pills
that will help them slim down, people may conveniently overlook
something that doctors remember all too well: weight-loss drugs
have had an alarming history. By Denise Grady. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WEIGHT-REBOUND (Undated) _ It is a depressing article of
faith among the overweight and the professionals who treat them
that 95 percent of people who lose weight regain it _ and sometimes
more _ within a few months or years. That statistic has been quoted
widely over the last four decades, from Congressional hearings to
diet books to research papers and seminars. And it is the reason so
many people approach dieting with a sense of hopelessness. But
there is a problem with that piece of conventional wisdom: There is
no scientific basis for it. In fact, obesity researchers say that
no one has an accurate idea of what percentage of the population
can maintain a weight loss over the long term. By Jane Fritsch.

   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health and fitness:

<P>
   _ Though it has been well established that most peptic ulcers
are caused by a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori,
and can be effectively treated with antibiotics, recent studies
show that that information has not gotten out to ulcer sufferers,
and a large number of doctors were continuing to treat with
standard acid blockers only. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Many teen-agers experience stress, but the patterns of stress

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the early 1970s, the heyday of mini-skirts and quick
weight-loss schemes, when fashion magazines and celebrity dieters
propelled Dr. Robert C. Atkins' ``diet revolution'' into a national
phenomenon. His book, ``Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution,'' promoted a
high-fat, high-protein diet spurning most carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   Many nutritionists and public health experts were dismayed, but
10 million Americans were undeterred. Their reliance on
labor-saving devices and fast foods had spawned thunder thighs and
rendered their waistlines a thing of the past. They made the book a
best seller.
</P>
<P>
   But the Atkins scheme was neither new nor revolutionary then or
in 1992 when he published his ``new diet revolution'' _ now
enjoying a resurgence of popularity among weight-conscious,
meat-loving men and women seeking a quick route to a slimmer
summer. More than five million copies of the paperback version are
in print, and it was just ranked the second-leading best seller
over the last five years by USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   The basic diet Atkins advocated was first promulgated in the
1860s by William Banting, an English casket maker whose
best-selling book, ``Letter on Corpulence,'' outlined a
low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet. It became so popular that his
countrymen began using ``banting'' as a synonym for losing weight,
notes Laura Fraser in ``Losing It: False Hopes and Fat Profits in
the Diet Industry'' (Plume, $13.95).
</P>
<P>
   There were many spinoffs _ among them, Dr. Alfred Pennington's
1940s low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, Dr. Herman Taller's 1961
``Calories Don't Count'' high-fat, high-protein, low-carbohydrate
diet and Dr. Irwin Stillman's strictly carnivorous ``The Doctor's
Quick Weight-Loss Diet,'' which allowed only lean meat, poultry,
eggs and low-fat cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   Having been raised on shredded wheat, oatmeal, challah, Jewish
rye and bagels, I was not one to be seduced by such schemes.
Whenever I stop eating bagels, I dream about them. And by the time
the Atkins diet surfaced, I had already shed 35 pounds and found my
way to a permanent size 4 or 6 through sensible eating with
occasional splurges and regular exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Others I knew who succumbed to the high-fat program were less
than enthralled with the results. One colleague's cholesterol level
soared to over 700 milligrams after four weeks on the Atkins plan,
and her doctor threatened to hospitalize her if she did not go off
it immediately. Another woman told me: ``No wonder you lose weight
on this diet. I'm nauseous practically all the time.'' A third
abandoned the diet when she became so weak she could hardly do her
work, let alone exercise. A fourth lost 12 pounds in a month, but
although he loves meat, he soon got fed up with the diet (``what's
a cheeseburger without a bun?'') and has since gained it back.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no published study showing long-term success with
the Atkins scheme. In an interview, Atkins said, ``No one has ever
done a study of long-term results. There has never been anyone
willing or able to fund a study.'' He said his Center for
Complementary Medicine would soon underwrite a study of 50 healthy,
obese people to be conducted by a Duke University researcher who
will assess the diet's effects on cholesterol and other blood
lipids.
</P>
<P>
   Despite any documentation of the diet's long-term results or
safety, it now seems as if every third person is trying the ``new''
diet, having heard of people who shed 10, 20 or even 40 pounds
eating all the steak, eggs, cheese, butter and cream they wanted.
Since fat is the most fattening, it is reasonable to ask how a
person can lose weight eating so many high-fat foods.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is simple. You can lose weight on any diet that
restricts the kinds or amounts of foods you can eat or the
frequency with which you eat them. The Atkins diet does not allow
bread, cake, ice cream, candy and cookies, or potatoes, rice,
pasta, cereals, grains, milk, yogurt, fruits and many vegetables.
For the first two weeks you can eat no more than 20 grams of
carbohydrates a day _ the amount in two-thirds of a small bagel
 &UR; or &LR;  half a cup of rice  &UR; or &LR;  12 ounces of fat-free yogurt. Because
carbohydrates hold water in the body, as your body becomes depleted
of stored carbohydrates, the first five pounds or so you lose on
this plan is not fat weight but water, quickly regained with the
first starchy food eaten.
</P>
<P>
   The strict two-week ``induction'' diet is followed by an
``ongoing weight loss'' diet that includes slightly more vegetables
and a few fruits like strawberries (with cream, of course), but
still no starchy foods, milk or yogurt. The entire plan capitalizes
on two facts:
</P>
<P>
   -Because fats are digested more slowly than carbohydrates,
dieters do not get as hungry between meals.
</P>
<P>
   -Few people can eat endless amounts of animal protein and fat
for weeks on end and so they eat less and less.
</P>
<P>
   If you eat less than you did before going on a diet, you will
lose weight regardless of the diet.
</P>
<P>
   The Atkins plan suffers from the same limits that afflict every
diet that rquires people to eat in peculiar ways: a diet is
something people go on to go off, and when they go off a diet, they
often regain the weight they lost and then some.
</P>
<P>
   The late Dr. Jean Mayer, a noted nutritionist and former
president of Tufts University, called the syndrome ``the rhythm
method of girth control.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atkins plan strives to put dieters into an abnormal
metabolic state called ketosis, which occurs when the body burns
fats for fuel in the absence of carbohydrates. Substances called
ketones accumulate in the blood, and can cause bad breath,
constipation, nausea and lightheadedness. Furthermore, in trying to
get rid of ketones, the body excretes sodium and potassium, and
that can result in dehydration and abnormal heart rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   The diet is seriously short of essential nutrients, especially
calcium (and its excess of protein causes the body to lose what
little calcium it gets), vitamins C and D and folic acid. To combat
the problem, Atkins recommends supplements, although not including
a significant amount of calcium.
</P>
<P>
   You may also wonder whether it is safe to be on a diet that is
riddled with saturated fats and cholesterol and nearly devoid of
the fruits, vegetables and whole grains, which have been shown to
be vital to good health. Dr. Kevin Vigilante, a public health
specialist, and Dr. Mary Flynn, a nutritionist, both of Brown
University, summed up the prevailing view in their new book
``Low-Fat Lies, High-Fat Frauds, and the Healthiest Diet in the
World'' (LifeLine Press, $19.95). They wrote, ``The Atkins diet is
potentially so dangerous that the surgeon general should probably
put a warning on every book Dr. Robert Atkins sells. The diet's
only salvation is that people can't tolerate it for very long _ not
long enough for the increase in the risk of heart disease or cancer
that long-term use of such a diet could bring.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other currently popular schemes _ the ``Zone'' diet and the
``Sugar Busters'' diet _ are also hard on carbohydrates but less
rigid than the Atkins plan. Dr. Barry Sears, a biotechnologist who
wrote ``Enter the Zone'' (Harper Collins $22), rightly includes
just enough carbohydrates in his diet to avoid ketosis.
</P>
<P>
   But the theory behind the Zone diet _ that insulin insensitivity
is the cause of obesity when people eat a diet relatively rich in
starchy foods and sugars _ has been found wanting by biochemists,
who point out that it is obesity that causes insulin insensitivity,
not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that no matter what people eat, it is calories
that ultimately count. Eat more calories than your body uses and
you will gain weight. Eat fewer calories and you will lose weight.
The body, which is after all nothing more than a biochemical
machine, knows no other arithmetic.

DRUG WHOLESALER FACES RAFT OF LAWSUITS OVER ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Barely one month after McKesson HBOC Inc.
admitted to improperly recording its revenue, the San Francisco
company is fighting off a barrage of lawsuits, allegations of
financial fraud and questions from federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson, the nation's largest drug wholesaler, shocked
investors April 28 when it said a year-end audit found $42 million
in sales that were improperly recorded by HBOC, a health care
software company in Atlanta that McKesson bought in January.
</P>
<P>
   In its bombshell announcement, McKesson said the accounting mess
would force the company to restate its earnings over the past four
quarters and lower its profit outlook for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news crushed McKesson's healthy stock, which plunged 50
percent to $35. Within hours, the Fortune 100 company lost $9
billion in stock market value _ one of the most devastating one-
day losses for a company in Wall Street history.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, dozens of shareholders have filed lawsuits in
federal court in San Francisco and San Jose against McKesson.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action suits allege that top executives knowingly or
recklessly manipulated the company's finances and software sales
figures.
</P>
<P>
   One suit charged that McKesson Chairman Charles McCall, the
former chief executive of HBOC, and McKesson director Jay
Gilbertson, HBOC's former president and chief financial officer,
schemed to ``deceive the investing public'' by inflating revenue
figures. That led to the artificial boosting of HBOC's stock price
before McKesson bought the company, the suit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Because the merger was a $14 billion stock transaction, the two
shareholders ``had a motive to misstate the company's financial
results,'' says the lawsuit filed by attorney Justice Reed of
Schubert &AMP; Reed in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In November, shortly after the deal was announced, McCall owned
4.6 million shares of HBOC stock and held options on 3.6 million
HBOC shares that could be cashed in when the merger was completed,
according to the lawsuit. Also in November, Gilbertson bought
384,000 HBOC shares to be exercised as stock options, the suit
says.
</P>
<P>
   Several securities attorneys said the legal storm for McKesson
will worsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, the accounting shenanigans are rising to the
level of securities fraud,'' said William Audet, a San Jose lawyer
who represents investors in one lawsuit. ``When they admit they
`improperly recorded' revenue, those are industry buzzwords for
``Oops, we screwed up, and someone may have been cooking the
books.'''
</P>
<P>
   McKesson executives declined to comment on the fraud
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson _ founded as a drugstore in New York City in 1833 _
also faces the scrutiny of regulators. The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission recently contacted the company to discuss the
accounting problems, a McKesson executive confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received inquiries, and we're responding to their
questions,'' said Larry Kurtz, vice president of corporate
communications for McKesson.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz would not confirm or deny the precise details of the SEC's
inquiry. But legal and government sources close to the SEC said
that regulators have met with attorneys from Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher &AMP; Flom, the high-powered New York law firm that represents
McKesson.
</P>
<P>
   The sources, who requested anonymity, said the SEC asked for
corporate financial papers, merger documents from McKesson's
acquisition of HBOC, audits of HBOC by Arthur Andersen &AMP; Co. and
audits of McKesson by Deloitte &AMP; Touche LLP.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Pacific Exchange in San Francisco is
investigating the options trading in McKesson stock during the
weeks prior to the McKesson/HBOC merger, said Dale Carlson, a
Pacific Exchange spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, McKesson is conducting its own investigation.
The company has hired Skadden Arps and forensic accountants at
PricewaterhouseCoopers to go over its books and accounting
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson hopes its internal investigation will be done by June,
but it could easily stretch beyond that date, Kurtz said.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a lot to shake McKesson. The corporate behemoth
posted $31 billion in sales last year and employs 20,000 people
worldwide. The company does business with thousands of hospitals,
pharmacies, doctors' groups and medical manufacturers.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be few danger signs in the deal McKesson-HBOC
deal. Wall Street analysts were high on McKesson's earnings outlook
and stock performance.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson had enjoyed several strong fiscal quarters. McKesson's
financial adviser, Bear Stearns, and HBOC's advisers, Morgan
Stanley and Arthur Andersen, all signed off on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in our due diligence for the merger suggested there
were any problems,'' Kurtz said. ``We were assisted by investment
bankers, accountants and legal counsel, and we were satisfied the
due diligence we conducted was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one research firm, though, flagged problems at HBOC
well before the merger. The Center for Financial Research &AMP;
Analysis Inc. in Rockville, Md., warned investors in 1998 and 1997
that HBOC was using a legal but risky accounting method of posting
cash receipts from customers before HBOC actually got paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were booking revenue on software sales when they hadn't
collected the cash yet,'' said Christopher Teeters, the center
analyst who followed HBOC. ``And they were getting more and more
aggressive at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and securities lawyers also said that McKesson had been
dying to make a big acquisition that would strengthen its dominant
position in the health care services field. And HBOC, a
fast-growing software vendor and a high-flying stock on Wall
Street, seemed to fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``McKesson is a pretty conservative company with a sound
reputation, and they acquired a company in the health care software
industry, where there's a lot of fast and loose accounting,'' Reed
said. ``It's a cultural clash, and it really blew up in their
faces.''

VIRGIN CHAIRMAN INTRODUCES ONLINE SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a contortionist, trapeze, spotlights,
magician, performing Seal (the musician, not the marine mammal) and
one quite prominent ringmaster in Richard Branson, the recent
Virgin Megastore Online kickoff party in Hollywood had all the
trappings of a circus.
</P>
<P>
   But it'll take more than an entertaining opening act to keep
them coming back to this show.
</P>
<P>
   Branson, the flamboyant Virgin founder, has been slow to the
online world, and coy about why: ``We were (Internet) virgins, and
virgins have to be courted a little longer than those who are not
virgins.''
</P>
<P>
   Branson has ambitious plans for the site (at www.virginmega.com,
though it will soon go to www.virgin.com). He wants to overlay a
massive selection of music, videos, books and video games with
recommendations from store employees, music samples, streamed audio
spun by store disc jockeys, streamed concert video, pop-culture
news and discussion areas.
</P>
<P>
   The initial verdict: It needs work.
</P>
<P>
   The site's size makes navigation important, but what it has is
unsatisfactory, with too few ways to burrow through the
information. And its reliability is dubious.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I randomly clicked on one top-seller, the latest
by funky Icelandic music collective Gus Gus. What I got were albums
by a different band, called Gus.
</P>
<P>
   An honest mistake, and maybe even a useful feature when you
don't quite know the name of the band you're seeking. But I want to
know more about Gus Gus and can't find it here. Nor can I find
anything else the band has done, despite a well-received previous
album.
</P>
<P>
   If Branson wants to outcompete Amazon.com, and he does, he'll
have to make people want to hang around and buy something. Amazon
does that well, loading its site with tons of information about
books of all genres, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin's Gus Gus boo boo (or is that just a Gus boo?) implies a
site that makes it harder, not easier to shop, which won't exactly
stick customers to your site.
</P>
<P>
   Branson does have some advantages: Unlike Amazon, he won't have
to lose hundreds of millions of dollars to establish a brand name.
</P>
<P>
   By plastering the site's URL on Virgin airplanes, cola, record
stores, cruise ships, record labels and everything else, he's
betting on a cross-pollinating marketing effort that will bring
customers in from all directions, and send them back out into all
things Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   That model, of course, is closer to what a company such as the
Walt Disney Co. is doing with its online site, where entertainment
and e-commerce sits on the same home page with the travel services
and theme park info.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that seems right,'' Branson said of the Disney
comparison. ``There's only a few names like Virgin and Microsoft
and Disney out there. I actually believe the megastores and the
Internet can work well together.''
</P>
<P>
   With time, Virgin Megastores Online might yet become the
Greatest Show on the Internet, rather than just a sideshow act. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GET OFF ON THIS FLOOR
</P>
<P>
   Like movie premieres but can't stand waiting for hours to see
the limos roll up? Columbia TriStar Interactive has a novel
alternative, with what it's billing as the first-ever virtual movie
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   The company is using the 3-D chat program from Activeworlds.com
to host the digital debut for the upcoming ``The Thirteenth
Floor,'' a sci-fi thriller about a virtual world set in a
building's nonexistent 13th floor.
</P>
<P>
   To take part, you'll need to crawl over to
www.thethirteenthfloor.com to get the Active Worlds chat client
software and install it before the event starts at 6 p.m. Monday.
That evening, click on the Active Worlds browser's option for ``The
Thirteenth Floor'' premiere, where you'll be taken to what looks
like a theater entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Choose your on-screen ``avatar,'' or digital representation, and
watch as avatars of the film's stars (Gretchen Mol, Vincent
D'Onofrio, Craig Bierko and Dennis Haysbert) and producers (Roland
Emmerich and Dean Devlin) field questions from avatars of media
people from around the country. In real life, the stars will be
stationed at Columbia TriStar offices in Los Angeles and New York,
responding to queries by computer.
</P>
<P>
   A moderator also will pass along fan questions. After the
celebrities come through the press line, everyone will be asked
into the ``theater,'' which will show the movie's trailer and TV
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   If this catches on, the catering business in Hollywood will be
on the brink of bankruptcy by 2001. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ANIME FOREVER
</P>
<P>
   Being an anime fan in America can be trying for those who
actually want to see cool Japanese animation regularly. Thank
goodness for the Cartoon Network, then, which is feeding your anime
jones all week with marathons of ``Sailor Moon'' and ``Dragon Ball
Z.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 11:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. Sunday, the channel will show the
final 17 episodes of ``Sailor Moon,'' which follows the fanciful
exploits of a teen princess who joins other young women to fight
the evil Queen Beryl and her Negaverse minions. The episodes have
never been shown on U.S. television, network officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of next week, the network will show two hours of
episodes daily from ``Dragon Ball Z,'' which follows a small band
of crusaders who can summon dragons to help them fight evil
adversaries. The shows will run from 4 to 6 p.m. Monday through
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The channel also will run four hours of ``Dragon Ball Z'' movies
_ ``The Tree of Might,'' ``The World's Strongest'' and ``Dead Zone
Vortex'' _ beginning at noon next Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Now hear this: avocados, walnuts, salad dressings with oil,
sauteed vegetables, fatty fish and some kinds of margarine may be
back on the menu for health-conscious Americans, even for those
trying to lose weight, if the findings of recent studies are to be
believed.
</P>
<P>
   For three decades now, Americans have been bombarded with advice
to eat less fat for the sake of their hearts and their waistlines.
One well-known expert, Dr. Dean Ornish, advocates stripping away
all added fats and naturally fatty foods to achieve a diet
containing no more than 10 percent of calories from fat, down from
the 44 percent typically consumed by Americans in the 1960s and the
34 percent now consumed.
</P>
<P>
   But now a growing number of nutrition, health and obesity
specialists maintain that in trying to squeeze some of the
heart-damaging grease from our high-fat diets, they have sent
Americans the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   It's not fat per se that's the problem, the experts now say, but
the kinds of fats Americans eat and the other kinds of foods they
fill up on when they cut back on appetite-satisfying fat. For while
heart disease has indeed declined as many Americans shun
artery-clogging saturated fats and cholesterol, waistlines have
expanded significantly and obesity has risen by 50 percent since
the big push to limit fat took off in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The very tactic viewed as the key to weight control _ stripping
the diet of fat _ seems to have backfired. Food companies responded
to fat phobia with a plethora of fat-free, low-fat and reduced-fat
products, especially the dessert and snack foods that Americans
covet.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an overdose of carbohydrates, ranging from
fat-free pretzels, crackers, cookies, cakes and frozen desserts to
dinner plates piled high with pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Many obesity specialists, as well as popular diet advocates like
Dr. Robert Atkins and Barry Sears, say these carbohydrates are the
cause of the growing American girth. Even the potato, which once
proclaimed ``I am not fattening'' in award-winning ads, now heads
the hit list being circulated by carbohydrate bashers, some of
whom, like Atkins, go to the opposite extreme by recommending that
people can lose weight by eating all the fat they want as long as
they eat few or no carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swing back to Atkins is a response to the fact that a
low-fat diet hasn't worked for a lot of people because they stuff
in carbohydrates,'' said Dr. Margo Denke, an associate professor of
medicine and endocrinology at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alice H. Lichtenstein, a professor of nutrition at Tufts
University in Boston, agrees that ``the low-fat pendulum swung too
far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People assumed that if a food had no fat, they could eat as
much of it as they wanted,'' she said. ``But many low-fat and
fat-free products have nearly as many calories as their full-fat
versions. Reducing fat alone is no guarantee of weight loss. You
must cut calories or increase physical activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Denke said, ``No matter what anyone tells you, it's calories
that count. Carefully controlled metabolic studies show that it
doesn't matter where extra calories come from. Eat more calories
than you expend and you'll gain weight.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is just what Americans have been doing: gaining weight
on fat-free and low-fat foods consumed without regard to their
caloric content. Instead of replacing some of the less desirable
high-fat foods with nutrient-rich but low-calorie fruits and
vegetables, they are filling up on foods loaded with added sugars
and refined starches that have little to offer nutritionally
besides calories, the experts lament.
</P>
<P>
   ``In making food choices, we must learn to eat foods that are
nutritionally robust _ fruits, vegetables, legumes,'' said Dr.
Robert H. Eckel, chairman of the American Heart Association's
nutrition committee and professor of medicine and physiology at the
University of Colorado. ``There is strong evidence that these kinds
of foods help to reduce disease, not just heart disease but also
cancer, diabetes, hypertension and obesity.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey of American consumers, however, conducted in 1997 by
the Food Marketing Institute, revealed that 56 percent of shoppers
who had changed their diets did so by trying to cut down on the
amount of fat they consumed, but only 15 percent said they were
trying to eat more fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Even people with high cholesterol levels may not need to go to
fat-reduction extremes to protect their hearts. A study of 444 men
with high LDL cholesterol conducted by Dr. Robert H. Knopp and
colleagues at the University of Washington in Seattle showed that
reducing total fat to 30 percent of calories from 35 percent and
keeping saturated fats at 7 percent to 8 percent was as effective
in lowering cholesterol as diets with less total fat.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when fat intake dropped to about 20 percent of
calories, heart-protective HDL cholesterol levels fell and
heart-damaging triglyceride levels rose. Study participants had no
difficulty sticking to a 30 percent fat diet, whereas more
stringent diets require a dedication that most Americans lack.
</P>
<P>
   There is also growing evidence that regardless of what else it
may contain, a weight-loss diet devoid of fat may be
counterproductive, leaving dieters perpetually hungry or
unsatisfied and susceptible to overeating when their resolve fails.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary Flynn, a nutritionist affiliated with Brown University,
addresses this issue in a new book written with Dr. Kevin
Vigilante, also of Brown, ``Low-Fat Lies, High-Fat Frauds''
(LifeLine Press, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``A little fat helps you lose weight,'' the book notes. ``Fat
makes food taste good, and it makes you feel full. Taste is vital
to the success of any diet. Without a little fat you're always
going to be hungry. The key is to eat the right kind of fat, in the
right amounts. You need a diet you can live with.''
</P>
<P>
   A study of 12 obese boys published in March in the journal
Pediatrics showed that meals with refined carbohydrates and little
fat were less effective in staving off hunger than fattier meals
with the same caloric content. Dr. David Ludwig of Harvard Medical
School and Children's Hospital in Boston concluded from these
findings that substituting processed grains like cereals, bread and
pasta for dietary fat may be making Americans fatter.
</P>
<P>
   Fat in the diet also seems to play a psychological role that
helps some people keep their caloric intake in check. In a study at
Pennsylvania State University, normal-weight women given yogurts
with various fat contents ate more at the next meal if they were
told the yogurt was fat-free than if they thought they had eaten a
high-fat yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, people given fat-free potato chips ate less fat than
those given regular chips, but over the course of a day, both
groups consumed the same number of calories.
</P>
<P>
   Next fall, Eckel said, the heart association is expected to
issue revised dietary guidelines that will de-emphasize fat as a
percent of calories in the diet, except as it figures in obesity,
but will continue to recommend upper limits on saturated fats. For
the last two decades, the association has recommended that healthy
people limit their fat intake to 30 percent of calories, with
saturated fat _ the kind that is hard at room temperature _ no more
than 10 percent, polyunsaturates less than 10 percent and the rest
from monounsaturates, which are plentiful in olive and canola oils
and avocados.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the current American eating pattern, it's probably wise
to stay at a maximum of 30 percent of calories from fat,''
Lichtenstein said. ``If we go above that, Americans tend to
increase their consumption of saturated fats in meats. Maybe if we
adopted a Mediterranean diet _ rich in vegetables and fish and
olive oil _ we could go higher than 30 percent fat without
compromising our health, but it's important to remember that the
Mediterraneans' low rate of heart disease is not just the result of
a diet rich in olive oil. It's a life style that is far more active
than ours and that doesn't contain all the bizarre foods we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Extreme reductions in dietary fat can deprive the body of vital
nutrients that play a crucial role in health. Dietary fat
transports the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. Unsaturated fat
from vegetable and seafood sources supplies the body with essential
fatty acids needed to produce nerve cells and hormones.
</P>
<P>
   There is also growing evidence that unsaturated fatty acids help
protect people from serious diseases. For example, studies in
Spain, Italy, Greece, Sweden and the United States linked diets
rich in olive oil to a reduced risk of breast cancer. The brain,
too, may benefit from monounsaturates like olive oil. A study
published this month in the journal Neurology by Italian
researchers found that a high intake of extra-virgin olive oil was
associated with preservation of cognitive functions in healthy
elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing Nurses Health Study revealed that among 80,000 women
initially aged 34 to 59, total fat consumption did not affect
coronary risk, but the kinds of fats the women ate did. Each 5
percent increase in calories from saturated fats (primarily from
meats and dairy products) raised their risk of coronary disease by
17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   An even greater risk was posed by trans fatty acids, which are
formed when unsaturated vegetable oils are hydrogenated to make
them solid at room temperature, for example, to form margarine.
Each 2 percent increase in trans fat calories raised the women's
coronary risk by 93 percent. A number of margarines free of harmful
trans fat are now available.
</P>
<P>
   Polyunsaturates and particularly omega-3 fatty acids like fish
oils, on the other hand, appear to protect against heart disease,
especially sudden cardiac death. Fish oils have been shown to
reduce the risk of blood clots and abnormal heart rhythms and
improve blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
</P>
<P>
   Studies in the Netherlands and in the United States have
indicated that eating just two fish meals, or seven ounces of fish,
a week can reduce a man's risk of heart attack by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of omega-3 fatty acid called alpha-linolenic acid,
found prominently in canola oil, flaxseeds, soybean oil, walnuts
and many dark green leafy vegetables, also appears to offer strong
protection against sudden cardiac death, according to a new study
by Dr. Frank Hu and associates at Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Among 76,000 participants in the Nurses Health Study, those with
the highest intake of alpha-linolenic acid had up to a 50 percent
lower risk of fatal heart attacks when compared with women who
consumed the least amount of this fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who choose fat-free salad dressings are missing out on
this important fatty acid,'' Hu said. ``Fat has been perceived as
the enemy, but that's not true. Some fats are good, some fats are
bad. We should be substituting good fats for bad ones rather than
worrying about reducing the total amount of fat.''

   &UR; Outdated Views on Ulcers Hinder Cures &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Though it had been well established that most peptic ulcers were
caused by a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori, and
could be effectively treated with antibiotics, recent studies
showed that the information had not gotten out to ulcer sufferers
and that a large number of doctors were continuing to treat with
standard acid blockers only.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lack of awareness among physicians and consumers,''
Dr. Benjamin D. Gold, a professor at the Emory University School of
Medicine in Atlanta, said at the annual meeting of the American
Gastroenterological Association in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Dr. Gold and other researchers for the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention found that more than half the 5,436
adults surveyed believed that ulcers were caused by stress and not
by a curable infection. This belief, the study concluded, may deter
people from seeking proper medical care for peptic ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cindy R. Friedman, a researcher with the CDC, said that even
though most doctors knew that H. pylori caused most ulcers, they
continued to prescribe acid-blocking therapy for first-time
patients. In one study, only 25 percent of the doctors prescribed
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC estimates that about 10 percent of Americans suffer from
ulcers. Experts are not certain how H. pylori is spread. The
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
explains that the bacteria weakens the protective mucous coating of
the stomach and duodenum, and that weakening allows acid to get
through to the lining beneath. Both acid and the bacteria irritate
the lining and cause a sore or ulcer.
</P>
<P>
   Dull, gnawing pain is the most common symptom.
</P>
<P>
   More information on ulcers can be obtained from the CDC at (888)
698-5237.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What Stress Can Mean to Teen-Age Girls &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Many teen-agers experience stress, but the patterns of stress
girls encounter may leave them more vulnerable to depression than
those boys experience, according to a study that appears in the
current issue of the journal Child Development.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers interviewed 88 youths, ages 8 to 18, who were
receiving treatment at several mental health clinics in an effort
to link stressful experiences to depression. Their parents were
also interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gathered information regarding the events that caused
stress or problems in the children's lives over the last year,''
said Dr. Karen D. Rudolph, an assistant professor of psychology at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne and the lead author
of the study. ``We asked about peer and family relations, school
adjustment, health related problems and other stressful
circumstances. We then rated how stressful the events were.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that children between 13 and 18
experienced more stress than those between 8 and 12. Though boys
and girls experienced the same overall amount of stress, boys were
more likely to complain of stressful situations like doing poorly
in school, getting sick, moving to a new town, getting arrested for
stealing or other events unrelated to interpersonal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Girls, on the other hand, experienced most of their stress from
relationship problems, including fights with peers, siblings or
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls may have more intimate and close relationships than boys
do,'' Dr. Rudolph said. ``When something happens, it can be very
stressful and disruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final phase of the study, researchers interviewed the
children to see whether they were experiencing anxiety or
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Girls reported more symptoms of depression in response to stress
than boys did. Girls' symptoms included feeling sad, feeling like
crying and feeling alone. Some also felt that nobody loved them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adolescents are faced with a lot of challenges they aren't
faced with earlier in life,'' Dr. Rudolph said.``Girls may be
socialized into a more nurturing role and may be more likely to be
involved with problems in their families or close relationships
with friends. This can lead to depression when these roles are
disrupted.''

WHITE HOUSE PANEL URGES CITIES TO PREPARE FOR Y2K WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move to prepare cities and towns for the
century date change and potential computer glitches, President
Clinton's Council on Year 2000 Conversion launched a nationwide
campaign Monday aimed at government and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our greatest domestic risks for Year 2000-related failures are
at the local level,'' said John Koskinen, chairman of the council.
</P>
<P>
   Two communities, San Antonio and Clearwater, Fla., were cited as
examples of how business and government leaders can work to prevent
Year 2000, or Y2K, computer glitches that could affect utilities,
medical care and banking.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Barton, director of the Y2K compliance office with Frost
Bank in San Antonio, said the primary goal in that city's campaign
has been to build public trust that institutions and government are
prepared for potential problems on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts fear that computers and other devices
containing microchips programmed to recognize only the last two
digits of a year will fail or malfunction beginning year, when the
machines may assume it is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Barton was one of seven business leaders who participated in a
news conference urging communities to plan for the Year 2000
conversion with a tool kit and information that is available from
the council at 888-USA-4-Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``From power and phone companies to banks and water utilities,
Americans want to know how the important local services upon which
they rely may be affected by computers' ability to process the
century date change,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 national associations representing utility and
service providers are working with the council to help mid-sized
cities and smaller towns prepare for potential computer glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many communities, service providers have been working hard
to keep citizens informed of their progress and the work that
remains,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is not to cheerlead or create a false sense of
security,'' he added. ``Our goal is for participants to share
factual information about what's been done, what remains to be done
and what additional actions a community should take as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks and financial institutions appear prepared for Y2K
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, John Hawke Jr., the U.S. comptroller of the
currency, told the House Banking Committee that the banking
industry would come through the changes ``with flying colors.''
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the Year 2000 Readiness and Responsibility Act
to protect businesses from legal damages over any Y2K problems.
Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, backed by the computer industry and business
groups, would limit punitive damage awards to $250,000 and make
plaintiffs wait 90 days after a Y2K failure before a lawsuit can be
filed.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups oppose any legislation that would protect
businesses against legitimate Y2K claims.

HOME IMPROVEMENT CLOSES ITS DOORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
HOME IMPROVEMENT 
Starring: Tim Allen, Patricia Richardson, Richard Karn 
On: ABC 
Time: Tuesday at 8 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Why do you bug me during football?'' Tim Taylor asks wife Jill
in a flashback scene from Tuesday's ``Home Improvement'' finale.
``Did I bother you during childbirth?''
</P>
<P>
   A sensitive fella, Tim. In an age of neo, he was defiantly and
unrepentantly paleo, the kind of guy who, his wife once observed,
``thinks that PBS is something a woman gets once a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet though Tim was not what you would call a '90s guy, ``Home
Improvement'' was indisputably one of the most popular sitcoms of
this decade. Tim Taylor, the not-quite-handyman host of ``Tool
Time'' and father of three played by Tim Allen, became a kind of
Everydad for our time. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was because ``Home Improvement'' was one from the
heartland in an era when every other show seems to be set in
Manhattan or Los Angeles, or because Allen played Taylor as a guy
who usually managed to do the right thing by his family while also
remaining true to his Neanderthal essence. It also helped
enormously that Jill, played by Patricia Richardson, was so quick
with a field-leveling comeback. (Her rejoinder to the football
remark was ``No, but you bothered me during conception.'')
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute finale is chockablock with clips that remind us
that, within the formulaic limitations at which even Richardson
admits she chafed, ``Home Improvement'' could be as good as it
gets.
</P>
<P>
   It also flexed a lot of ratings muscle over the years: In fact,
in 1993, a certain NBC sitcom named ``Seinfeld'' moved to Thursday
nights after it proved unable to compete with ABC's ``Home
Improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   The clips are sandwiched around a final episode that poses some
questions: Will the family move to Indiana so Jill can take a great
new job? Will Al Borland (Richard Karn) go through with his
wedding? Will we finally get to see the face of Wilson (Earl
Hindman), next-door neighbor and dispenser of Zen-like wisdom to
the Taylors?
</P>
<P>
   After eight years during which ``Home Improvement'' won 10
People's Choice awards, many viewers may have trouble letting go,
but Richardson was more than ready to see it end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely the time,'' she said during a conference call
with TV critics. ``We had taken that family where it was going to
go. ... The writers were still finding things to write about, but
it was getting harder and harder.''
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent to viewers. Still, we never looked to ``Home
Improvement'' for cutting-edge, state-of-the-art comedy. It never
had the cachet of ``Frasier'' or ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   As the finale reminds us, the humor of ``Home Improvement'' was
broader. It painted in big, cartoony strokes that fit Allen's
outsize personality. We could laugh at his obsession with cars
(``I'm addicted to cars,'' Taylor confessed. ``I'm thinking of
checking into the Henry Ford Clinic''), the mishaps he caused on
``Tool Time'' with his misplaced confidence in his abilities, or
his mangling of the advice imparted by Wilson, the sage neighbor
whose face was always partly obscured by the backyard fence.
</P>
<P>
   The husband-wife scenes between Tim and Jill edged close to
emotional truth at times, as when Jill had a hysterectomy this
season, but the show was careful never to stray too far from its
laughs-first formula. ``Tim evolved over the years, but he can't
get too evolved or there's no more show,'' observed Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Improvement'' was among the most successful of the '90s
sitcoms based on the persona of a standup comedian, a genre that
also included ``Seinfeld,'' ``Roseanne,'' and ``The Drew Carey
Show.'' But in an era where ``edgy'' is the most coveted of
adjectives, ``Home Improvement'' was never that, which meant fewer
Emmy nominations and less critical approbation than it deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pigeonholed into a family entertainment,'' said
Richard Karn, who played Al Borland, Taylor's sidekick on ``Tool
Time.'' ``We were never taken seriously'' by the entertainment
industry. The upside, Karn said, is that ``There was definitely a
connection with the audience right away. They got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Richardson and Karn are disappointed by some aspects of
their experience on ``Home Improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson made it clear that she wishes Jill had had more room
to grow rather than remaining Tim's foil, and said she had to
constantly pressure the show's mostly male writers to give Jill her
due. Pointing to Helen Hunt on ``Mad About You,'' Richardson said:
``It became her show equally. That didn't happen in my case.'' But
she said there were also satisfying episodes, such as ``the
wonderful show where I was attracted to the other guy.''
</P>
<P>
   While emphasizing that she had ``a really good experience doing
the show'' and that it has ``given me many gifts,'' Richardson said
she wishes the show had been ``more real'' in depicting family
tensions, like ``Roseanne'' or ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' ``That
was what I wanted our show to be more of,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some have fretted that the end of ``Home Improvement'' signals
the demise of the family sitcom genre, but Richardson isn't buying.
She says family programs will continue to thrive if, like
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' their humorous takes on family life
are grounded in complicated reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad family shows are in trouble, and they should be,''
said Richardson. ``Shows that present family life as something like
vanilla are on their way out, because they're not what people know
family life is like and they're boring to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Karn said that Al's character development was shortchanged by
the show's writers. ``He really did become the whipping boy. It got
to the point where he was there for fat jokes and slams on his
mother,'' he said. ``I felt a strong need to keep the character's
dignity and rise above that if I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen was not available for an interview, but in January, he
told TV writers in Pasadena, Calif. he wanted to leave the show
while it was still popular and of high quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``When is it ever the right time to shut the door on something
that has this much love and care?'' said Allen. ``I watched Michael
Jordan, and I watched `Seinfeld,' and I realized there's just no
good time to move on. But it's our show, and this is when we want
to call it quits.''

DIET PILLS POPULAR DESPITE A TAINTED PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Pa.)   (af)  
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The weight-loss drug Xenical, approved last month, had barely
reached the market when Web sites selling the drug sprang up to tap
into the intense consumer demand that accompanies the debut of
anything marketed to make people lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   But in their eagerness for pills to help them slim down, people
may conveniently overlook something that doctors remember all too
well: weight-loss drugs in general have have a rather alarming
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very checkered past,'' said Dr. Steven Heymsfield,
deputy director of the obesity research center at St. Luke's
Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. Although Heymsfield does prescribe
weight-loss medications for some of his patients, he said, ``I
believe we should use these drugs judiciously. If you forget the
past you're doomed, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the popular drug combination known as fen-phen
was blamed for damaged heart valves, and two drugs that had been
part of it were taken off the market. (A third, the appetite
suppressant phentermine, is still available.)
</P>
<P>
   During the 1930s, about 100,000 Americans took a chemical,
dinitrophenol, which prevented food energy from being turned into
fat. ``The energy is just liberated as heat,'' Heymsfield said.
``You sort of become a firefly.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, dinitrophenol was poisonous, causing blindness
and even death.
</P>
<P>
   ``In days gone by, thyroid hormone was very common,'' said Dr.
Jules Hirsch, an obesity expert and senior physician at the
Rockefeller University Hospital in Manhattan. It boosted
metabolism, and made people lose weight. But the excess hormone
disrupted heart rhythm and caused muscle weakness. ``It became
discredited, as it should have been,'' Hirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Albert Stunkard, director emeritus of the weight and eating
disorders program at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
said, ``The first drugs that were used that turned out to be
effective were amphetamines.'' These stimulants, introduced in the
1950s, suppressed appetite and may have boosted metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were used, and then abused,'' Stunkard said. ``But
they're actually very effective, and you can lose a lot of weight.
Long, continued use had bad effects, however, like making people
paranoid. And when they stopped, they became depressed and regained
the weight. Congressional hearings on amphetamine abuse were held
in the 1960s, and after that you weren't allowed to use them for
weight loss.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the strangest weight loss crazes was human chorionic
gonadotropin, a hormone produced by pregnant women. During the
1960s, injections of the hormone were said to stimulate rapid
weight loss _ if they were combined with a strict, low-fat,
low-calorie diet. Some patients were also told that if they cheated
on the diet, the hormone would actually cause rapid weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a scam,'' said Heymsfield.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of past debacles, he said, weight loss drugs are
studied longer and tested more carefully, and doctors tend to have
more confidence in them. The only ones on the market besides
phentermine are Xenical and Meridia.
</P>
<P>
   Xenical, also called orlistat, blocks the intestine from
absorbing about 30 percent of the fat that a person eats, and
studies have shown that people who take it may lose from 5 percent
to 10 percent of their body weight in a year. Meridia, or
sibutramine, is an appetite suppressant approved in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Both drugs are supposed to be used along with a reduced-calorie
diet, and only by people who meet the technical definition of
obese, meaning that they weigh 30 percent more than they should, or
20 percent more, with complications like diabetes or high blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Both drugs have side effects. Meridia can raise blood pressure,
and Xenical can cause diarrhea or even fecal incontinence if a
person eats too much fat while taking it.
</P>
<P>
   But people still clamor for them, and Heymsfield said he
prescribes them if he cannot talk a patient out of the idea, or if
diet and exercise have simply not worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do help people under certain circumstances,'' he said.
But, he emphasized, the drugs do not work well without diet and
exercise, and researchers do not know whether people who are helped
by them will be able to keep the weight off in the long run.

FORMER CHILD STAR JOHNNY CRAWFORD HEADS  TIMELESS  ORCHESTRA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's as if you'd stepped back into another era.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen musicians with slicked-back hair, splendid in white
dinner jackets, are playing the bouncy dance music popular during
the tough years of the Depression, when the poor grew poorer and
the rich ... well, the rich continued to party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever see a dream walking? Well, I did,'' croons the
orchestra leader through a megaphone, wearing tails and top hat.
``Did you ever see a dream talking? Well, I did...''
</P>
<P>
   The pages slide off your mental calendar, just like the
flashbacks in those old black-and-white movies ... 1937 ... 1934
... 1928 ...
</P>
<P>
   You've fallen under the spell of former Mouseketeer, former
child actor Johnny Crawford, who in the past decade has become one
of the premier society crooners and orchestra leaders in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can play any kind of music the people who hire us want,''
said Crawford, 53, who seemingly carries an encyclopedia of musical
knowledge in his head. ``But my favorite is the music of the '20s
and '30s. It's music not everybody knows, but once they hear it,
they seem to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   They do, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Crawford's Dance Orchestra was chosen to evoke a 1923
atmosphere at the Regal Biltmore Hotel's 75th anniversary last
fall, then picked to give vintage glitter to Gov. Gray Davis'
inaugural ball in January.
</P>
<P>
   So sought-after for celebrity parties and benefits it's booked
six months in advance, his orchestra will play a Fourth of July
concert of between-the-wars music at the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art for the fourth year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The what-era-is-it uncertainty Crawford's music evokes is what
won the orchestra a featured spot in Sony-TriStar's ``The
Thirteenth Floor,'' a sci-fi adventure flick scheduled to hit
theaters Friday. In the film, directed by Josef Rusnak, a computer
guru time-travels back to 1937 via computer chip, then turns up
dead. It's up to his assistant to go back to that era to look for
clues to the murder.
</P>
<P>
   For the film, Rusnak used lots of digital manipulation to make
present-day Los Angeles look as it did in the late '30s. So getting
just the right music to evoke the era _ an elegant dance orchestra
playing at a ritzy hotel, a smaller swing group playing
down-and-dirty for a dance marathon _ added just the right
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get an almost-documentary-style atmosphere; that
was very crucial,'' Rusnak said. ``And Johnny is the most authentic
guy doing this music. It's like a time warp to listen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusnak said Crawford not only suggested the songs used in the
movie and provided the arrangements, but also offered
'30s-appropriate advice on everything from the demeanor of the
waiters and chorus girls to helping choose authentic period dancers
for other scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me so much background information about the style of
the era, how people behaved,'' said Rusnak. ``He became a very dear
friend and adviser for me. I got an expert on this movie without
even knowing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Swing dancers can strut their stuff to Crawford's tunes on the
movie's soundtrack CD, which also will be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to sit still when Crawford's orchestra is playing,
said Bill Vestal, producer of the Fourth of July concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our audience gets very frustrated because there's no place for
them to dance,'' he said. ``But we're all dancing backstage.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a reaction Crawford relishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This music is so old, it's new,'' the orchestra leader said.
``It's fresh, it's happy, it's melodic and a lot of other things
that young people aren't used to hearing. When people hear it, they
want to dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love most when I'm conducting is turning around and
seeing the dance floor packed. That's what this music was written
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, whose grandfather was a Tin Pan Alley song plugger and
music publisher in the 1920s, said he was born with a love of
vintage music, but it took him a long time to parlay that interest
into a career.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take him long to get on stage, though. His father was
an actor at Columbia Studios, and both his parents were active in
community theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get on stage with them,'' Crawford recalls. ``I
loved the curtain calls, the people clapping.''
</P>
<P>
   He played a number of roles in movies and on TV, but fame really
began with a song.
</P>
<P>
   An imitation of tearful '50s crooner Johnny Ray won Crawford a
spot as one of the Mouseketeers on ``The Mickey Mouse Club'' in
1956. He left to take the role of young Mark McCain on ``The
Rifleman,'' a 1958-63 TV western.
</P>
<P>
   While he played roles in 15 movies and a dozen plays, he always
seemed to return to his first love: music and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   But because it was the early '60s, the time of the teen idol, he
became a singer. Signed by Del-Fi Records in 1961, he had hits with
``Cindy's Birthday,'' ``Rumors'' and ``Patti Ann.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Hollywood High School in 1964, he
continued to appear in shows ranging from ``Bonanza'' to ``The
Donna Reed Show.'' Armed with riding and roping skills learned on
``The Rifleman,'' he rode the professional rodeo circuit for two
years until he was drafted into the Army, where he spent two years
making training films. Discharged, he returned to acting and
continued his singing career between movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every once in a while, I'd pull out one of the old 78s and
listen to Al Jolson and Paul Whiteman,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   He met Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner, and, on his first
visit to the Playboy Mansion, discovered Hefner had a similar love
for old movie musicals and pre-big band music.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, there were these old, scratchy records of
dance bands from the 1920s playing,'' Crawford said. ``A light went
on in my head! It was like I had stumbled onto an abandoned gold
mine. I was so excited!''
</P>
<P>
   Another acquaintance suggested that he go to New York, where
band leader Vince Giordano needed a tenor to front for his
Nighthawks Orchestra. Crawford took the job and discovered a whole
new career, which included singing at President George Bush's
inaugural ball.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano played the same music Crawford had heard in all those
'30s musicals _ the same music for which his grandfather had left
him trunkfuls of arrangements. After two years in New York,
Crawford returned to Los Angeles in 1988, determined to form his
own orchestra and play the kind of music he loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the '40s music, which is a little too mellow,''
Crawford explained. ``It's syncopated, a little too exuberant.
Mellow bands really didn't want people to dance to their music;
they wanted people to sit and listen. But the bands that lasted
were dance bands.''
</P>
<P>
   He hoped others would fall in love with the music, too, but the
first people he had to win over were the musicians he auditioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them were used to playing `cool,' to improvising,'' he
said. ``They were afraid of being too corny. This music was corny,
but it was sincere. In those ('30s) days, musicians used to play
with more feeling, more style. I didn't want my guys to do it like
they were making fun of the music. I had to find musicians who
would play it like they meant it.''
</P>
<P>
   Every good dance band had a singer, and Crawford fills that
spot, as well as conducting and writing arrangements. His pleasant
tenor voice _ which occasionally dips into baritone range _ is a
perfect match for the music the band plays.
</P>
<P>
   On stage, the former child actor becomes a character again, an
amalgam of a handful of dapper leading men: part suave Fred
Astaire, a dash of ``Thin Man'' detective William Powell, a bit of
mammy singer Al Jolson, a soupcon of French romanceur Maurice
Chevalier.
</P>
<P>
   The character, and the orchestra, soon made a name for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Even charging $8,000 a night, Crawford found himself so in
demand he was turning down gigs. So, he began putting together
smaller groups for weddings, bar mitzvahs, retirement dinners and
other events, forming Johnny Crawford Music Inc. to act as a sort
of clearinghouse for bookings for local musicians. His wife,
Charlotte, helps run the business from their Hollywood Hills home.
</P>
<P>
   With a touch of gray at the temples but the same boyish grin,
Crawford's come a long way from a little kid wearing mouse ears.
And he sees no end in sight to his success, as long as people like
to dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so lucky to be doing this,'' he said with a wide grin.
``I got to know a period of music that comes from maybe the peak of
craftsmanship. And I'm actually making a living in show business in
a way that nobody else is. I've provided my own acting job, and it
just gets better and better.'' &UR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the 1960s, fans of the Beatles spent hours playing their
albums backward, destroying many a phonograph needle in an effort
to decipher messages supposedly recorded in reverse concerning Paul
McCartney's fate.
</P>
<P>
   New research shows, however, that backward speech does not have
to be unintelligible. Much as the brain can fill in missing words
in a half-heard sentence at a noisy cocktail party, it can also
make sense of reversed speech. If the Beatles had recorded ``Paul
is dead'' in a certain way, all those needles might have been
saved.
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, reported in a recent issue of Nature,
scientists at the California Institute of Technology and California
State University at Los Angeles took a recorded sentence, broke it
into equal short segments, and reversed each segment. They strung
all the reversed segments together and played the sentence to
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   When the segments were about 50 milliseconds in length, the
sentence was perfectly intelligible. As segments got longer,
however, intelligibility declined, approaching zero when they
reached 200 milliseconds.
</P>
<P>
   The research lends support to recent theories of how speech is
perceived. These theories hold that the brain does not rely so much
on analyzing the spectrum of short-term sounds as it does on
lower-frequency cues like intonation and modulation. As long as the
segments were short enough, the brain was still able to decipher
these cues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jupiter's Racing Winds &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The recent tornadoes that chewed up a swath of Oklahoma and
Kansas had wind speeds estimated to be greater than 300 miles per
hour. Horrifying as that is, it is fairly slow compared with what
is going on on Jupiter, where new observations show that winds of
molecular hydrogen ions are speeding around the poles at thousands
of miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Swirling around Jupiter is a huge sheet of electrically charged
gas and dust (mostly produced by volcanoes on the moon Io) that
extends outward about two million miles. This plasma sheet rotates
with the planet, like a filmy skirt on a spinning ice skater.
</P>
<P>
   Something must be coupling the sheet's rotation to that of the
planet. One theory holds that a kind of electromagnetic friction is
at work, as electric current flows through the plasma, along
Jupiter's magnetic field and across the polar auroras (which are
similar to the northern and southern lights on Earth, only far more
powerful). In this model, where the auroras meet Jupiter's upper
atmosphere, in oval patterns near the poles, ion winds known as
electrojets should be present.
</P>
<P>
   A team of researchers using a NASA infrared telescope in Hawaii
has now reported the existence of these electrojets, by measuring
the shifting wavelengths of molecular hydrogen (the shifts being an
indication that the ions are moving). The researchers, writing in
the journal Nature, reported that the average speed of the ions was
2.8 kilometers per second, or more than 6,000 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers note that friction between these winds and the
rest of Jupiter's atmosphere may help explain why the temperature
of the upper atmosphere is several hundred degrees higher than
would be explained by the effects of sunlight alone.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stormy Weather on Mars &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There has been some violent weather on Mars, too _ a huge
mid-summer cyclonic storm near the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope on
April 27, when Mars was in a close approach to Earth, just 54
million miles away. The storm system, four times the size of Texas,
resembled an earthly hurricane, with spiral water-ice clouds and an
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Most Martian storms are of the dust variety; moisture-laden
storms have rarely been observed, and the ones that had been seen,
notably during a Viking mission two decades ago, were much smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the Hubble photograph was taken, when the Mars
Global Surveyor spacecraft passed near the pole, the storm system
was gone, replaced by normal cloud patterns.

DELAYED MISSION TO DOCK SHUTTLE WITH SPACE STATION FOR FIRST TIME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shuttle astronauts blast off for the U.S.-led international
space station this week to dock with the fledgling outpost for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's 10-day mission will launch at 6:48 a.m. EDT Thursday
from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It was delayed a week
so hail damage to the shuttle's fuel tank could be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   The flight is the first to the unstaffed outpost since shuttle
astronauts joined the first two components, the Russian Zarya and
American Unity modules, last December. This mission was added to
station assembly plans a year ago and symbolizes the difficulties
that Russia's financial problems added to the six-year construction
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The station, at this stage of assembly, was never intended for a
shuttle docking.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's funding problems stalled production of the
station's 21-ton, 43-foot-long crew compartment. Known formally as
the Russian service module, the compartment is scheduled to be
launched in late November from Central Asia. It is 19 months behind
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The first resident crew initially was scheduled for May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   With launch date for the Russian module slipping last May, NASA
altered plans to wait until after the service module's arrival at
the new station to launch a shuttle supply mission.
</P>
<P>
   Station managers decided to add a shuttle flight ahead of the
crew compartment. The mission would lighten the cargo loads on
subsequent missions, allow visiting astronauts to make repairs and
use the shuttle's propulsion system to boost the station to a
higher altitude if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It also forced a major change in mission planning to permit a
shuttle docking without the massive service module and its more
sophisticated flight control systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the biggest deals we had to decide on this
flight, ... exactly how to attach the shuttle to the station,''
said NASA's Wayne Hale, the mission's lead flight director.
</P>
<P>
   On paper there were two options.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery crew could rendezvous with the new station, then
extend the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to grab the eight-story
outpost and position the docking mechanism on the Unity module for
a linkup. In December, shuttle astronauts caught up with the
previously launched Zarya module and used the robot arm to link it
with the Unity module.
</P>
<P>
   The second option was to adjust their procedures and dock
directly, relying on the less-sophisticated propulsion and flight
control systems of the Zarya module to hold the complex steady.
</P>
<P>
   Mission planners chose the latter option after an engineering
analysis revealed difficulties stabilizing the 68,000-pound Zarya
and Unity modules in the robot arm's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Several changes have been made in the flight control system
aboard Zarya as well as to the shuttle's rendezvous procedures.
</P>
<P>
   First, Russian engineers have developed a computer software
patch that will prevent Zarya's more powerful steering thrusters
from firing during the linkup. An inadvertent discharge by a large
jet during the initial docking operation could jolt Discovery out
of its berth.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Zarya module's low thrust jets, which will be
activated to hold the station in position for the docking, must be
quickly deactivated after the linkup with commands issued from a
Russian ground control station. The unfinished service module is
designed to handle that task automatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have analyzed this to death. It became clear very early
that the better way to approach this was to dock,'' said Hale.
``With the small thrusters we don't have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of rising slowly toward the station from below for the
docking, the shuttle crew will descend gradually toward the station
from several hundred feet above. The flight path was altered so
that the shuttle would not block antennas on the station awaiting
the crucial commands from the ground that will switch off Zarya's
thrusters after the docking.
</P>
<P>
   Timing will be crucial because of the need to execute the linkup
over a Russian ground station, a constraint shuttle pilots mastered
by docking nine times with Russia's Mir space station between 1995
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery commander Kent Rominger and co-pilot Rick Husband will
have four minutes to maneuver through the approach in order to dock
on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a very interesting rendezvous and docking,''
said Rominger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of our training is for the problems that could
occur. In some of our training, when we didn't dock, we bounced off
very late in the game,'' Rominger said of the elaborate ground
simulations involved in the preparations. ``Part of the reason is
that (Zarya) was never intended to be the motion control system to
support the docking. Knock on wood. I hope we won't have to use any
of that bounce off training,'' Rominger said.
</P>
<P>
   With Discovery docked, astronauts Tammy Jernigan and Dan Barry
will do a seven-hour spacewalk, primarily to install cranes on the
outside of the outpost. The hand-operated cranes will be used by
future station crews to move and install large storage batteries
and electronics boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts plan to move nearly two tons of cargo, including
laptop computers, printers, cameras, clothing, medical supplies,
oxygen canisters, drinking water and sound-dampening insulation
from Discovery to storage areas on the station. The gear will be
needed by the first resident crew expected to arrive early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Two high-priority repair efforts are planned as well.
</P>
<P>
   Working inside the Zarya module, the shuttle crew will replace
18 faulty ampere meters that are causing a half-dozen storage
batteries in the station's electrical power system to slowly
degrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery crew will also attempt to restore full use of a
U.S. satellite communications system that allows NASA mission
control teams to monitor station activities directly from mission
control facilities in Houston. A degradation in the signal was
detected in March.

KILLER SMALLPOX GETS A NEW LEASE ON LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: La., Ga., Mass., Calif.)   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smallpox, the ancient disease, was eradicated 20 years ago.
Smallpox, the virus, is on death row, frozen in two highly
protected laboratories in the United States and Russia. Like
lawyers filing last-minute briefs, American scientists have come up
with new arguments for reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, with the backing of Russia and other governments, the
World Health Organization formally bowed to their wishes and
granted the virus yet another stay. In keeping with action taken
last week, the United Nations subagency in Geneva said it would
appoint another committee to study the arguments and help decide
the virus' fate. It has now been put off until June 2002.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Geneva-based organization hopes, the committee may
have figured out whether there is any reason to keep stocks on
hand.
</P>
<P>
   For example, research using the virus might yield drugs against
the disease, or improved vaccines to prevent it. These would be of
no use, in effect, unless some rogue nation unleashed hidden stores
of smallpox virus in a biological terror attack, a prospect no
longer regarded as outlandish. Or use of new techniques might
decipher some of smallpox's distinctive features, providing clues
to help fight other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, such broad research goals would attract little
attention until they produced important findings. But there is
nothing ordinary about smallpox. It was one of the deadliest
scourges, killing one in three victims, peasants and monarchs
alike.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, known as variola, usually left survivors with deep,
pitting scars over the face and body, and often blinded them.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox was the first disease prevented by a vaccine, one
developed by Edward Jenner in 1798, and it was the first and only
disease to be wiped out, by the World Health Organization in 1979.
Variola only lives in people. After epidemiologists tracked down
every last case and focused vaccinations on areas where they
occurred, they broke the human-to-human chain of infection.
</P>
<P>
   The virus came to a dead end. Only the research stocks remained.
Few opposed the health organization's proposal that they be
destroyed, in what would be the first deliberate extinction of a
life form.
</P>
<P>
   But attitudes began to change in recent years when a shocked
world learned that Russia had secretly stockpiled tons of smallpox
virus and manipulated it for use as a possible weapon. During that
period, the former Soviet Union supporting the disease's
eradication. North Korea and other countries are believed to have
clandestine supplies of smallpox virus as well.
</P>
<P>
   Until Russia's duplicity and secret stores were exposed,
scientists elsewhere had virtually abandoned smallpox research
largely because the disease was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are the people most knowledgeable about smallpox and
presumably have the most at stake in the decision. Astonishingly,
with rare exception, scientists have had little to say about the
proposed action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense was that it was out of our hands, that it was a done
deal between WHO and the CDC,'' said Dr. Ronald Luftig of Louisiana
State University, referring to the World Health Organization and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Luftig
is an official of the American Society for Virology and American
Society for Microbiology, both of which officially support
destruction of variola.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential use of hidden stores of virus as a weapon are
changing that picture. First, the release of the virus among the
world's largely unvaccinated population could kill millions of
people. Second, the Clinton administration's pledge to spend
millions of dollars on bioterrorism makes smallpox research a
potential source of money for scientists interested in studying it.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific leaders in the United States, Russia and elsewhere
have begun to debate, often bitterly, why WHO should insist on
destroying a virus that might still exist secretly in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial point in the debate is that irrevocable destruction of
the virus would deprive future generations the opportunity to use
new knowledge and research tools to solve the many mysteries of
smallpox, and thereby unravel mysteries of other ailments as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone can envision situations in which you might want to
take the virus from the freezer,'' said Dr. Harold E. Varmus, who
heads the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been on both sides of the argument at different
times,'' said Dr. Clarence J. Peters, an international leader in
virology who works with smallpox and other lethal viruses at the
centers for disease control.
</P>
<P>
   But several factors make variola studies difficult.
</P>
<P>
   One is that such work must take place in a laboratory with the
highest biosecurity standards. Scientists must wear a protective
spacesuit, isolating them from the laboratory. They wear gloves
that increase the difficulty of handling small vials.
</P>
<P>
   The air they breathe is filtered. On leaving the laboratory,
they must take two showers, the first with a disinfectant. The aim
is to protect themselves and the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nuisance to do experiments in that environment,'' said
Dr. Frank Fenner of Canberra, Australia, a top expert on the pox
family of viruses and a leader in the eradication effort.
</P>
<P>
   There are few high security laboratories, and WHO wants work on
smallpox to be limited to two sites: the CDC in Atlanta and
Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Technology, better
known as Vector.
</P>
<P>
   Competition among scientists for time in the Atlanta laboratory
is intense. Investigations of other deadly viruses, like the newly
discovered Nipah virus, which has recently killed more than 100
people in Malaysia, have highest priority.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a WHO request, scientists will soon pull variola
from a freezer at the centers in Atlanta for the first time in four
years, said Dr. Brian W.J. Mahy, who oversees the agency's smallpox
work. For about a month they will grow the virus, inactivate it
with radiation, and prepare viral proteins that might be used in
standard laboratories to develop more rapid tests to help doctors
detect smallpox, since so few have ever seen it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Experts who favor destroying variola say that most important
research questions about smallpox could be answered from work
conducted in less secure laboratories. Such work would involve
different viruses belonging to the pox family that affect monkeys,
camels and other species.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling reason for keeping variola is to discover
potentially lifesaving drugs in case the virus ever reappears,
either naturally or as an act of war. A report on these research
needs, issued in March by the Institute of Medicine, the medical
arm of the National Academy of Sciences, was pivotal in President
Clinton's decision to reverse course and advocate retaining the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Few potential anti-variola drugs exist, and scientists are
handicapped in developing new ones because the virus naturally
infects only humans and by lack of an animal model for drug tests.
``That's where we are stuck with smallpox,'' Mahy said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Food and Drug Administration approval of 20
antiviral drugs in the last 10 years offers hope of eventually
discovering other drugs that would be effective against variola,
said Dr. Martin S. Hirsch, a virologist at Harvard University who
is a member of the Institute of Medicine committee.
</P>
<P>
   Variola is one of the biggest viruses in size with about 200
genes compared with 9 for the AIDS virus and 3 for Rift Valley
fever virus. Thus variola offers many targets for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Mahy said CDC scientists were looking at new ways to develop
potential anti-variola drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stanley Falkow of Stanford University, a former president of
the American Society for Microbiology, said ``epidemic diseases of
humans are quite recent in the evolutionary sense because human
populations were not big enough to sustain epidemics until about
5,000 years ago, and we don't know'' how best to study them now.
</P>
<P>
   Among smallpox's many unusual features is that a different virus
is used to prevent it. Most vaccines are derived from weakened or
killed strains of the same virus that they prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Only two other diseases are fought with vaccines derived from
different viruses. One is a new rotavirus vaccine made from a
monkey strain to protect humans against the diarrheal illness.
Veterinarians use a vaccine prepared from turkey herpesvirus to
protect chickens against Marek's disease, which is caused by a
different herpesvirus.
</P>
<P>
   If scientists understood the small differences in genetic makeup
between smallpox and vaccinia viruses, smallpox might serve as a
model to develop immunizations for diseases, like dengue fever and
AIDS, for which vaccines are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The successful eradication of smallpox documents the
effectiveness of the standard vaccine. No one gets vaccinated now,
and the remaining supplies are dwindling as many vials lose
potency. If scientists tried to replace it with a safer vaccine,
particularly for people with immune deficiencies from AIDS or
treatment for cancer, live variola might be needed for such
research, said the Institute of Medicine committee, which was
headed by Dr. Charles C.J. Carpenter of Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Donald A. Henderson, who led the smallpox eradication
program, said lack of human cases and an animal model made it
impossible to test safety and effectiveness of new drugs and
vaccines against variola. ``One could never be certain that they
were protective until actually used,'' said Henderson, a former
deputy White House science adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Also, scientists know very little about what makes some viruses
more virulent than others. Varmus of NIH and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci,
who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, expressed hope that future studies of variola's genes and
the way the virus kills cells would help unravel mysteries about
the more general nature of why many infectious agents harm humans.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists can use newer techniques to make mutations in viruses
in the laboratory to study the effects of different genes in new
ways.
</P>
<P>
   In advocating retention of variola, Varmus said that as
scientists learned more about how viruses harmed humans, the virus
that was such a scourge ``ought to be available for study if we had
an important experiment to test.''
</P>
<P>
   At WHO's request, Russian and American scientists mapped the
complete DNA sequences of three strains of variola. WHO believed
that such information would be a sufficient knowledge base for
future research and for comparing viruses released by terrorists or
somehow emerging from nature.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of scientists challenged that view, saying that
sequences alone could not determine a virus' vulnerability to a
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the unpredictability of research, Fauci said, ``You
might never take the virus from the freezer, but at least you have
it.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Anticipation, disappointment, frustration,
anger, humor, even (occasionally) elation. All are emotions that
quickly become familiar to people on and around the legislative
roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is boredom, mind-numbing boredom, a condition that
often consumes all others and can almost make statehouse veterans
temporarily forget whether their programs are up or down.
</P>
<P>
   The recent Senate showdown that saw the death of the hate-crimes
bill was riveting drama. But those moments in the legislative
process are rare. Much more common, particularly this late in a
session, are days like the one last week, when senators, with
little or no debate, approved legislation to stiffen the penalty
for fleeing from a police officer _ and 50 other bills.
</P>
<P>
   All this was done in the space of about five very long hours. It
was not the place to be for someone who had stayed up a bit too
late the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bills _ on subjects as varied as injured workers,
air conditioning contractors and outboard motors _ were passed with
little discussion, let alone debate. Deals, if necessary, had been
privately worked out in advance, as they are on most bills that
pass through the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   There was a great deal of trust, on the part of the bill
sponsors, in the House members or lobbyists who had brought them
the bills and also on the part of the other senators in the bill
sponsors. Legislators don't have time to read most of the thousands
of bills and amendments they vote on each session, although many of
those measures contain hidden time bombs that occasionally explode
during a re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer volume of legislation also hides numerous special
interest provisions that most Texans could very well do without.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bills that passed through the Senate that day still
won't clear all the necessary hurdles and become law. Many probably
shouldn't. Does anyone, for example, really think that a felon who
has just held up a convenience store will worry about an extra slap
on the wrist if he thinks he can outrun the police car in his
rearview mirror?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that bill, if it were to become law and if anyone actually
learned about it, would discourage an occasional speeder from
trying to outrun the blue lights and jeopardizing the safety of
other motorists. But for most practical purposes the measure
probably belongs in the it's-the-thought-that-counts category.
</P>
<P>
   A few bills actually had major statewide significance.
</P>
<P>
   One was a constitutional amendment, which will be on the
November ballot, to clarify how the offices of governor and
lieutenant governor would be filled if Gov. George W. Bush is
elected president next year.
</P>
<P>
   There really wasn't much mystery that Lt. Gov. Rick Perry would
be the next governor. The real question was who would succeed Perry
in the No. 2 job. If voters approve the amendment, the 31 state
senators will pick one of their own to complete Perry's lieutenant
governor's term.
</P>
<P>
   Senators also voted to send another _ and probably more
controversial _ constitutional amendment to the voters. This one
would allow a former spouse's wages to be garnisheed for overdue
alimony.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people may be surprised, but, yes, Texas does allow
alimony now, but only under very limited circumstances. The
Legislature approved it four years ago as part of a welfare-reform
package, and voters will soon get to decide whether to give it some
new teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Although only two senators voted against it, the alimony-related
measure sparked the only semilively debate of the day, which ended
with this quip from Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas: ``Do you remember
that song, It's Cheaper to Keep Her?''
</P>
<P>
   About the only other measure to attract any significant
attention was a bill by Sen. Mike Moncrief, D-Fort Worth, to allow
that city to use a portion of its local hotel and motel tax to
finance a luxury hotel near its downtown convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Some Houston senators, fearing some language in the measure
could hurt Houston's new baseball stadium project, raised enough
questions to prompt Moncrief to postpone a vote on his bill for a
few hours. That gave the Houston senators time to call home and be
assured the bill didn't affect their stadium _ and jeopardize their
political futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Fort Worth thank you,'' Moncrief said after the
bill was revived and senators routinely approved it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not all the people of Fort Worth. The community
leaders and developers who supported the bill, however, were very
grateful.
</P>

NEW DAWN FOR FLAG THAT WAS STILL THERE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Using technology as new as Space Age fabrics and as
ordinary as the chemicals from the corner dry-cleaning shop,
scientists and historians here have taken on the job of cleaning
and preserving the Star-Spangled Banner, the flag that flew over
Fort McHenry in Baltimore in 1814, so that it might last at least
another 185 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our visitors do not know that there was a flag that
inspired `The Star-Spangled Banner,' '' said Lonn Taylor, a
historian at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of
American History and one of the experts working on the flag that
Francis Scott Key saw by dawn's early light.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Thomassen-Krauss, the senior textile conservator for the
project, said the first phase would involve separating the flag
from its linen backing, which was applied in 1914 with an estimated
1.7 million stitches. They will be removed one at a time so that
the big woolen flag is not damaged, and beginning this Friday,
visitors may watch the process at the museum, separated from
workers by a glass wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian project has many elements of a detective story
and, with new research, many clues have been found to solve old
mysteries like the presence of a ``V'' on one stripe.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that is known is that the flag, which signaled to Key
that the British had failed to capture Fort McHenry in the War of
1812, survived all these years in part because it was kept away
from the light, which over time causes the fabric to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   As for the stripes, the researchers have determined that the red
comes from cochineal, a dye made from the dried bodies of female
cochineal insects found in Mexico and the American Southwest, plus
madder, or Rubia tinctorum, a plant probably grown in the
Netherlands or France.
</P>
<P>
   A similar dye was used for the linen threads that attached the
red parts of the flag to the backing, but because linen does not
hold dye as well as wool, ``it creates a netlike effect on the
flag,'' Ms. Thomassen-Krauss said.
</P>
<P>
   In a square-foot area where the threads have been removed, the
red is brighter because the haze effect of the threads is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The same will hold true when the blue threads are removed. Many
of the flag's threads are cracked, a result of flapping in the
wind, age and the small amounts of light it has been exposed to.
</P>
<P>
   The flag, once 42 feet by 30 feet but now reduced to 33 by 30
from what Ms. Thomassen-Krauss describes as ``souveniring,'' has
been rolled onto a tube resembling a huge paper towel holder. The
next step will be to roll the flag out slowly, as museum visitors
watch, and snip away the threads holding it to the linen backing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, said Anthony Maher, a project manager with the
architectural and engineering firm of KCF-SHG, which designed the
laboratory in the Smithsonian where the work is to be done, the
flag will be laid on an inert modern fabric called Tyvec and rolled
back on the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Next, it will be unrolled slowly, and dry-cleaning fluid will be
dripped through the fabric as it comes off the tube.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 35 years, the flag has been on display at the
American history museum and before that in the Smithsonian's Art
and Industries Building, all the while attracting more dirt and
grime despite efforts on a smaller scale to clean it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomassen-Krauss said that the fluid probably would be
chlorinated hydrocarbons, the same substance that is effective in
removing lipstick stains from blouses. And, like lipstick, much of
the flag's soil has an oil base, brought by the air from the
exhaust of cars passing outside the museum or from elevators and
escalators inside.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the soil is exotic, as revealed last year by a camera
that NASA usually uses to peer into the heavens. ``We had a
photograph that showed pollen grains, clay and fibers,'' Ms.
Thomassen-Krauss said. ``One of my colleagues said that it looked
like Bourbon Street after Mardi Gras.''
</P>
<P>
   Chlorinated hydrocarbons are a health danger, but the
technicians will work for short periods in a well-ventilated
enclosed area.
</P>
<P>
   And, the hydrocarbons are deemed preferable to the alternatives
of acetone and petroleum distillates, which are highly flammable
and could wind up doing what the British tried to do.
</P>
<P>
   Once the cleaning is completed, the flag will be displayed anew,
although officials have not decided exactly how.
</P>
<P>
   A glass case is being considered, but it would have to be as big
as the facade of a three-story house and filled with a gas like
argon or nitrogen that would displace oxygen, the culprit along
with light in the deterioration of wool.
</P>
<P>
   The project's cost is estimated at $18 million, of which $10
million has been donated by Polo Ralph Lauren and $3 million by the
Pew Charitable Trusts.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Smithsonian history, ``The Star-Spangled Banner''
entered American folklore after Key, a Washington lawyer, went to a
British truce ship on Sept. 13, 1814, to try to negotiate the
release of Dr. John Beanes, who had been seized by the invading
British in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   While Key was aboard the ship, a heavy rain fell and the British
bombarded Fort McHenry.
</P>
<P>
   The American cannons returned the fire, leading the British to
detain Key on the ship overnight, although he was a negotiator, not
a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the night worrying that Fort McHenry was falling to the
British.
</P>
<P>
   The British had already sacked Washington, burning the White
House in the process, and many feared that if the British captured
Baltimore, it would lead to the undoing of the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn, the rain stopped and the British warships departed.
Maj. George Armistead, Fort McHenry's commander, lowered a smaller
storm flag that he had flown during the rain, and in its place he
flew the huge flag that he had ordered earlier from a Baltimore
flag maker, Mary Pickersgill.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Key, still aboard the truce ship, saw the flag
and was so inspired by the sight that he took a letter from his
pocket and wrote a poem on its back. He called his poem ``The
Defense of Fort McHenry,'' but he soon renamed it ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   It was set to the popular English tune ``To Anacreon in
Heaven,'' which was about a Greek poet, and it was first performed
in Baltimore in 1814. Americans have struggled to sing it ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   After the battle, the widow of a soldier killed in the
bombardment asked Armistead for a piece of the flag as a
remembrance, and he complied, a military practice that continued
until the end of the Civil War. That explains why the flag has been
reduced in size, but no one is sure how it lost one of its 15
stars, which is represented today by a later embroidery.
</P>
<P>
   Another mystery apparently is close to being solved by careful
examination of the flag. For years, people have been puzzled by the
letter ``V'' sewn onto one of the stripes. ``I'm reasonably sure
that is the beginning of the letter `A,''' Taylor, the historian,
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``A'' would have stood for Armistead, whose descendants kept
the flag, presumably away from the light, until donating it to the
Smithsonian in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is an `A' without the crossbar,'' Taylor said. ``It
was either never on or it fell off.''

WEIGHT REGAIN STATISTIC SEEMS 95 PERCENT MYTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Conn., Colo., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By JANE FRITSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a depressing article of faith among the overweight and
those who treat them that 95 percent of people who lose weight
regain it _ and sometimes more _ within a few months or years.
</P>
<P>
   That statistic has been quoted widely over the last four
decades, in congressional hearings, diet books, research papers and
seminars. And it is the reason so many people approach dieting with
a sense of hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, obesity researchers say, no one has any idea how
many people can lose weight and keep it off. Now, as researchers
try to determine how many people have succeeded, they are also
studying the success stories for lessons that might inspire others
to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 95 percent figure has become clinical lore,'' said Dr.
Thomas Wadden, a professor of psychiatry at the University of
Pennsylvania. There is no basis for it, he said, ``but it's part of
the mythology of obesity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kelly D. Brownell, the director of the Yale Center for
Eating and Weight Disorders, said the number was first suggested in
a 1959 clinical study of only 100 people. The finding was repeated
so often that it came to be regarded as fact, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, nearly all studies of weight-loss recidivism have
followed patients in formal hospital or university programs,
because they are the easiest to identify and keep track of. But
people who turn to such programs may also be the most difficult
cases, and may therefore have especially poor success rates.
</P>
<P>
   To get a more accurate picture, two researchers are studying
long-term dieters for a project called the National Weight Control
Registry, and have found it surprisingly easy to collect success
stories. About half the people who maintained a substantial weight
loss for more than a year had done it on their own, they found.
This suggests that many people have found ways to lose weight and
keep it off, but have never been counted in formal studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something very optimistic about this whole data
set,'' said Dr. Rena Wing, a professor of psychiatry at the
University of Pittsburgh and the Brown University School of
Medicine. ``Without much effort, we have identified 2,500 people
who have succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wing and Dr. James O. Hill of the University of Colorado are
collaborating on the registry project, which they began five years
ago with financing from drug companies and other sources. They are
compiling detailed histories of successful long-term dieters _
people who had maintained a weight loss of at least 30 pounds for
at least one year. Most of the volunteers were solicited through
articles in newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really to convince ourselves and convince the world
that there are people who are successful, and then to learn from
them,'' Dr. Wing said.
</P>
<P>
   To their surprise, Dr. Wing and Hill found that on average the
respondents had maintained a 67-pound weight loss for five years.
Between 12 percent and 14 percent had maintained a loss of more
than 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The success stories might not have been so surprising had it
been clear that the 95 percent failure rate was so poorly founded.
The figure comes not from any kind of random sampling, but from a
study of 100 patients treated for obesity at a nutrition clinic at
New York Hospital in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, its authors, Dr. Albert Stunkard and Mavis
McLaren-Hume, published a paper in which they concluded, ``Most
obese persons will not stay in treatment, most will not lose
weight, and of those who do lose weight, most will regain it.''
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion, Brownell of Yale said, has since become the
most frequently quoted statement in obesity literature.
</P>
<P>
   Stunkard, who is now a professor of psychiatry at the University
of Pennsylvania, said the study was ``perfectly respectable'' for
that period. ``The paper made a big impact because everybody
thought obesity was pretty easy to treat,'' he said. ``This showed
that, for whatever reason, it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But the study has little relevance to the current understanding
of how to control weight, said Stunkard, who specializes in the
treatment of obesity and eating disorders. The 100 patients in the
study were ``just given a diet and sent on their way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was state of the art in 1959,'' he added. ``I've been
sort of surprised that people keep citing it; I know we do better
these days.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The intervening years have brought significant changes to the
treatment of obesity, the most important of which, Stunkard said,
has been the introduction of behavior modification techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1959 study, though, the statistic has been reinforced
by most other clinical studies, which also showed people with
discouraging results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we can prove they're typical, the data cannot be
generalized,'' Brownell said. ``The people we see in clinics tend
to be more overweight and have more psychological problems. They
are more likely by a factor of two to have binge-eating problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The true failure rate could be much better, or much worse, he
said. ``The fact is that we just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The new research on successful dieters will disappoint those
hoping for a magic-bullet solution; most had simply eaten less, and
healthier, food, and exercised regularly. But judging by their
accounts, it is entirely possible for people without the resources
to hire personal trainers and chefs to accomplish permanent weight
loss.
</P>
<P>
   For inspiration, it would be difficult to surpass the story one
of the participants in the Weight Control Registry, Tammy Munson,
32, a receptionist and ambulance dispatcher from Jamestown, N.Y.,
who lost 147 pounds and has kept it off for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 4 inches tall and 185 pounds, she was overweight
throughout high school, but ballooned to 253 after she graduated
and got married. She knew little about nutrition, she recalled, and
``didn't even realize that liquid had calories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get up in the morning and have ice cream and cookies,''
Ms. Munson said. Dinner might be three or four fast-food hamburgers
and candy bars. Her husband, Jeffrey, who has lost 100 pounds, was
also seriously overweight. ``Our wedding pictures are really
funny,'' she said. ``We broke the bed when we were first married.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Munson began to face her weight problem, she said, when her
blood pressure began to rise. At first she did some crash dieting,
eating only about 650 calories a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read every book in the library about how to keep the weight
off,'' she said, and eventually settled on a more balanced approach
that included salads, fish, vegetable burgers, fruit and always a
little dessert. And exercise. She exercises to a tape every day,
jumps rope, and has begun running.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Ms. Munson attributes her success at least in part to
the fact that she did not know success was supposedly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to find it for yourself,'' she said. ``And don't
spend money on it. You can get it for free. You can get if from
reading. It's just the food pyramid, but people don't want to hear
it. Slimfast, Optifast, you can't live like that forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You eat a lot of good stuff and a little bad stuff, and you'll
be fine, but you've got to have the little bad stuff, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Russell M. Lomando, 47, of Brooklyn, was less
dramatic, but probably more typical of the people in the study. ``I
was 39 years old and I was walking up the train stairs in Brooklyn
huffing and puffing,'' he said. ``I could see myself going into the
grave when I was 40.'' He used to eat, he said, ``pounds of junk _
donuts and cookies and cakes, and I'm talking boxes at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, climbing the subway stairs, Lomando made up his mind to
cut out the junk, but gradually.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he was able to do it only four days a week; he worked
up to seven over a period of months. He took up karate for
exercise, and over two years lost 50 pounds, getting his weight
down to 160.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to change your life style,'' he said. ``You just
have to have the will power to do it.'' But that is not necessarily
easy, he conceded. ``You just have to weigh the choices. Do you
want to become healthier?''

   Cosmic Collision
</P>
<P>
   Q. Pluto sometimes crosses the orbit of Neptune, suggesting to
me that they might collide at some point. Should I worry?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, in the opinion of Dr. Bryan G. Marsden, associate
director for planetary sciences at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. Their closest approach is not
that close, he said, but about as far as the distance between
Uranus and the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   One reason they cannot pass any closer is that Neptune goes
around in its orbit three times in the time that Pluto goes around
twice, he said. This exact relationship is called a resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Another such relationship, called the Kozae resonance, provides
an added protection, Marsden said. The orbit of Pluto is not in the
same plane as Neptune's but is inclined to it at an angle of about
17 degrees. When Pluto is closest to the Sun, it is about as far
away from Neptune's orbital plane as it can be, and there is close
to the maximum separation when the two planets are crossing at the
same distance from the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the planets didn't have these protections, a collision
would have happened long ago and we would never have known about
Pluto's existence,'' Marsden said. ``Perhaps over hundreds of
millions of years they could get out of resonance, but that is a
long enough period that we wouldn't have to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Pluto is not alone in the Kozae resonance; at least 50 other
objects in orbit around the Sun, called Plutinos, enjoy the same
protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I have seen the future _ and I prefer the past. Or is it the
other way around?
</P>
<P>
   The glimpses of what was and what could be came courtesy of a
recent visit to a ``body-morphing station.'' The computerized gizmo
is not unlike a fun-house mirror that distorts your image until you
appear ridiculously thin or grotesquely fat. But here the goal was
not idle amusement but education (OK, it was really a way to help
shill a new product, but we'll get to that later).
</P>
<P>
   The morphing station, which is available only at news media
events, may eventually find its way into malls. To use one, you
start by having someone else enter your weight and height to
determine your body mass index _ or BMI, a measure of weight in
relation to height _ while a camera records your image.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the fun part. The software allows you to shrink your
image to show what you might look like if you lost 15 percent of
your weight or, if you dare, expand it to show a 30 percent gain.
Then it tells you how your chances of contracting various
weight-related maladies _ heart disease, diabetes and high blood
pressure _ shift with the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Being a person of moderation (whatever else my BMI, described as
borderline problematic, might suggest), I opted to be blown up by a
mere 20 percent. In a flash, the screen showed what the future
might hold if I were to make too many trips to the ice cream parlor
and not enough to the gym.
</P>
<P>
   My cheeks swelled, my jowls seemed to droop and the stripes on
my shirt looked like they were trying to escape from one another.
More unsettling, all my disease-risk rates shot up significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Then I had them shrink the original me by 10 percent, and
listened as the dietitian noted with approval the improvement in my
disease statistics. I was too busy, though, watching the thinner,
vaguely familiar figure from the past looking out at me from the
screen. It looked like someone I went to school with.
</P>
<P>
   The machines are being used by the pharmaceutical company
Hoffmann-La Roche to help promote its new weight-loss drug,
Xenical.
</P>
<P>
   I may be taking the wrong attitude to the whole thing. The
dietitians say they generally use the machines to show people how
they would look if they lost weight, not gained it. It is an
incentive, in other words, not a threat. So that slim fellow I was
looking at could well be my future.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the morphing station will print out pictures of both. I
know which one I am more likely to hang on the refrigerator.

IOWA REPORTER WILL BE BUSH'S PRIMARY OBSTACLE AND TEST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In planning a presidential campaign, one of the
first steps for a serious candidate is ascending Mount Yepsen.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush is no different.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime during Bush's first, brief campaign visit to Iowa next
month, it's a good bet that the Texas governor will seek to find
time to make the climb.
</P>
<P>
   As chief political reporter for the Des Moines Register, Iowa's
dominant newspaper, David Yepsen is a towering figure on the road
to the Iowa caucuses, traditionally the first important test for
White House aspirants.
</P>
<P>
   He is _ the candidates, their counselors and media mavens agree
_ a singular journalistic figure in the early presidential
contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anyone who comes close,'' said Cheryl
Arvidson, senior writer at the Freedom Forum and an acquaintance of
Yepsen's since their days at the University of Iowa 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``David is really recognized as the most knowledgeable, most
perceptive Iowa reporter when it comes to the presidential
caucuses,'' said Eric Woolson, who was once a competitor while
covering politics for the Waterloo Courier and then a source as
press secretary to recently retired Gov. Terry Branstad. Woolson is
now spokesman for Bush in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Even before their anticipated sit-down, Yepsen has assessed the
monumental expectations for Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a little too early for the governor to be writing
his inaugural address,'' Yepsen said in a recent column. ``There
are things about Bush that bring to mind President John Connally,
President John Glenn and President Edward Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yepsen recalled former President Bush's intimate attention to
Iowa in his first White House run in 1980 and his victory in the
caucuses that year over front-running Ronald Reagan, who barely
deigned to fly over the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, you better remember that the next time one of your
high-paid consultants says you can win this thing sitting on your
behind in Austin,'' Yepsen wrote in his characteristically
down-to-earth style.
</P>
<P>
   It was not lost on Bush and his advisers that through the six
sets of caucuses that Yepsen has covered, he has often been the
first person to publicly point out weaknesses in campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Yepsen, however, wears his stature and quadrennial celebrity
modestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly other reporters around here who cover this
game,'' Yepsen said.
</P>
<P>
   The only name, however, usually offered as a runner-up to Yepsen
in journalistic influence is Mike Glover, the highly regarded Iowa
capitol reporter for The Associated Press. He and Yepsen often
appear together on a public-affairs program on Iowa public
television.
</P>
<P>
   Yepsen takes a matter-of-fact approach to his position and the
consequent dealings with candidates and their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a job to do. I have a job to do,'' Yepsen said. ``I
cover this game, and so they want to be covered, and they also want
to get their message through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't me. If anybody else was sitting in this job, it would
be them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yepsen does have the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just so uniquely dominant because the Register is
uniquely dominant,'' said Mike McCurry, who before his recent stint
as White House press secretary handled a string of losing
Democratic presidential contenders (then-Senator Glenn in 1984;
Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, now the Interior secretary, in 1988;
and Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska in 1992).
</P>
<P>
   Local television coverage of presidential politics in Iowa is
generally spotty and superficial.
</P>
<P>
   More intense local television coverage traditionally doesn't
kick in until the campaign moves on to New Hampshire, where
Manchester-based WMUR is the only network-affiliated station in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   WMUR's Scott Spradling this week offered a cautionary
Yepsen-esque assessment of possible weaknesses in Bush's campaign,
including his trouble so far getting his school voucher and hefty
tax-cut plans through the Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Yepsen's view is also valued by newspaper and magazine
journalists from around the country and the world who troop to
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the guy whom everyone turns to make an assessment of the
candidates,'' McCurry said. Over the years, Yepsen has been quoted
in a number of Chronicle articles about Iowa politics.
</P>
<P>
   Yepsen is most sought after, however, by the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach was always the same,'' McCurry said. ``To haul
him down to the Savery (Hotel) coffee show and get him there and
have coffee and eggs with the guy running for president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just sits there and pulls out his notebook and listens to
the future leader of the free world try out his stuff,'' McCurry
said.

George Pataki throws his political muscle behind Bush's

conservativism and in the process built a party that has supported
him with overwhelming votes from the Hispanic community, from
women, from African-Americans across Texas,'' Pataki says. The
announcement, three weeks in the making, includes a live satellite

ENLISTED MAN: CLANCY LENDS BESTSELLER STATUS TO A HERO'S STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Tom Clancy's admiration for military heroes is genuine.
</P>
<P>
   The bestselling author's novels and nonfiction books celebrate
men who believe in decisive action when American shores and/or
foreign interests are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence also can be seen in his own back yard, literally.
</P>
<P>
   The man owns a tank.
</P>
<P>
   But the real passion is revealed when Clancy, 52, talks about
retired Air Force Gen. Chuck Horner, co-author of ``Every Man a
Tiger'' (Putnam, $27.95), the current Clancy bestseller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a minstrel, and I write about warriors,'' Clancy croons,
his usually clipped, harsh voice suddenly turning soft. ``That man
is a real warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Knock it off,'' orders Horner. The trim, 63-year-old is seated
on a low couch on the other side of the living room in a luxurious
suite at The Mansion on Turtle Creek where the duo has paused
momentarily during a whirlwind national tour promoting ``Every Man
a Tiger.'' ``Don't listen to this guy. He doesn't know what he's
talking about,'' quips Horner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crap,'' Clancy snaps, stubbing out one half-smoked cigarette
and lighting another. ``You're a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you say,'' Horner says, sighing and rolling his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn right, that's what I say.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy and Horner are a bit more agreeable when the subject
turns to how they teamed up to write the book, which uses Horner's
distinguished Air Force career as a framework to teach readers
about problems and changes in the military approach to national
defense in the past four decades. Horner, who concluded his
military service designing and directing the Coalition air assault
during Desert Storm, wanted to write his memoirs focusing on how
lessons learned in the Vietnam debacle enabled the Coalition to
crush Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces. Like most fledgling authors,
though, he didn't know how to get published.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that he was working on a book, so I got him in touch
with my agent,'' says Clancy, adding that he and Horner had not yet
met at the time. ``They talked, and then my agent calls and tells
me I ought to get involved in the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy, with a long string of fiction bestsellers, already had
written six nonfiction books about military history and strategy,
including one with retired Army Gen. Fred Franks. He said he is
occasionally moved to write military history, ``because the public
schools are crap. They don't teach history there anymore.
Geography, either. You can't find a kid in a public school who can
find Belgium on a map. Me, I've been a historian since I was 8, 9
years old. So I try to put it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Horner and Clancy got together. Within 10 minutes, Clancy
claims, he knew they were friends for life and would write a great
book together.
</P>
<P>
   They disagree, again, on how the book was written. Clancy says
he simply served as editor, asking Horner questions and, sometimes,
forcing the much-decorated fighter pilot to relive moments he'd
sooner have forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not true at all,'' Horner insists. ``Tom Clancy is a genius.
He crafted the whole thing. My concern was that the book should be
entertaining, not boring. It wouldn't be a good book if people
glanced at a page or two and put it down.''
</P>
<P>
   From the opening scenes, when Iraq overruns Kuwait and Horner is
summoned by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf to brief President George Bush
on U.S. air readiness for response, ``Every Man a Tiger'' brings
readers into planning sessions and bomber cockpits from peacetime
Lakenheath Air Force Base in England to the Vietnam jungles.
Clancy's third-person narration links first-person recollections
from Horner. The Horner/Clancy team doesn't spare criticism for
military blunders, and it emphasizes Horner's personal faith in
God, country and family without lathering on too much emotional
treacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because this is history,'' Clancy notes. ``We had to
put a lot of Chuck in here. Readers need to understand that most of
our military leaders are gifted, solid men. But Chuck is always
honest. When you read this book, you know it's for real.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Horner wanted an entertaining book, Clancy says he has
his own yardstick for whether ``Every Man a Tiger'' is a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how much it sells,'' Clancy snaps. ``That's why you
write books, so a lot of people will read them. I've learned
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of his own success, it's hard to recall that Tom Clancy
was an absolute unknown just 15 years ago. The owner of an
independent insurance business, the military-obsessed Clancy _ who
never served in the armed forces _ managed to churn out a novel in
his spare time. Based on a failed 1975 defection attempt by a
Soviet naval officer, ``The Hunt for Red October'' was eventually
published in 1984 by the tiny Naval Institute Press. Someone,
however, gave a copy to President Ronald Reagan, who loved the book
and touted it during press briefings. ``Red October'' rocketed up
the bestseller list and eventually was made into a hugely
successful movie. Clancy gave up the insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't take bestseller status for granted. Fans who
write to Clancy in care of his publisher often receive personal
replies, especially if they have technical questions about one of
his books.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta respond to the fans,'' Clancy says. ``You interest
somebody enough for him to ask a good question, well, maybe it
deserves a good answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Clancy and Horner hope readers find questions in, and get
answers from, ``Every Man a Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is about leadership,'' Horner says. ``It's about
how common sense, planning and valuing the people working with you
can bring about good results. Leadership is leadership, whether
it's in the military or a tire store. Too often, the military or a
business tries to invent artificial mumbo-jumbo. Well, human beings
operate best on steady principles; the courage to tell the truth,
attention to personal appearance, responsibility for one another.
Informed chain of command, too. If I'd dropped dead during Desert
Storm, our strategy still would have worked because people were
ready to step in as needed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It ought to be a simple lesson,'' adds Clancy. ``The good
companies like Disney or Microsoft know they have to take care of
their people. A lot of other companies have crap for policy.''
</P>
<P>
   After another week of book signings and interviews around the
country, Clancy and Horner head home _ Maryland for Clancy, Florida
for Horner. If ``Every Man a Tiger'' is successful enough, they
might team up for another book.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even if we don't, we'll always be in touch,'' Clancy says,
lighting his seventh cigarette during a 45-minute interview. ``I've
got a lot more to learn from this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Crap,'' Horner says, laughing, co-opting Clancy's favorite
word. The two men grin at each other.

SUSHI CHEFS SEE A RAW DEAL IN NEW YORK HEALTH LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LINDA TRISCHITTA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ A state law that requires the servers
and preparers of uncooked food to don gloves is a recipe for a
culture clash. Sushi chefs claim compliance with the health code
inhibits their ability to create their edible art to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe sushi is an art,'' said Minoru ``Mino''
Kawaguchi, owner of Mino's Sushi House in Saratoga Springs. ``It's
a very old discipline. Japanese traditions are misunderstood.''
</P>
<P>
   Kawaguchi was cited twice and fined $1,000 for bare-hand contact
with raw food, a violation of the state sanitary code. State health
officials say sushi chefs should follow the same regulations as
other restaurant workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make this citation almost daily in every type of restaurant,
and bare hand contact almost always goes to legal actions,'' said
State Department of Health Sanitarian Joe Curatolo, who levied the
fine against Mino's.
</P>
<P>
   Sushi chefs are part of a centuries-old, pre-refrigeration
culinary tradition. In Japan, apprentices can spend three years
working only with rice before being allowed to cut fish. They rely
on their bare hands to feel for parasites, filet fish properly and
reveal patterns in the flesh that appeal to the eye and signify the
tender cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Sushi masters say they can accurately guess the number of rice
grains within their palms, a skill that along with speed is
celebrated in contests back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very good sushi chef washes their hands a lot to keep them
very cold and prevent hand oils from tainting the flavor of the
fish,'' Kawaguchi said. ``We don't hold the fish long.''
</P>
<P>
   The code does not require donning gloves for a full shift but
the accessories are mandatory when the preparer uses both hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sub shop, gloves should be changed every two sandwiches
or so,'' Curatolo said.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that food preparers' dexterity would not be
impaired. ``Surgeons wear gloves that allow them to do many
tasks,'' he said. ``Hands in the water all the time is a negative.
We're talking viral and bacteriological problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Susumu Omiya, owner of Mari Japanese Cuisine in Burnt Hills who
said his chefs wear the gloves ``most of the time,'' has not been
fined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chefs need to feel if the fish is spoiled and for the
level of oil. It's a judgment (they need to make) and that's the
last chance before it goes to the customer,'' Omiya said. ``With
gloves we're missing that. Gloves take the technique out of the
program. And it's hard to go fast. The human hand is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Kawaguchi, 43, came to the United States 18 years ago and owned
eight restaurants in Greenwich Village, Albany and California
before settling in Saratoga Springs. He said the fine, which he
negotiated down to $250, was not an ethnic or cultural insult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my lawyer that it's not fair, but he said I'm lucky. I
have to obey the regulations,'' he said. ``If I had a big chain of
restaurants, I might appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Omiya said his chefs understand sanitary conditions but he feels
sushi is a special case. ``If we cut a finger we wear gloves to
protect the public,'' Omiya said. ``It's common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ruben, a former resident of Japan who teaches the
cuisine _ without gloves _ to hundreds of students at six cooking
schools in Manhattan, said he does not understand the logic of the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wearing a latex glove, well, if they push their hair back or
sneeze, the glove is just as contaminated as a bare hand,'' Ruben
said. ``The sandwich maker who wears that vile glove all day long
is also an offender.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruben, calling Kawaguchi's case ``a travesty,'' said the
precautions seemed excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York City, I have never seen a sushi chef wear
gloves,'' he said. ``I would love to see them go into every sushi
restaurant here. It would cause an uproar.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're a paranoid nation, especially in light of
e-coli.''
</P>
<P>
   Kawaguchi could be closed down if he is caught without gloves in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to penalize people. It's a training process,''
said Curatolo, who is working with two Japanese restaurateurs to
open places in Saratoga Springs. ``Sushi chefs are within their
right to go to the state Legislature to have the code changed. They
have to demonstrate scientific proof that they won't endanger the
public with bare hand contact.''

THEY'RE NOT THE CHICKS, BUT THESE NEW GIRL GROUPS DO BEAR A
RESEMBLANCE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   What hath the Dixie Chicks wrought?
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the photos that accompany their media handouts: A
trio of new groups, all featuring cute young blond women singing
songs full o' sass and heartache with sweet, airy harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   The field is not so crowded with young girl-group hopefuls
bearing at least some resemblance to Dallas' Chicks that we need a
score card (not yet), but let's get the players straightened out:
</P>
<P>
   SheDaisy: Sisters Kristyn, Kelsi and Kassidy Osborn from Magna,
Utah. The debut single from their new ``The Whole SheBang'' CD,
``Little Good-Byes,'' is at No. 26 on the national country singles
charts.
</P>
<P>
   Redmon &AMP; Vale: Pals Allison Redmon and Tina Vale, who came from
Lilburn, Ga., and Elko, Nev., respectively, to form a duo in
Nashville and record a CD, due for release in July. All that's
available right now is the single ``If I Had a Nickel (One Thin
Dime),'' which is picking up some airplay.
</P>
<P>
   Mulberry Lane: Sisters Heather, Jaymie, Rachel and Allie
Rizzuto; they're from Omaha (specifically, a street called Mulberry
Lane), their sound is folk-pop with more R&AMP;B-smart rhythmic
touches. Their debut CD, ``Run Your Own Race,'' was released this
month, and the flagship single, ``Harmless,'' is, as they say,
climbing the charts.
</P>
<P>
   No, SheDaisy, Redmon &AMP; Vale and Mulberry Lane do not all sound
alike _ and none of them sounds exactly like the Chicks; Mulberry
Lane is a far more straight-ahead pop group, with country touches
well to the back.
</P>
<P>
   But the musical similarities (especially with SheDaisy and R&AMP;V)
are clearly there, and the look and basic sound of all three are
eerily familiar and fairly scream Emily, Natalie and Martie.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Released in January 1998, the Chicks' ``Wide Open
Spaces'' has sold more than 5 million copies, won the trio two
Grammys (including Best Country Album) and earned them a spot both
opening stadium shows for George Strait and playing numerous dates
on this summer's edition of Lilith Fair.
</P>
<P>
   What's not to emulate?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync _ like all the cute
Texas guys, the hat acts that came out a couple years ago,'' says
Linda O'Brian, music director for KSCS. ``It's a fad. It always
happens. Some people in the industry are calling SheDaisy the
Disney Chicks, because they're signed to Lyric Street, a Disney
label.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories of these three acts, too, share a common thread: All
these women, we're told, grew up in small towns, went to Nashville,
toughed it out awhile, and finally hit on the perfect combination
of harmonies and songwriting. SheDaisy came to Nashville a decade
ago, performing first as the Osborn Sisters and then the Violets
before signing with Lyric Street.
</P>
<P>
   And all three, of course, have released a CD with a lot of
breezy, accessible music _ but also, let's note, songs about women
not taking any nonsense from any menfolk, darn it.
</P>
<P>
   The theme runs most strongly through SheDaisy's debut, ``The
Whole SheBang''; in addition to ``Good-Byes,'' there is also ``I
Will ... But,'' in which the narrator refuses to be her sweetie's
dirty secret, cure-all pill, Friday paycheck, Barbie doll or Martha
Stewart (?) _ but she will be your ``everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmon &AMP; Vale's ``Nickel,'' too, is all about empowerment: ``If
I had a nickel for every time I wished your love was still mine/I'd
have one thin dime,'' they chime.
</P>
<P>
   Best breakout potential of the three? At present, the smart
money's on SheDaisy; they have the best songs (which come from
Kristyn), a pleasing sound, and a 13-minute profile film that's
been shown to radio and retail. And because of all this,
``Good-Byes'' is doing fairly well on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   And lest we think this is all cynical timing on the part of
record labels, well, at least one country expert doesn't see it
that way. Janine Matteson, country editor at ``Gavin,'' strenuously
defends SheDaisy, saying that she ``doesn't see a slew of Dixie
Chickettes coming out.'' Country listeners _ and journalists _ need
to look beyond the surface similarities and dig a little deeper,
she says, and give each group a chance based on its own merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labels want to find a unique sound,'' she says. ``The Chicks
proved that different isn't bad. I think country has a tendency to
pigeonhole _ if we have one of anything, we don't think we need any
more. We have a narrow vision.''

FOR DISABLED ARTISTS, CREATIVITY HAS NO BOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SELNA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Regina Broussard is known for her distinctive
drawings resembling ancient wood carvings or hieroglyphics. Judith
Scott's fiber art _ sculptures wrapped in string and other
discarded materials _ has been acquired by a museum in Paris and is
the subject of a book.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many artists, Broussard and Scott have attained critical
acclaim and financial success. But these women, and other artists
at their Oakland studio, are exceptional in another way: They are
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Oakland's Creative Growth Art Center and Gallery is
celebrating its 25th year as a haven where physically and mentally
disabled adults learn, create and showcase their talents. A gala
earlier this month attracted hundreds of supporters and collectors
eager to see the gallery's latest additions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This artwork defies conventional wisdom,'' said Irene Brydon,
the center's executive director. ``Disabled artists do work that
trained artists can't imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Brydon said the center, which was the first of its kind in the
United States and has produced close to 500,000 pieces of art, has
seen an enormous increase in visiting collectors over the last five
years, due in part to the popularity of ``outsider art.''
</P>
<P>
   Outsider art, Brydon said, has its roots in ``brut art,'' a name
given to late 19th-century work produced by artists in mental
institutions. Today, Brydon said, the term defines art produced
outside mainstream galleries by those ``ignored, isolated or
marginalized by society.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal labeled outsider art a trend in the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, outsider art is characterized by its raw, direct
themes and style, which are being emulated by more and more
mainstream artists.
</P>
<P>
   But to the 90 or so artists preoccupied with their creative
pursuits on any given day at Creative Growth, labels are
insignificant. They would rather create art than talk about it,
said instructor Stan Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   In flashes of inspiration, Louie Estape dreams up abstract
gorillas and other creatures, and later carves the shapes out of
wood, adorning them with repetitive geometric designs, circles and
brilliant colors.
</P>
<P>
   Autistic artist William Tyler uses colored pencils and ink to
produce precise, linear renderings with social themes. Carl
Hendricksen, who has cerebral palsy, constructs a multifeatured
wooden chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of their work is nontraditional and obsessional, with
the same theme repeated over and over again _ as if they need to do
it,'' Brydon said.
</P>
<P>
   Most participants come to the center on referral from social
service workers or other caregivers, although some learn of it on
their own, Brydon said.
</P>
<P>
   The artists' disabilities include a spectrum of mental and
physical challenges, but to get into the program, an individual
must demonstrate a real interest in art.
</P>
<P>
   Started with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts,
the licensed day care program receives 70 percent of its funding
from the state Department of Developmental Services. The center
must raise money through grants and gallery sales to supplement its
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's cultural arts department also contributes some money,
and 13 part-time teachers are provided by the Oakland Public
Schools adult education division. Some instructors teach classes
that focus on independent living, while other artists/mentors with
master's degrees teach and supervise creative arts, including
drawing, painting, print making, ceramics, wood sculpture, rug and
furniture making.
</P>
<P>
   The Creative Growth gallery is filled with the participants'
artwork and puts on exhibits every six to eight weeks. Brydon said
the gallery, which attracts more than 4,000 visitors a year, earns
about $100,000 a year, with half going to the artists.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for artwork range from $12 to $1,000, Brydon said. All of
the center's 125 clients are given some compensation quarterly,
regardless of whether their art sells.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, a wood sculptor who has been teaching at Creative
Growth since 1985, said he works more individually with the artists
than he would in a conventional program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You move from student to student, each with different skills
and disabilities,'' Peterson said. ``Some have problems with speech
or deafness, others are not able to use their hands or feet ... it
is a really interesting environment to teach in. It keeps you on
your toes at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference, said Peterson, is the reward and inspiration
he receives from his students.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are very appreciative of any assistance you give
them, and they are very self-motivated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reanne Estrada, a sculptor and performance artist who teaches
rug making, said that like all artists, those at Creative Growth
are inspired by their lives outside the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sense of humor and are interested in pop culture
like contemporary music and television ... their lives very much
inform their art.''

   HONDA _ Economic development officials in Georgia have asked
Honda executives to meet with them and explain why the state keeps
coming up the bridesmaid in the courtship of auto plants. We're

Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   NEWCARE _ The Atlanta-based nursing home operator announces a
restructuring, in which it's selling 5 nursing homes and striking a
deal with a Massachusetts company to manage its facilities. Newcare
is a small company, about $66 million in annual revenues. and the
stock has fallen to less than $1. But the restructuring reflects
the turmoil within the long-term care industry. (Miller, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 8
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-ANGEL _ ATLANTA _ Don't believe the hype. Venture

</P>

   COXNET PTECH 0525 GENEALOGY _ The computer does two things that
make genealogy simpler, more fun and more efficient: It organizes
records, and it links hobbyists through the Internet for the
exchange of ideas and information. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News)
Art includes one 4-column color illustration of a family tree on a

   TECH BRIEFS _ If your child has not taken to reading with the
same enthusiasm and skill as he has taken to video games, there's a
new Web site that might help. (Clothier, Atlanta

Web site of Sylban Learning Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY _ Can we have some privacy? That's what folks will
tell you, if you ask about the fears they have of the Internet and
the Web. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) Art includes 1

</P>
<P>
   TRENDS _ Parents have mixed feelings about kids exploring the
Internet, according to a news study. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) Art includes one 1-column color illustration
of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   DOMAIN-NAMES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The process of registering a
domain name, which is simpler than it used to be, is still not as
effortless as it could be. But soon, it will be a little easier and
likely cheaper if a plan to include more registrars and add new
domain suffixes is successful. (Gallaga, Austin
American-Statesman). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY_ I was thinking about pocket calculators the other
day. I remembered, back in the 1970s, saving up about $400 to buy a
Hewlett Packard calculator. It was an amazing device then. It could
add, multiply and divide, as well as do all sort of math problems
that would have made my high school trig teacher proud. It was a
marvel of the time _ all that power packed into a gizmo small
enough to fit into my jacket pocket. Nowadays, of course, you can
find more powerful pocket calculators for $4 hanging in those
little shrinkwrap packages as you stand in the grocery store
checkout line. That's one of the real marvels of technology _ how
prices drop so fast. Think of any gadget you care to mention _
microwave oven, VCR, color television _ and, if you are old enough,
you'll be struck by how expensive it once was and how cheap it is
now. While prices for cars, houses and tee shirts have zoomed up
over the years, gadget prices invariably have dropped. (Husted,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHTOOLS _ We gather today to examine a thing called
RadioMouse. RadioMouse is not, as you might think, a mouse with an
AM-FM radio in it, although I'm sure that if one hasn't been
marketed it soon will be. Rather, RadioMouse is another wireless
mouse. It has this small distinction, at least: It's the first
wireless mouse I've tried. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   NETWATCH _ Web sites can help in tracing ancestors. (Katz,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE _ What's new on the Web. This week: For people who
spend most of their working day and some of their personal time
connected to the Internet, the Web becomes part of the daily
routine. Just as someone who travels a lot in the real world _ the
place where it rains and the sun shines _ get to know the
territory, those of us who spend half our waking hours in
cyberspace get to know the territory some. We have sites that are
part of our practical every day working life. For instance, I check
the weather by zapping over to The Weather Channel
(www.weather.com); or for looking up a street address, e-mail
address, or phone number go to Switchboard (www.switchboard.com),
or to find the best way to get to a business across town use
Yahoo!'s excellent mapping service (maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py).
(Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 17. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-MEDIA _ If you fear the Y2K bug, this may be the book for
you. ``Crisis Investing for the year 2000'' is a guide on how to
protect your finances if computers _ especially those on Wall
Street _ start to go haywire after midnight on Jan. 1. ``Preparing
yourself and your investments for Y2K is not the act of a fringe
survivalist,'' say authors L. Jay Kuo and Edward M. Dua in the
promotion blurb on the jacket of their book. ``Such measures are
the practical precautions of an informed realist.'' Here's some of
the authors predictions: Y2K will disrupt time-sensitive industries
such as banking and stock trading; Y2K will hurt companies
dependent on computer automation for making products and companies
dependent on overseas investments will be hurt because most
countries are ill-prepared for the millennium bug. (Haddad, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 14. MOVED.

   MAC-REPORT _ News on Apple and its products. This week: There
are some areas, dare I say it, in which the PC world commands a
lead over Apple Computer technology. One of the more significant is
voice-recognition software, a technology that Apple Computer once
pioneered. But Apple Computer is starting to close the gap, much to
the relief of many Mac users. (Haddad , Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   TECH-REPORT _ Tech briefs on new products and developments. This

Nanny is a rerun and the Braves are on the West Coast. You flip
over to the A&AMP;E channel for relief only to find its ``Accounting
Giants Week'' on Biography. Now, A&AMP;E is giving you a chance to have
a hand in the occasional program selection. Biography is getting
interactive. Until June 1, people can type www.biography.com into
their Web browser and have a little say in what they see. Viewers
will pick the bios shown over the next several months. The
by-demand hour-long shows will start airing Monday, July 12, on the

   ONLINE-GENEALOGY _ Once upon a time, if you wanted to research
your family tree, you had to travel from library to library. But
the Internet is making genealogy a hobby you can pursue from home,

ILLUSTRATION. MOVED.WALKMAN-ANNIVERSARY _ As Sony celebrates the

<P>
   EDS: This is the CoxNet PTECH page for the current week. This
layout is available Tuesday after 2 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   COXNET PTECH 0525 GENEALOGY _ The computer does two things that
make genealogy simpler, more fun and more efficient: It organizes
records, and it links hobbyists through the Internet for the
exchange of ideas and information. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News)
Art includes one 4-column color illustration of a family tree on a
computer chip board.

</P>
<P>
   TECH BRIEFS _ If your child has not taken to reading with the
same enthusiasm and skill as he has taken to video games, there's a
new Web site that might help. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) Art includes one 2-column color photo of a
Web site of Sylban Learning Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY _ Can we have some privacy? That's what folks will
tell you, if you ask about the fears they have of the Internet and
the Web. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) Art includes 1
column color sig of columnist.
</P>
<P>
   TRENDS _ Parents have mixed feelings about kids exploring the
Internet, according to a news study. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) Art includes one 1-column color illustration
of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   DOMAIN-NAMES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The process of registering a
domain name, which is simpler than it used to be, is still not as
effortless as it could be. But soon, it will be a little easier and
likely cheaper if a plan to include more registrars and add new
domain suffixes is successful. (Gallaga, Austin
American-Statesman). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY_ I was thinking about pocket calculators the other
day. I remembered, back in the 1970s, saving up about $400 to buy a
Hewlett Packard calculator. It was an amazing device then. It could
add, multiply and divide, as well as do all sort of math problems
that would have made my high school trig teacher proud. It was a
marvel of the time _ all that power packed into a gizmo small
enough to fit into my jacket pocket. Nowadays, of course, you can
find more powerful pocket calculators for $4 hanging in those
little shrinkwrap packages as you stand in the grocery store
checkout line. That's one of the real marvels of technology _ how
prices drop so fast. Think of any gadget you care to mention _
microwave oven, VCR, color television _ and, if you are old enough,
you'll be struck by how expensive it once was and how cheap it is
now. While prices for cars, houses and tee shirts have zoomed up
over the years, gadget prices invariably have dropped. (Husted,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHTOOLS _ We gather today to examine a thing called
RadioMouse. RadioMouse is not, as you might think, a mouse with an
AM-FM radio in it, although I'm sure that if one hasn't been
marketed it soon will be. Rather, RadioMouse is another wireless
mouse. It has this small distinction, at least: It's the first
wireless mouse I've tried. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
15. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH _ Web sites can help in tracing ancestors. (Katz,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE _ What's new on the Web. This week: For people who
spend most of their working day and some of their personal time
connected to the Internet, the Web becomes part of the daily
routine. Just as someone who travels a lot in the real world _ the
place where it rains and the sun shines _ get to know the
territory, those of us who spend half our waking hours in
cyberspace get to know the territory some. We have sites that are
part of our practical every day working life. For instance, I check
the weather by zapping over to The Weather Channel
(www.weather.com); or for looking up a street address, e-mail
address, or phone number go to Switchboard (www.switchboard.com),
or to find the best way to get to a business across town use
Yahoo!'s excellent mapping service (maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py).
(Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 17. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-MEDIA _ If you fear the Y2K bug, this may be the book for
you. ``Crisis Investing for the year 2000'' is a guide on how to
protect your finances if computers _ especially those on Wall
Street _ start to go haywire after midnight on Jan. 1. ``Preparing
yourself and your investments for Y2K is not the act of a fringe
survivalist,'' say authors L. Jay Kuo and Edward M. Dua in the
promotion blurb on the jacket of their book. ``Such measures are
the practical precautions of an informed realist.'' Here's some of
the authors predictions: Y2K will disrupt time-sensitive industries
such as banking and stock trading; Y2K will hurt companies
dependent on computer automation for making products and companies
dependent on overseas investments will be hurt because most
countries are ill-prepared for the millennium bug. (Haddad, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 14. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MAC-REPORT _ News on Apple and its products. This week: There
are some areas, dare I say it, in which the PC world commands a
lead over Apple Computer technology. One of the more significant is
voice-recognition software, a technology that Apple Computer once
pioneered. But Apple Computer is starting to close the gap, much to
the relief of many Mac users. (Haddad , Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-REPORT _ Tech briefs on new products and developments. This
week: How often has this happened: It's 8 p.m., you realize The
Nanny is a rerun and the Braves are on the West Coast. You flip
over to the A&AMP;E channel for relief only to find its ``Accounting
Giants Week'' on Biography. Now, A&AMP;E is giving you a chance to have
a hand in the occasional program selection. Biography is getting
interactive. Until June 1, people can type www.biography.com into
their Web browser and have a little say in what they see. Viewers
will pick the bios shown over the next several months. The
by-demand hour-long shows will start airing Monday, July 12, on the
8 p.m. A&AMP;E channel series. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 20. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   POWERUSER-COLUMN _ A regular series of columns for advanced
computer users. Not available this week: (Yandel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-GENEALOGY _ Once upon a time, if you wanted to research
your family tree, you had to travel from library to library. But
the Internet is making genealogy a hobby you can pursue from home,
with many resources now online. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). WITH
ILLUSTRATION. MOVED.WALKMAN-ANNIVERSARY _ As Sony celebrates the
30th anniversary of the personal stereo, the Walkman, it introduces
the MZ-R55 portable MiniDisc recorder/player. (Dayton Daily News).

   DOMAIN-NAMES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The process of registering a
domain name, which is simpler than it used to be, is still not as

<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY_ I was thinking about pocket calculators the other
day. I remembered, back in the 1970s, saving up about $400 to buy a
Hewlett Packard calculator. It was an amazing device then. It could
add, multiply and divide, as well as do all sort of math problems
that would have made my high school trig teacher proud. It was a
marvel of the time _ all that power packed into a gizmo small
enough to fit into my jacket pocket. Nowadays, of course, you can
find more powerful pocket calculators for $4 hanging in those
little shrinkwrap packages as you stand in the grocery store
checkout line. That's one of the real marvels of technology _ how
prices drop so fast. Think of any gadget you care to mention _
microwave oven, VCR, color television _ and, if you are old enough,
you'll be struck by how expensive it once was and how cheap it is
now. While prices for cars, houses and tee shirts have zoomed up
over the years, gadget prices invariably have dropped. (Husted,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.

   TECHTOOLS _ We gather today to examine a thing called
RadioMouse. RadioMouse is not, as you might think, a mouse with an
AM-FM radio in it, although I'm sure that if one hasn't been

mouse. It has this small distinction, at least: It's the first
wireless mouse I've tried. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

cyberspace get to know the territory some. We have sites that are
part of our practical every day working life. For instance, I check
the weather by zapping over to The Weather Channel
(www.weather.com); or for looking up a street address, e-mail
address, or phone number go to Switchboard (www.switchboard.com),

yourself and your investments for Y2K is not the act of a fringe
survivalist,'' say authors L. Jay Kuo and Edward M. Dua in the
promotion blurb on the jacket of their book. ``Such measures are
the practical precautions of an informed realist.'' Here's some of
the authors predictions: Y2K will disrupt time-sensitive industries
such as banking and stock trading; Y2K will hurt companies
dependent on computer automation for making products and companies
dependent on overseas investments will be hurt because most
countries are ill-prepared for the millennium bug. (Haddad, Atlanta

RECALL OF SURGICAL SUTURES UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A medical manufacturer retrieved only 2 percent
of about 3.6 million surgical sutures it recalled after the
products allegedly were contaminated with infectious bacteria, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., said the FDA's handling of a
nationwide recall of the Ethicon Corp.'s trademark Vicryl surgical
sutures _ and the low return rate _ made him fear that ``the system
may have failed to protect the health of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last week to Stark and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,
Associate FDA Commissioner Melinda Plaisier said Ethicon had
managed to retrieve only about 76,000 of 3.6 million boxes of
sutures that were processed in a problem-plagued sterilizer at a
Texas factory and then shipped to hospitals and surgeons in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The other 3.5 million sutures presumably had already been used
by the time the recall began, an FDA official said.
</P>
<P>
   An Ethicon spokeswoman said the company believed the FDA may
have misinterpreted its data, contending that about 25 percent _ or
about 900,000 of the sutures _ had been returned in the recall. But
the FDA insisted the numbers were accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In lawsuits and complaints to the FDA, more than 100 patients in
California and eight other states have blamed contaminated Ethicon
sutures for a nationwide outbreak of fierce, debilitating
post-operative infections in 1994 and 1995. The company has denied
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for victims have said they fear that many other people
may also have become infected by the sutures, which in lawsuits
were alleged to have been contaminated with staphylococcus and a
rare bacteria that is related to tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Stark and Waxman last month wrote a tough letter to the FDA
asking pointed questions about the incident and the agency's
supervision of it.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Plaisier for the first time reported the return
rate, 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter she also said Ethicon had destroyed all the
sutures that were returned in the voluntary recall.
</P>
<P>
   Stark and other critics said that will make it far more
difficult to investigate the role of the sutures in the infection
outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the low return rate on the recall and the destruction of
the returned sutures, Plaisier defended the conduct of the company
and the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1994, the FDA issued a warning letter to Ethicon,
faulting the company for continuing to sell sutures after it
discovered its sterilizer unit was malfunctioning. Because of the
sterilization failures, the FDA said it regarded the sutures as
``adulterated'' under terms of federal pure-products laws.
</P>
<P>
   But Plaisier wrote last week that there was no proof sutures had
actually become contaminated, saying the ``FDA considered the
deficiencies to constitute a lack of assurance of sterility, not a
lack of sterility.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there was no proof the sutures were responsible for
the infections, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Odenthal, a spokeswoman for Ethicon, said the FDA letter
supported what the company has said all along _ that there is no
evidence that the sutures caused the postoperative infections the
lawsuits alleged. She said Ethicon was working with the FDA to iron
out the disagreement over the correct number of sutures returned in
the recall.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records and FDA documents, the sutures
problem began in March 1994, when Ethicon, a $1.2 billion Johnson &AMP;
Johnson subsidiary, noted that a new high-tech system for
sterilizing sutures at a plant in San Angelo, Texas, was
malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   In May of that year, Ethicon stopped using the equipment. But no
recall was ordered until September, after prodding from FDA
inspectors who had discovered the problem during a routine
inspection. In the meantime, 3.6 million suspect sutures were on
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ethicon recalled the sutures, it contended the risk of
infection was so slight that there was no reason for doctors who
had used the sutures to warn patients, a company memo shows.

NETWORKS PLAY IT SAFE AGAIN IN FALL LINEUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Them who has, gets.
</P>
<P>
   The adage applies to nothing so much as network TV. To get a
series on the air, it seems, you have to have a series on the air.
</P>
<P>
   So when the network fall schedules were released last week, the
stars' names weren't always familiar, but the producers' names
were.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Wolf, producer of ``Law &AMP; Order,'' has a new show and,
surprise, it's a chip off of ``Law &AMP; Order.''
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kelley, may we kneel and cross ourselves when we say
his name, has two new shows. One is ``Ally,'' ground like sausage
from old ``Ally McBeal'' footage.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on. ``ER'' executive producer John Wells, whose
``Trinity'' was such a smash nonhit last year, has two new shows of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite is Aaron Sorkin. He got ``Sports Night'' on ABC last
fall. It's a good show but still wobbly as a newborn colt. Still,
he and Wells will be producing the new ``West Wing'' this fall for
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   These are talented individuals. But will ``The Practice'' be
better because Kelley is overseeing the production of ``Snoops''?
Doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's because so few people do so many shows, or because
network programmers are basically jackasses, the fall season once
again looks, on paper at least, like any other TV season. And in an
era of hemorrhaging ratings, that doesn't bode well for the old
networks.
</P>
<P>
   There will be 38 new series on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN and the
WB. Five are direct spin-offs of existing shows. Four are cop
shows. At least three are lawyer shows. I gave up trying to count
how many will be about young people afoot in New York. Let's just
say too many.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be expected to remember that ``Now &AMP; Again'' is CBS and
``Once &AMP; Again'' is ABC. Neither is to be confused with Jane
Pauley's ``Time &AMP; Again'' on MSNBC. But go ahead anyway, if you
must.
</P>
<P>
   There's ``Grown Ups'' on UPN and ``Oh Grow Up'' on ABC, and I'm
making a wild guess that neither show is especially for grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is to say, the networks are repeating themselves
more than a burping babe. The same old same-old.
</P>
<P>
   One trend is more promising, dramatically. Three new shows are
set in high schools; interestingly, the networks finalized their
schedules in the immediate wake of the Columbine High School
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   It's not simply that ``Freaks and Geeks,'' ``Popularity'' and
``Manchester Prep'' will be centered in high schools. It's that
they may be poised to tackle the sorts of teen issues that erupted
in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   More early indications for the fall season:
</P>
<P>
   _ Business plans do change at UPN. Last year its executives
argued that they were standing forthrightly for the principle of
general, broad-based entertainment, and damn the demographics. In
the fall UPN will program for adolescent males, with pro wrestling
leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   _ African Americans have been slighted again, as badly as in the
1950s. Only UPN continues to take a stab at this increasingly
neglected audience. The bigger networks are snow-white for the
fall. And even Fox has put ``The PJs'' into storage until midseason
next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ It may be tougher for NBC to hold Thursdays together. ABC,
Fox, UPN and the WB are showing signs of a fighting spirit, and
they might smell blood. ``Friends,'' ``Frasier'' and ``ER'' will be
one year older. ``Jesse'' will be one year dumber, and ``Stark
Raving Mad'' will be new. Take NBC down on Thursday and the peacock
is stew meat.
</P>
<P>
   _ All the networks except CBS will ignore anyone whose physical
age is past 49 and whose mental age is beyond 15. And doesn't CBS
seem a mite arthritic? You just can't win.
</P>
<P>
   _ Half-hour sitcoms have become so stale that even the networks
are sick of them. Fewer than half of the new shows are comedies, a
big reversal from past seasons. By year's end some of us will be
complaining that we just can't digest another TV drama.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where are the risk-takers? Hiding in the bushes, waiting until
midseason. Practically every delicate se ries in development has
been held off the air until after the annual autumn slaughter. More
and more, it's evident that September is the most dangerous time to
put a new show on the air.
</P>
<P>
   _ Care for an interesting time slot? Personally, I like 9:30
p.m. Wednesdays, when new shows will be on four of the six networks
_ and CBS will be running a movie.
</P>
<P>
   _ These titles might say something malicious about the times.
Consider: ``Harsh Realm,'' ``Cold Feet,'' ``Odd Man Out,''
``Smackdown!,'' ``Get Real,'' ``Shasta McNasty,'' ``Oh Grow Up,''
``Wasteland.'' Geez, it's enough to make someone adore ``Safe
Harbor,'' if only for its name.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking of titles, no way should ``Ryan Caulfield'' be a cop
show. It sounds way, way too much like ``Holden Caulfield.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Frustrated by the mystery of the gamma ray bursts,
cryptic messages from what must be the most violent events in the
universe, astrophysicists have for the last 30 years had reason to
envy the certitude of Clarence Oddbody, George Bailey's guardian
angel in the evergreen movie ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarence had no trouble deciphering the signals of one
particular kind of transforming event in the heavens. ``Any time a
bell rings,'' he told George, ``it means an angel just got his
wings.''
</P>
<P>
   It may well be, astrophysicists now think, that the sudden,
random and faraway flashes of gamma radiation also are cosmic
proclamations, but of a secular kind. The enormous blasts of energy
seem to be birth announcements of another phenomenon of awesome
power, one predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity but
shrouded in mystery because no light can escape the dark clutches
of its consuming gravity.
</P>
<P>
   If current hypotheses are correct, Dr. Tsvi Piran of Columbia
University said at a four-day symposium at the Space Telescope
Science Institute here this month, ``each gamma ray burst is
signaling the creation of a new black hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Introducing one enigmatic phenomenon, black holes, to explain
another may not seem like progress. Definitive knowledge of black
holes is scant because they cannot be observed directly, though
their existence and behavior are inferred from the powerful effects
they have on surrounding matter. And about all astronomers have
been able to say for sure about gamma ray bursts is that they occur
in the cosmic deep on an average of once a day, but never in the
same place twice, and appear to be thousands of times more powerful
than ordinary exploding stars, known as supernovas.
</P>
<P>
   But recent observations have led scientists to believe their
theories are on target in linking black holes to gamma ray bursts.
They suspect there may be more than one type of these bursts, but
in all cases a relatively small black hole is presumably the
primary energy source.
</P>
<P>
   One idea involves the collapse of a massive star, many times the
heft of the sun, into a rapidly spinning black hole, triggering the
blast of gamma radiation. Another possibility is the merger of two
neutron stars, superdense relics of exploded stars, which creates a
black hole with explosive consequences. Or a neutron star and a
black hole, orbiting each other, could collide to create a larger
black hole and a similar cataclysm.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Martin Rees, a theoretical astrophysicist at Cambridge
University in England, said the evidence implicating black holes
had strengthened over the last two years, largely because
astronomers had for the first time been able to observe the
immediate afterglow of some of these bursts in X-ray, radio and
visible wavelengths. The bursts last only a few seconds in gamma
rays, but leave more long-lived radiations in other wavelengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge now is to fill in the detail,'' Rees said, and
spacecraft working in tandem with ground-based telescopes are
making a promising start, with improved observatories in the
offing.

   In January, alerted by spacecraft detections of intense surges
of X-rays and gamma rays, automated telescopes on the ground swung
into action to get the first images in visible light of a gamma ray
burst in progress. Other observations soon followed in both visible
and radio wavelengths. Studies of the data have yielded new clues
to the dynamics of the bursts and confirmation that astronomers are
not exaggerating when they describe them as the largest explosions
in the universe, second only to the Big Bang at the theorized birth
of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers are now busy studying another especially bright
burst detected on May 10 by spacecraft and then observed in visual
light at ground telescopes, including the new European Southern
Observatory telescope at Cerro Paranal in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   In the April 27 issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, Dr. Dieter Hartmann of Clemson University in South
Carolina said research in gamma ray bursts ``is currently in a
supercharged phase, with progress occurring rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although gamma rays are the most powerful form of
electromagnetic radiation, with energies far exceeding X-rays,
those of cosmic origin cannot penetrate Earth's atmosphere.
Explosions of thermonuclear bombs, however, do emit copious gamma
rays into the atmosphere. The first cosmic gamma ray bursts were
thus discovered accidentally in 1968 by an American Vela
spacecraft, which was monitoring compliance with a treaty banning
nuclear tests in the upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The detections remained a cosmic oddity until 1991, when NASA
launched the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Its instruments
established how common the bursts are, recording some 350 of the
transient surges of energy each year. They seemed to be popping off
everywhere, but they faded fast and could not be correlated with
any known celestial objects observed in other wavelengths _ no star
or galaxy, no stellar explosion or observed black-hole region.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came the Italian-Dutch BeppoSax satellite, launched
in 1996. It not only detected the original bursts of gamma rays,
but also associated flashes of X-rays. Because the X-rays are more
focused, the satellite could pinpoint their place of origin in the
sky. Astronomers thus knew where to look for any object in the
region that could be the source of the blast.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, astronomers have been able to estimate distances to
these events, confirming that they occur well beyond the Milky Way,
Earth's home galaxy. Some are at least two-thirds of the way across
the universe. Being so luminous at such great distances confirmed
that the gamma ray bursts indeed bear messages from explosions of
previously unimagined power.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers estimated that the burst detected in January,
designated GRB990123, was 10 times as luminous as the brightest one
seen before. At first, some observers suspected that this might be
an illusion. Perhaps the radiations were being magnified beyond
their true strength by the lensing effects of intervening galaxies.
At the symposium, scientists reported that further analysis
dispelled that idea.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The distances also mean that these are events that occurred very
early in the universe, making them even more fascinating to
scientists. Their timing and nature, astrophysicists said, suggest
that the bursts may be associated with the periods of more prolific
star formation in the universe's youth. Many of the bursts have
been detected in dusty star-formation environments.
</P>
<P>
   As probes of the early universe, Rees said, ``the bursts may be
a way to use the universe as a laboratory to test fundamental
physics, short of the Big Bang itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a closer look at observations last year of a peculiar and
extremely powerful supernova, SN1998bw, astronomers noted that it
appeared to coincide in time and location with a gamma ray burst.
The two could be different manifestations of a single explosive
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got everyone excited,'' said Dr. Shrinivas Kulkarni of
the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. It suggested
that the collapse of massive stars responsible for supernovas could
in some cases form a black hole and other conditions setting off a
blast of gamma radiation as, in Kulkarni's expression, ``the dying
cries of massive stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Garnavich, a supernova astronomer at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.,
reported that the supernova was at least 10 times as energetic as
others of its type and might not be a rare phenomenon. Five such
curiously powerful exploding stars have been studied in the last
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large energy required to understand'' the possible
supernova-gamma ray burst pair, Hartmann of Clemson wrote, ``is in
contrast to generic expectations for the explosion of such massive
stars and suggests a new class of stellar explosions:
collapstars.''
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists were reserving judgment on a connection
between some supernovas and gamma ray bursts, Dr. Mario Livio of
the space telescope institute said of the suspect SN1998bw:
``Nature would have to be truly malicious to put it in the same
region of sky with a gamma ray burst for them not to be related.
More and more pieces of evidence indicate that these two phenomena
are related.''
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle over these unusual supernovas goes to the heart of
the issue. As Kulkarni said: ``The most interesting question is
what forms these things. What is the central engine? That is the
big mystery of the gamma ray bursts.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists note two apparent differences in the gamma ray
bursts. Some erupt in only brief flashes, less than five seconds.
These are detected by the Compton Observatory, but do not last long
enough to be picked up by BeppoSax, which begins registering bursts
only after five seconds. This is the basis for the suspicion that
there are different kinds of burst dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists think the longer bursts result from the massive-star
collapses related to extremely energetic supernovas, and the
shorter ones stem from neutron-star mergers or neutron star
collision with black holes. The result, in any case, is a black
hole that sets in motion a rapid sequence of events.
</P>
<P>
   In what he calls the ``best-buy model,'' Rees of Cambridge
pictured a rapidly spinning black hole with a mass of no more than
three to five times that of the Sun. (Supermassive black holes at
the center of some galaxies, the true ogres of the universe, are
dense regions with estimated masses several hundred million times
the Sun's.) The black hole is surrounded by powerful magnetic
fields and a doughnut-shaped disk, or torus, of debris from the
star collapse or neutron star collision.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the symposium described what probably happens
next, in a matter of seconds. Much of the debris falls toward the
black hole, releasing enormous amounts of energy and matter. As an
effect of the rotating black hole and torus, the ejecta probably
travels outward in a narrow jet perpendicular to the torus. If this
is true, and scientists say the circumstantial evidence is strong,
it would mean that a gamma ray burst is not equally bright in all
directions, but concentrates its energy in a beam. That, in turn,
would mean that the total energy output of the bursts is not as
great as first thought, though still enough to be nature's most
powerful explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Internal shocks within the ejecta presumably trigger the initial
gamma ray burst. As the gamma rays encounter the interstellar
medium, more shock waves leave the lingering afterglow of X-rays,
radio waves and visible light shining as bright as a million normal
galaxies. The afterglow can be studied for hours and, in some
cases, days.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are looking to a pair of new spacecraft to provide
more comprehensive observations of the burst phenomenon and
rigorous tests of their theories.
</P>
<P>
   In January, NASA plans to launch the HETE, for Hyper-Energy
Transient Explorer, satellite to make rapid X-ray observations
identifying the location of each gamma burst. The agency is also
weighing a proposal for a satellite to be called Swift, which would
be put in orbit in 2003. Its instruments would make simultaneous
observations in gamma ray, X-ray and visual wavelengths, with
greater sensitivity and frequency than current capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means certain that, even then, astrophysicists will
be explaining gamma ray bursts with the same assurance as a
Clarence speaking of bells tolling for newly fledged angels.

SOME SHAPE UP BY SURFING THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The (AT) word at end of story should be replaced with the
symbol)  
 (af)  
 By MARION ROACH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For various reasons, including a busy schedule and two herniated
discs in my neck, I got out of shape. Or, more specifically, I got
into another shape altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last fall, while doing Internet research for a story on
these pages about women's bodybuilding, I stumbled onto a site
named trulyhuge.com. What this site was selling seemed highly
unlikely. Here was fitness on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Online training? Let's be serious. Sure, you can get anything on
the Internet. But fit? I didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   These are the words of a changed woman. Seventeen pounds
lighter, sleeping through the night for the first time in my life,
energetic, fit and strong, I am the worst kind of proselytizer _
worse, by far, than the reformed smoker, recovering carbo-loader or
even politician. I know online fitness when I see it. And I've seen
it.
</P>
<P>
   One search through the Web reveals that the Internet is awash
with gymnasts and fitness competitors, bodybuilders, coaches and
trainers willing to sign up clients for online fitness. But
TrulyHuge is the one I chose.
</P>
<P>
   TrulyHuge had a questionnaire that required measuring my height
and the size of my body everywhere from my ankles to my wrists. It
asked about injuries, access to a gym, pool, weights or any other
athletic equipment. I started filling in the boxes on the screen
and noticed that I hadn't been tempted to lie. Not for my weight,
height, bad habits or goals.
</P>
<P>
   There was something about not being seen by the recipient of
these statistics that allowed me to tell the full-sized truth. I
think that's when I became intrigued. Already this was a step up
from my last personal training experience: No pep talks, no pitches
for products I wouldn't feed my septic system and, especially, no
welterweight endomorph lashing my middleweight self with tape
measures. That means no onsite humiliation. Online humiliation? Who
cares?
</P>
<P>
   I wrote that my goals were to lose 15 pounds, increase my
aerobic stamina, get back into my clothes (that is, get smaller,
not bulk up with muscle), feel better and get a little more energy.
I didn't ask about sleep. As a lifelong insomniac, it never
occurred to me to include it in my goals.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``comments'' box, I wrote that my dream workout would be
portable, allowing me to keep up my routine at the gym, at my home
in the country (where I have nothing but a few hand weights) and on
the road. Being a writer, wife and mother, I have a haphazard
schedule, one prone to constant interruption.
</P>
<P>
   This had helped me to fail with personal trainers before:
Keeping those appointments was hard, and, I admit, paying for them
when I canceled was even harder. After I moved upstate, I
discovered that the going rate for a personal trainer was only $20
an hour, much less than what I had been paying in Manhattan and, in
fact, less than in any major metropolis I know.
</P>
<P>
   But that's still hefty enough if you train three times a week
for the length of time it takes to get in shape, which I figured in
my case would be a minimum of eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   So I signed up for TrulyHuge for 12 weeks, hoping that at the
end of it I might be truly small. The total cost was $60. That's
right: $20 a month for a planned diet, a training regimen and
coaching online. This includes unlimited questions on the client's
part and regular check-ins from the trainer.
</P>
<P>
   The man on the other side of TrulyHuge is Paul Becker, who
trains bodybuilders in and around L.A. along with running the Web
site, which features products, promotes his training and sells his
book, ``TrulyHuge.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two days of my returning the questionnaire, my complete
diet and exercise routine arrived by e-mail. It was portable. It
accommodated gym, home and even hotel room workouts. The dietary
recommendations were for a higher protein/lower carbohydrate
routine and included sample menus.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed I had been drinking too much juice and not enough
water. He also advised me that there was too much bread in my diet.
These are not hard things to alter. His recommended eating regimen
_ sensible, understandable and do-able _ called, for example, for
an egg-white omelet in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   I don't eat eggs, so now I have a fruit shake with tofu, soy
powder or skim milk every morning.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to track my progress efficiently, I waited until the
first day of a new month to go back to the gym. And when it came, I
went, armed with nothing more than three pieces of paper from
TrulyHuge and my workout clothes, I was ready.
</P>
<P>
   My program required five days of 30-minute aerobic workouts each
week plus three strength sessions. The three strength workouts were
to be rotated, with one or two day's rest advised between each. The
aerobic exercise recommended was power walking, which I decided to
do on a treadmill at the gym. All the exercises, I was instructed,
were to be done in sets of 15 repetitions unless otherwise stated.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The three strength days broke down as follows: Day one, two sets
of leg presses, one set of leg extensions, two sets each of leg
curls, seated calf raises and as many reverse crunches as possible.
Day two, two sets of bench presses, one set of incline bench
presses, one set of flies, two sets of lateral raises, one set of
bent over lateral raises, one set of french presses, one set of
triceps pulldowns and as many reverse crunches as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Day three, two sets of rowing, one set of lat pulldowns, one set
of standing barbell curls, one set of incline dumbbell curls, one
set of wrist curls, one set each of reverse wrist curls and reverse
crunches.
</P>
<P>
   The freehand program, or what I call the at-home/on-the-road
workout, included push-ups, deep knee bends, calf raises, side leg
raises and reverse crunches.
</P>
<P>
   By the night of day four I had the sensation that my legs were
humming. Lying in bed (not sleeping, of course) my legs seemed to
be vibrating. I wrote to my trainer. Paul replied to my online
query within hours. My legs, he said, were burning fat. I was
hopeful. By the end of the second week, I had lost three pounds.
Was I naive to have hoped for more?
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half weeks into the program, I had dropped four
pounds. I e-mailed this progress to TrulyHuge, and Paul wrote me an
encouraging note saying I was doing great. I requested a more
thorough explanation of the free weight routines. By the end of the
day, I had received a completely understandable breakdown of the
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weeks, if I didn't e-mail, Paul did. He asked for
progress reports or inquired to see if I had questions. I came to
appreciate the reminder that someone out there was keeping track of
my progress. Weight loss and training, I found out, is not
something most friends and relations find terribly interesting.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 days, I cut out all alcohol but did nothing else to
alter the program. Two weeks after that, I started sleeping. No,
more than that: I did eight straight hours asleep, for the first
time in my life. And every night since I have simply gone right to
sleep _ face down, face up, it makes no difference. My husband
swears that once he thought I was dead. He managed to wake me, but,
no matter, I went right back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   That month I lost five more pounds. But I was frustrated. I had
hoped for two pounds a week. So, I partook of that time-honored,
well-known weight loss motivator: I got an expensive haircut. Eight
more pounds were gone by the end of the next month.
</P>
<P>
   I e-mailed Paul Becker and told him how pleased I was: 17 pounds
gone in less than three months. I am very pleased to be going into
June without that weight. But I had to ask one more question: Why
was I sleeping?
</P>
<P>
   He used an old English measure, one of those forgotten measures
like ``peck'' and ``fathom'' in his e-mail reply. And it was
comforting to see it in this digital age, so I've kept it tacked on
my wall: ``Lose a stone (14 pounds),'' it said, ``Sleep like a
rock.'' He's right.
</P>
<P>
   The Next Step
</P>
<P>
   Online trainers abound on the Web. While prices vary, expect to
pay at least $20 for a one-month workout. This should include
unlimited questions from you to the trainer and replies, but will
not include any nutritional supplements or books.

CIVILIANS SUFFER AS NATO INTENSIFIES ATTACKS ON SERBIAN UTILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In the Belgrade suburb of Zemun Monday
morning, people were complaining that even McDonald's did not have
coffee, because there was no water and no electricity.
</P>
<P>
   In Kovin, a small town in the northern province of Vojvodina,
there is no power for the air-raid sirens. So the populace is
relying for warnings on the church bells, which are rung with
pauses, in an imitation of the broken sound of an air alert here.
</P>
<P>
   Branislav Grbic described with fury how he had to make a
fireplace out of broken bricks in his Belgrade courtyard to heat
milk for his baby son and grill the chicken in his freezer, before
it spoiled. ``This is nearly the 21st century, and they force us to
live like cavemen,'' he said. ``Slobo,'' he said, referring to the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, ``has plenty of power and
water, and so does the army.''
</P>
<P>
   After two months of bombing, which began March 24, NATO is going
after Serbia's electricity and water supplies in a serious way. The
high-explosive bombs are doing permanent damage to both systems,
considered essentials of modern civilian life.
</P>
<P>
   People are buying up batteries and bottled water and boiling
eggs, when they do have a little electricity, so they will have
something to eat in the long, dark, powerless nights, when the
planes come again and anti-aircraft fire is the only light in the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity supply is intermittent for even the luckiest,
while workers struggle to provide emergency power to hospitals,
bakeries and the water company. But the hospitals are having the
most trouble finding enough water to bathe patients and to
sterilize equipment; the city is attempting to supply them with
water trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Without power to run the pumps, many urban dwellers have no
running water _ and if they have water, they have little hot water,
since most dwellings have electric water heaters. City officials
say Belgrade is down to less than 10 percent of its water reserves
because it cannot filter new supplies. They say that only 30
percent of residents, mostly in low-lying areas, have any running
water.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity cuts, which have been temporary in the past,
intensified with new NATO attacks on Saturday morning. As the
national electricity grid, EPS, has begun to restore power, NATO
has attacked it again and again. The company urged consumers to be
patient, saying that NATO has hit Serbia's five major transmitting
plants, including plants at Obrenovac, Kostolac and Kolubara.
</P>
<P>
   The largest democratic opposition party, the Serbian Renewal
Movement, led by Vuk Draskovic, issued a scathing attack Monday on
NATO's targeting of power and water plants, calling the bombing of
these public services ``collective retaliation'' and ``crimes
against the civilian population.'' The party called for quick
action by the U.N. Security Council, European Union and
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to intervene to
stop attacks on these utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation requires an urgent reaction by major
international institutions, rather than a slow diplomatic process,
since a flagrant violation of all international norms and customs
of war is happening before the eyes of the entrie world,'' the
party said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Democratic Party, whose leader, Zoran Djindjic,
has been attacked as a traitor by the regime, said that cutting
electricity would produce needless deaths of the innocent, the very
young and very old. ``Such attacks are particularly unreasonable at
a time when diplomatic activity is being stepped up and there is a
chance to find a solution,'' the party said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian special envoy for the Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
was to arrive Monday to discuss a possible peace settlement, but
now will not come until Thursday, so he can have further talks with
the American deputy secretary of state, Strobe Talbott, and the
Finnish president, Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts here said they assumed that NATO was intensifying
both its attacks and its language as a way to force a diplomatic
endgame on Milosevic and to press him to sign a less favorable deal
to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   But Jadranka Djordjevic, a 64-year-old Belgrade resident who
used to work for the American Embassy here, is caustic about such
an assumption. ``If NATO wants to overturn the government this is
not the way to do it,'' she said. ``Bombing has never had that
result anywhere in the world. I am absolutely certain this will not
make people revolt against their government _ they will revolt
against whoever is doing this to them. NATO is terrorizing six
million civilians in large cities in Yugoslavia. Making people's
lives miserable is not solving any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Djordjevic was 6 years old in 1941, when the Nazis bombed
Belgrade, and she remembers the Allied bombing of the city in 1944.
``Our generation is well-trained in war,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother always had salt, flour and dried yeast in the house
at all times. I have 100 liters of water in my apartment now. Of
course, then we had wood stoves. My mother always implored me not
to get rid of our wood stove. And I still have it in the pantry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   She has no stock of wood, Ms. Djordjevic said. ``But as a last
resort I can use my parquet floor. In fact I think it could come to
that this winter.''
</P>
<P>
   She lives in downtown Belgrade, on the second floor, and a
relative who lives in an eighth-floor apartment in the newer part
of the city has moved in with her. ``Of course, we all worry about
our freezers and how long the food will stay safe to eat,'' she
said. ``The problem is that for most of us, that food is now worth
a fortune. We can't replace it if we have to throw it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Djordjevic, who worked at the embassy for much of her
career, is extremely bitter about this war. ``I worked for 30 years
to elevate relations between our two countries and they were
destroyed in two days of bombing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Will the new difficulties affect the way Serbs think about
Kosovo? ``People now think of survival, of keeping old ones warm
and the little ones safe,'' she said. ``It's exhausting. When you
have to fear for your survival, you don't think politics. You just
get angry at people who want to make you live like cavemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Djordjevic also had some choice words for President Clinton
and his wife, Hillary, who said the plight of Kosovo refugees
reminded her of Holocaust scenes in the Steven Spielberg film
``Schindler's List'': ``People who learn history from Spielberg
movies should not tell us how to live our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook. ``I've heard
he's said that this might make people rise against the regime,''
she said. ``If he really said that, it means he's a terrorist and
should be put on trial by the International Court of Justice in The
Hague. You cannot terrorize civilians in this way. We are talking
about millions of people here who are deprived of basic
necessities.''

`THE LONG WALK': NELSON MANDELA A MAN, LEADER AND LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: Broadcast notes appear at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(ms) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title ``legend'' is generously handed around these days,
used especially in television as a synonym for the hour's
celebrity. So calling Nelson Mandela a legend is an inadequate
tribute. Careful though he is of his image, he also guards his
privacy and is too aloof to pander to the tabloids. Even many who
acclaim him as an authentic hero of our time know little about him
other than that he was held as a prisoner of apartheid for almost
three decades and that on his release in 1990 instantly became his
nation's pre-eminent politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Long Walk of Nelson Mandela,'' Tuesday night's two-hour
offering from ``Frontline,'' digs into his character, particularly
as revealed by his behavior on Robben Island during his
imprisonment. His warders and his comrades agree on the commanding
position that he assumed despite being cut off from the struggle
that was taking place in South Africa's black townships. When the
time came for negotiations, it was Mandela who was recognized as
the most credible negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Born into a royal house of a tribal clan, the young Mandela was
recruited into the black cause by Walter Sisulu, a rising figure of
the African National Congress. Given his imposing stature, his
aristocratic mien and his defiant attitude, Mandela was tapped as a
leader among the black elite. He was also something of a ladies
man, and his rocky love affair with Winnie Madikizela, who became
his wife and a controversial political figure, is reported in
considerable detail. It would prove an excruciating embarrassment
for a man who so valued his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961 Mandela moved from his advocacy of nonviolence to
sabotage. His bombs brought him the title of ``Black Pimpernel.''
When he was captured, he used his defense to attack the system. ``I
am a black man in a white man's court,'' he announced, and was duly
sentenced with other underground leaders to life imprisonment.

   On Robben Island, largely cut off from the outside world, he led
what a fellow prisoner calls ``a war of nerves'' against the
authorities. As the prisoner described it: ``Mandela made the
point, if they say you must run, insist on walking. If they say you
must walk fast, insist on walking slowly.'' He protested against
every indignity, and over time, restrictions were relaxed, his
status affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations between the increasingly embattled white
rulers, who found themselves unable to contain the violence in the
townships, and Mandela, who was accused by some comrades of selling
out, makes for an especially illuminating part of the program. His
canny analysis of the whites' predicament and his autocratic
negotiating style carried the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Long Walk'' ends with a description of the 1995 Rugby
World Cup final in Johannesburg, where tens of thousands of white
fans greeted their country's new leader with shouts of ``Nelson!''
For Mandela, wearing a team jersey, it was a moment of triumphant
reconciliation. As for the problems facing South Africa under his
successors, they are left for future reports.

 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In H.G. Wells' novel ``The Time Machine,'' a flourishing, modern
civilization is maintained by an unseen underground tribe that
carries out its work behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   While the parallel is inexact, the story has similarities in the
real world of medical research, where the visible edifice of
university and medical center laboratories is supported by
committees with an unassuming title but a crucial responsibility.
The committees, institutional review boards, are the people charged
with insuring the safety and ethics of experiments on human beings.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, these boards are a legacy of the revelations of
science run amok in Hitler's Germany and the widespread disgust at
the Tuskegee syphilis study and the like. The committees' job is
not only to prevent this kind of ethical disaster, but also to
protect human experimental subjects in more mundane ways, like
insuring that they understand their rights and that they have
formally consented to experiments.
</P>
<P>
   As the pace of pharmaceutical development increases, these
boards are finding their work increasing. And the federal agency
that oversees them, the Office of Protection from Research Risks,
is moving with new aggressiveness to monitor IRB performance.
</P>
<P>
   The members of these boards _ scientists, ethicists and
patients' representatives _ are unpaid and work several hours a
week, plus attend monthly meetings that may run four to six hours.
They have little staff to help them. Their work is highly technical
and specialized, but for the most part they must train themselves.
And, according to various estimates, they are expected to review
300 to 2,000 proposed experiments per year, with each experiment
documented in hundreds of pages of material.
</P>
<P>
   But should something go wrong in the basement rooms where these
committees meet, the whole multimillion-dollar research enterprise
can come to a humiliating, expensive halt, as Duke University
Medical Center discovered this month when federal regulators
briefly suspended the university's license to conduct human
experiments _ all 2,000 of them _ because it had violated ethics
and safety rules.
</P>
<P>
   Duke was the third major research institution in six months to
have its work suspended, and the director of the federal ethics
office, Gary Ellis, said in an interview last week that half a
dozen other university research programs were under investigation.
At least a couple of the inquiries had turned up serious problems,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Korn, senior vice president of the American
Association of Medical Colleges, which represents major research
universities and medical centers, saidthe Duke case showed the
heightened concern, at least in Washington, about experiments on
humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is talk that new legislation might be necessary,'' he
said. ``There is a real ferment, and the question raised is, can
IRBs do what is expected of them _ that is, protect subjects of
experiments.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said it was too early to tell what action the office would
take as a result of the investigations. After all, his office
itself has few investigators and staff members and for years has
worked with university officials largely through cooperation and
cajoling.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been pressure building to change the system in
some way, at least to expand the number of review boards and give
them more resources. The toughest critics suggest that more
fundamental reform is necessary, because reviews of the system have
found significant problems.
</P>
<P>
   One of the keys to IRB operation, and a common source of
trouble, is the informed-consent statement that patients must sign
to indicate that they have been told the risks of the experiments
and are still willing to participate. The Office of Protection from
Research Risks has frequently found that informed-consent papers
understate or misstate the risks.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst cases, such as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment,
subjects were not told that treatment would be withheld so that
researchers could observe the course of the disease. In more recent
experiments, patients have not been told that the purpose of a
study was to induce symptoms and monitor them. Instead, they have
been told only that they might suffer symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``While factually correct, that is a blatant
misrepresentation,'' said Leonard Glantz, a professor of health law
at the Boston University School of Public Health, and a longtime
IRB member.
</P>
<P>
   Among the groups that have found the system in need of reform
have been the President's National Bioethics Advisory Committee,
the President's Committee on Radiation Experiments, the Department
of Health and Human Services Inspector General, Congress' General
Accounting Office and the Institute of Medicine at the National
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   As the Journal of the American Medical Association said in an
1996 editorial after an federal investigation of past wartime
radiation experiments and of current IRB practices, ``never before
has such a pressure-cooker atmosphere prevailed within the IRB
system, leading government officials, university administrators,
research sponsors and IRB members to wonder whether the IRB system
will crack or reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one keeps track officially, the General Accounting
Office has estimated that 16,000 to 20,000 experiments on an
unknown number of people are conducted in the United States each
year. And the number and complexity of studies, which might involve
dozens to thousands of participants, appear to be rising sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association
reports that in the late 1970s, 30 separate human trials were done
for each new drug application sent to the Food and Drug
Administration. A trial is a study in which a new drug is tested
against an existing drug in varying numbers of patients.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, 68 trials were conducted per drug application. The
number of patients in the experiments has also shot up _ from about
1,600 for each drug application filed in the late 1970s, to 4,250
per application by 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And these numbers do not include all the other scientific
research involving human subjects, such as psychiatric or
behavioral studies, which may account for half of all human
research.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In the Duke case, federal investigators found, for example, that
some informed-consent documents had failed to give subjects full
information about what they would undergo. They found that the IRB
did not follow up to see if any harm had come to patients. They
found meetings convened and votes taken without a quorum present,
and found that two of the board members were top officers of the
university's grants and contracts office _ officials who have a
vested interest in approval of the research. In all, 20 violations
were found.
</P>
<P>
   The response to the growing burden on institutional review
boards has varied from place to place. At Duke, until federal
investigators stepped in, the burden just kept growing. There was
no full-time administrator or staff to review 2,000 experiments.
But at a far smaller research center, the University of Texas at
San Antonio, the board has a full-time administrator and four staff
members to help it review only 300 to 400 studies per year, said
Dr. Herman Wigodsky, a former chairman of the IRB there.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Protection from Research Risks, which has been in
operation since May 1974, carries a caseload of 80 to 120
investigations at a time. That is about four times the number it
handled in its first year of operation. Many more cases might be
opened as complaints about abuses continue to stream in _ some from
patients but most from medical center staff members _ especially
after highly publicized incidents like the suspension of research
at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency has the equivalent of only three full-time
employees to monitor 16,000 to 20,000 human experiments _ a
workload that Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., called ``pathetic''
in congressional hearings on IRB's last year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, more than just the number of human experiments
has increased. There has also been an increase in complaints,
debates and public scrutiny. The biggest attention-getting event,
one that produced a flood of reports to investigate, said Ellis,
was the work of the President's Commission on Human Radiation
Experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that people had a lot of complaints about
radiation,'' Ellis said, ``but people just became aware that they
had a place to turn.'' He said his office was ``experiencing a
25-year peak in interest and action regarding the protection of
human subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   As scientists face the bad publicity associated with the
discovery of ethics violations, there has been debate about whether
the problems found are largely ``administrative housekeeping'' or
are a signal that patients are being harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no actual compilation of patients hurt by
experiments, the amount of harm _ from side effects of drugs to
death caused by experimental methods _ cannot accurately be
assessed. Very few harmful events are reported to the Office of
Protection from Research Risks. ``They appear to be considerably
underreported,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   The system depends not on tracking harm, but on devising
well-planned experiments that assure reasonable safety. That means
record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some discussion about whether what happens in
some of these instances is just housekeeping or is serious,'' Ellis
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, rules require that at least one nonscientist be
present for every IRB action. ``If the IRB meeting minutes don't
show the presence and voting of that member, then there is just no
way to know whether this requirement has been satisfied,'' he said.
``That is more substance than housekeeping, I'd say.''
</P>
<P>
   Korn of the American Association of Medical Colleges
acknowledged that there was much chagrin on the part of medical
researchers about rules that seem overly burdensome and apparently
unnecessary. ``But we have no choice,'' he said. ``If we want
people to trust us, and if we want to be able to carry on with this
work, we must do this right. It is the way the system is set up.''

WARD JUST REFLECTS ON THE DELUSIONS OF PEOPLE AND NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ No place is more gray than Berlin in winter, a layered
gray that begins in the sky, permeates the air, penetrates the
buildings and gathers with bottomless intensity in the city's
lakes. It is a grayness that Ward Just, the novelist, calls ``an
atmosphere,'' and in atmospheres lie the germ of his imaginative
voyages.
</P>
<P>
   One recently began here as Just gazed at the metal-gray waters
of the Wannsee. An icy wind was blowing over the lake. On the far
shore, just visible, was the villa where SS officers led by
Reinhard Heydrich gathered in January 1942 to decide the ``final
solution'' _ the extermination of European Jews. Out on the lake
two middle-aged men were furiously rowing a double scull against
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what do you make of that?'' the author said, pulling an
unfiltered Camel from a packet in the breast pocket of his rumpled
tweed jacket and lighting it slowly. ``Colder than hell. Drizzle
coming down. Never seen a gray like it. That sinister villa. Two
German guys, aged 50 or so, battling the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Just smiled: he likes such conundrums. ``That's enough for me _
a situation, an atmosphere, a vision. I never begin with a plot.
The hell with a plot. But with time, with patience, the thing
reveals itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing does indeed. After 12 novels, reflections on the
delusions of people and nations and the sometimes permanent damage
they suffer, it is safe to say that Just will draw much from that
image of the dogged rowers. On the pain of Germany, its midcentury
catastrophe, its ineluctable battle with memory, its sullen
determination and belief in itself, its discipline, its Romantic
attraction to nature's unassuaged forces, its eternal mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Characters will appear out of all this, a story, even a plot of
sorts, that trace how the wounds of place and personality overlap
at Europe's bitter heart.
</P>
<P>
   Just, who is 62, has just left Berlin after a winterlong sojourn
to be in the United States for the publication this month of his
most recent novel, ``A Dangerous Friend'' (Peter Davison/Houghton
Mifflin). It is set in Vietnam, where Just worked as a
correspondent for The Washington Post from late 1965 to mid-1967,
discovering the themes of love, duty, honor, loyalty,
self-delusion, chaos and uprootedness that have since obsessed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was useless for journalism after Vietnam,'' he said simply.
``I knew I was not going to do any better work.''
</P>
<P>
   But the experience of Vietnam stayed with him after he quit
newspapering a few years later, informing his novels. As he wrote
in ``The Translator,'' his own favorite work, published in 1991:
``Every man had to test himself, and if he was courageous and lucky
he found maturity. That was all the reward you could ask for, or
were entitled to: growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is a game for adults in all of Just's work, serious
business. He tackles the big themes. War, of course, but also the
other battles _ for power (be it in Chicago's Loop or the Cold
War's corridors), for money and for some balance between passion
and love. His approach is disarming. Simple sentences build
inexorably to pin the reader, with a shocking abruptness, in a
charged web. There is something of the soldier's implacability in
Just's prose, something of the military man's taste for the ambush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just admired the hell out of a lot of the soldiers I met in
Vietnam,'' Just said. ``It was not for me. Hell, no. But the good
ones had a sense of loyalty, and the best ones had a real sense of
the limits of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Limits, and the terrible things that lie beyond them for people
and states, are central preoccupations of Just. Hence Vietnam;
hence Berlin. In both places, of course, the cold war's battles
were fought with great intensity. Their way of pushing people to
the outer edges of experience makes them natural settings for
Just's work.
</P>
<P>
   In the Vietnam War, the United States, with ``its industry, its
restlessness and sprawl, its impatience, its confidence, its anger
and its desire,'' went a step too far, driven in part by the egos
of men like Dicky Rostok, the antihero of ``A Dangerous Friend,''
whose faith in American power is almost limitless. Such faith is a
necessary basis for so farfetched an idea as building a nation in
the American image in a faraway place. But, Just suggests, it may
also be a form of blindness, and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Rostok, personal ambition and political passion mesh,''
Just said. ``But passion tends to go wrong so often.'' One of his
characters puts a similar thought about Rostok more bluntly in ``A
Dangerous Friend'': ``I have always believed that a mountainous ego
resulted from an absence of conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Just is deeply concerned with conscience. His ``atmosphere'' or
vision for ``A Dangerous Friend'' also emerged near the water, this
time on Martha's Vineyard, where he lives most of the year. He saw,
in his mind's eye, a man sitting on rickety pier, sketching and
resketching the same scene. This man, a survivor of Vietnam, had
withdrawn from the world, concluding that the only answer to chaos
was repetition.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear enough that the discipline of habit is also
attractive to Just, who is always at his battered typewriter for an
eight-hour day and always comfortably disheveled. Grief, he has
written, is the other face of grace; his graciousness is
unmistakable.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the old journalistic curiosity continues to drive him from a
settled life out into the world; and a darker side, a stormy
undertow, has persistently drawn him to Germany and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family came from Darmstadt to Chicago about 150 years ago,
and I've been interested by Germany for a very long time,'' Just
said. ``Interest grew to obsession through the paintings. There's
that great Max Beckmann portrait of the man in a tuxedo _ square
face, head down with a cigarette, just a majestic portrait, and
that led me to all the Expressionists, Kirchner, Schmidt-Rottluff,
Dix, and something provocative stayed in my mind forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Another image or atmosphere dear to Just, this one from a visit
to a German beach: a beautiful topless girl playing volleyball with
two boys, watched by old women dressed completely in black.
</P>
<P>
   For Just, so much was there: the perverse German state, broken
in two by Hitler's murderous madness, full still of bitter spies
and reproach, chronically divided, but alive still with the
vitality that, for Just, makes it ``the most talented nation in
Europe, even if it is the most burdened.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to Berlin as a visiting fellow at the recently opened
American Academy _ a ``gastarbeiter,'' or guest worker, as he puts
it, with his gentle, often self-mocking smile. For many years,
sojourns in Europe had meant sojourns in Paris with his wife, Sarah
Catchpole, but he felt it was time for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany is a feast of the mind, not the eye,'' he said. ``I
have not seen a single vista in Berlin that can compare favorably
to a commonplace sight in Paris. But the conversation, the quality
of introspection, the openness are fifty-fold what I found in
France.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that conversation, inevitably, has been about the
Holocaust, and some of it left Just breathless with its frankness
and pain. ``They are not forgetting,'' he said. ``It is with them
every minute of every hour of every days. My heart goes out to
those who bear no responsibility and think of what happened so
constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   He was at one Berlin dinner when a man started talking about his
father. A father much loved. A father later discovered to have been
a Nazi. Tears started to flow: a grown man talking about his father
and sobbing as he described how inexplicable it was that so good a
father could have embraced such evil.
</P>
<P>
   At another dinner, somebody remarked that Auschwitz would always
stand in the way of Germany's being a nation like any other. The
host said that was a ridiculous notion. Germany would be normal
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have asked: Why was it ridiculous to think that
Auschwitz would always prevent Germany from being normal?'' Just
said. ``I should have asked what normality meant to the host. But I
was silent.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems reasonable to assume that from that silence some of the
themes of Just's next novel will emerge. Germany has been in his
books for some time. ``As a nation,'' he once wrote, ``it resembled
Chicago, central to its region, a furious engine that advances on
its own inner logic, closed in on itself, with resentments enough
to fill the couches of Vienna _ yet beneath the surface there was
faith, patience and an implacable sense of destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   This European colossus will now move from backdrop to the front
of the stage. And what of Germany's being back at war, in Kosovo,
alongside the United States?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cold War is over, and Kosovo is not really about anything
larger than itself,'' Just said. ``I feel no point of comparison
with Vietnam, and no surprise or concern at Germany's role. We have
a responsibility now to the Albanians who lost their homes, and we
should take them back to their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Just said he would not be a direct witness of this European
struggle. ``There is no way I'd go back to war, no way I would get
a quotation straight today. Many of the things that make you a good
journalist have to be discarded to make you a good writer. Forget
the research. In a novel, every fact is a rock thrown in the hull,
and the boat sinks a bit.''

 &HT;    Comic pair turns tables on gurus of self-help
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're two of the hottest actors around _ Ben Stiller starred
in ``There's Something About Mary'' and Janeane Garofalo's resume
includes TV's late, lamented ``The Larry Sanders Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But now they're showing us something else: depth. With a
definite smirk. In ``Feel This Book'' (Ballantine, 224 pages,
$22.95), Stiller says, they attempted to write ``an
all-encompassing self-help book that touched on a lot of different
areas, but specialized in nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   They also attempted to describe their long-ago romantic
dalliance _ with predictably hilarious results. Following are
excerpts from an interview with the pair.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you offer that other self-help gurus can't?
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo: We offer the wisdom that comes from doing series
television, from having your name above the title of a film.
</P>
<P>
   Stiller: And also the experience of not ever having really had
one successful long-term relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Despite your short, ill-fated relationship, you're still
friends. What's your secret?
</P>
<P>
   Stiller: Just get together with somebody who feeds into all of
your neuroses and you feed into all their neuroses and
insecurities.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo: Right. You have to have somebody whose dysfunctions
dovetail perfectly with your own.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any truth to the talk that you made the relationship seem
like something more than it was?
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo: I have photos of me trying to seduce him in a
mechanical bear costume.
</P>
<P>
   Stiller: And I have the dirty sheets. No, we had a little thing,
a long time ago, and then, you know, all humor kind of springs from
a little nugget of truth. Hopefully, a tree of comedy grows.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Janeane, your ``Blame the Family'' chapter felt especially
impassioned. When's it time to finally let go?
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo: I don't think there is a good time to give up a
grudge. Especially with your family, because they're with you for
life. So I think it's an important show of internal strength and
inner fortitude to hang onto the grudge.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And Ben, you had some fun at other self-helpers' expense:
Tony Robbins, Deepak Chopra, etc. Anyone you purposely stayed away
from?
</P>
<P>
   Stiller: I think L. Ron Hubbard's grasp is further than we know.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you decide who got top cover billing?
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo: It was decided for us somehow. For some reason, it's
everyone's inclination to say ``Ben Stiller and Janeane Garofalo,''
instead of the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Ben?
</P>
<P>
   Stiller: I had lawyers working behind the scene so that I stayed
clean.

 &HT;    Father's Day comes once a year and Esquire makes the most out of
it
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Esquire ($3) puts together a thoughtful and entertaining
Father's Day issue packed with all kinds of Fathers, including the
priestly variety (in an improbable fashion spread) and more secular
Dads, such as Mike Tyson. Along with Tom Junod's portrait of the
fatherly Tyson (and his youngest son, Amir), is a heartbeaking tale
of Tommy Nothing Fancy, the Navajo boy doomed to live six short
years, and the adoptive father who teaches him to love fishing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SHE SAID, HE SAID: In Perspectives, Newsweek ($3.50) offers an
amusing pair of quotes. From GOP presidential hopeful Elizabeth
Dole, after her husband Bob said he might support rival John
McCain: ``I told him I loved him. I told him he was in the
woodshed.'' And from McCain, asked whether he'd spoken with Dole
since the flap: ``They haven't installed a phone in his woodshed
yet, so I haven't had a chance to speak with him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE OTHER SERBS? Basketball star Vlade Divac should be
sleeping, preparing for the fifth game of the playoffs against the
Utah Jazz, but at 3 in the morning he is up watching CNN and
dialing his homeland to find out which Serb relatives in Kosovo
have been killed by NATO bombs. According to Sports Illustrated
($2.95) columnist Rick Reilly, the Sacramento Kings center is no
fan of Slobodan Milosevic _ last summer he protested against the
Yugoslav leader in the streets of Belgrade _ but now is the target
of hate mail from those angry with Milosevic's genocidal policies.
Reilly presents the other side of the Kosovo story.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DEPRESSED TEENS: Along with the other newsmagazines, Time
($3.50) uses the shootings at Heritage High School in Conyers to
renew a discussion of youth violence, and to post a list of warning
signs that a young person may be headed wrong. Time also reports a
revival among evangelical teens, inspired by Cassie Bernall, the
Columbine High School student who was slain when she confessed, at
gunpoint, her belief in God.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE KINGDOM IS AT HAND: ``God called my father to the world's
big stadiums, and called me to its ditches,'' says Franklin Graham,
son of Billy Graham, one of the greatest preachers of modern times.
``I resented paying for my father's fame,'' Franklin once told a
reporter. ``All my life I suffered for it.'' In George ($2.95),
Elizabeth Kaye writes of the rising son, preparing to take over his
father's well-connected empire.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DYLAN GOES ELECTRIC: A big, fat, fun-to-borrow issue this
week, Entertainment Weekly ($3.95) boasts almost 100 pages devoted
to the 100 greatest moments in rock 'n' roll, from the Beatles'
appearance on ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' to the tragic departure of
Ginger from the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  EVERYONE'S A CRITIC: Who are those Internet mavens who divulge
plot lines, post secret movie scripts and fuel positive and
negative buzz? Yahoo! Internet Life ($3.99) introduces this
influential new breed of film geek, in particular Harry Knowles,
the outspoken (and well-padded) Austin, Texas, Web critic. Also in
this issue: a guide to the sites that made the new ``Star Wars:
Episode I _The Phantom Menace'' movie the Net's biggest event since
the Pathfinder landing on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SEX AND THE SINGLE GIRL: Since Bonnie Fuller departed
Cosmopolitan ($2.95) and arrived at Glamour ($2.99) the latter
woman's magazine has tended toward celebrity covers and such Helen
Gurley Brownish story ideas as ``How to make him worship the ground
you walk on'' and ``Get Moregasmic!'' This month's issue uses two
covers to gauge reader interest in more celebrity cover-girls:
copies with pop singer Shania Twain on the front will go to homes
in the South, Midwest and Canada; those with model Josie Maran will
go to both coasts.

BOOKS OF THE TIMES: EXECUTOR TIDIES UP ELLISON'S UNFINISHED
SYMPHONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(ms) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years, Ralph Ellison's unfinished second novel has
assumed the status of a literary myth. His first novel, ``Invisible
Man,'' published in 1952, established him unequivocally as a
modernist master, and over the next four decades he labored to
produce a follow-up to that masterpiece. In 1966 a fire at his home
destroyed a portion of his manuscript, and during the ensuing years
there were reports that the work in progress was slowly changing
shape, evolving into an increasingly ambitious saga that, in the
words of his literary executor, John F. Callahan, was
``multifarious, multifaceted, multifocused, multivoiced,
multitoned.''
</P>
<P>
   That manuscript was unfinished at Ellison's death in 1994, and
from some 2,000 pages of typescript and printouts, Callahan has
extracted ``Juneteenth,'' the one narrative he says that ``best
stands alone as a single, self-contained volume.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aiming, as Ellison had, at one complete volume,'' Callahan
writes, ``I proceeded to arrange his oft-revised, sometimes
reconceived scenes and episodes according to their most probable
development and progression. While doing so, I felt uneasily
Procrustean: Here and there limbs of the manuscript needed to be
stretched, and elsewhere a protruding foot might be lopped off, if
all the episodes were to be edited into a single, coherent,
continuous work.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting book provides the reader with intimations of the
grand vision animating Ellison's 40-year project, but it also feels
disappointingly provisional and incomplete. Given all the cutting
and tidying up Callahan has done, the book's opaqueness and
attenuation come as little surprise: after all, he has effectively
changed the book's entire structure and modus operandi. Instead of
the symphonic work Ellison envisioned, Callahan has given us a
single, tentatively rendered melodic line. Instead of a vast
modernist epic about the black experience in America, he has given
us a flawed linear novel, focused around one man's emotional and
political evolution.
</P>
<P>
   That central story _ featuring a ``hi-yaller'' boy named Bliss
who repudiates his black stepfather and grows up to become a
race-baiting Senator named Sunraider _ remains sketchy and
psychologically unconvincing. Callahan's narrative does not provide
a satisfying emotional basis for Bliss' startling transformation,
nor does it make persuasive his eventual efforts to come to terms
with his past. Still, there are bravura passages of writing in the
volume _ dazzling riffs that remake the American vernacular
tradition by juxtaposing old-time Bible-Belt sermons with
fire-breathing political rants, call-and-response exchanges with
Joycean stream-of-consciousness lines. Such brilliant passages
suggest that Ellison's uncompleted saga might have fused Faulkner's
mythic impulses with Twain's mastery of the American idiom, that
the unfinished work might have used the rich, interpenetrating
strands of American language to underscore the ways in which black
and white experience overlap and blur, the ways in which
individuals use language to both define and reinvent themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As for the tale of Bliss, it contains hints of Ellison's
conscious or unconscious determination to create a kind of bookend
to ``Invisible Man.'' That earlier novel recounted the story of a
nameless black man's search for an identity in a world intent on
defining him in terms of race, and in doing so, it unfolded into a
Dostoyevskian meditation on existential self-definition.
``Juneteenth,'' in contrast, focuses on a man's evasion of
identity, as he attempts _ in vain, it turns out _ to erase his
personal history by embracing racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   By cutting back and forth between the point of view of Bliss and
his surrogate father, the Rev. Alonzo Hickman, Ellison gives the
reader dozens of jigsaw puzzle pieces to fit together into a story.
We learn that Hickman has arrived in Washington (sometime in the
mid-1950s, it seems) to try to warn Senator Sunraider of impending
danger. When the senator is wounded by an assassin, the one person
he wants to see is the black minister _ the man, it turns out, who
raised him as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   As Hickman sits by the senator's hospital bed, the two men
review the past, sometimes talking to each other, sometimes
drifting into reveries and rationalizations of their own. Bit by
bit, it is revealed that Hickman adopted baby Bliss from a white
woman, whose accusations led to the lynching of Hickman's brother.
By turning the boy into his protege, Hickman hopes to redeem this
senseless death and transcend the racial hatred that his people
have endured.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ``promising babe'' wins the love and acceptance of
Hickman's Baptist congregation, something happens during a
Juneteenth celebration that derails Bliss' life. During the
service, commemorating the anniversary of June 19, 1865 (the day,
two and a half years after the effective date of the Emancipation
Proclamation, that Union troops landed in Galveston, Tex., and
informed the slaves that they were free), a crazed white woman
appears and declares that Bliss is her long-lost son.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman's congregation thwarts her efforts to kidnap Bliss, but
the boy henceforth longs for the mother he never knew. In time he
is reborn, not as Hickman's dreamed-of redeemer of racial prejudice
but as a con man and politician. In each of these new incarnations,
he will use the rhetorical skills he learned from Hickman for
selfish, secular ends.
</P>
<P>
   In some notes about his novel in progress, Ellison has Hickman
wondering why Bliss turned on the black people who brought him up:
``Was it perversity, or was it that the structure of power demanded
that anyone acting out the role would do so in essentially the same
way?'' Why did Bliss wrap his heart in ``stainless steel''? Why did
he embrace the politics of hate? Though such questions may be
addressed somewhere in the hundreds of manuscript pages Ellison
left behind, they are left dangling in these pages.
</P>
<P>
   In fact Bliss' inner life remains so shadowy in ``Juneteenth''
that he never becomes more than a symbol Ellison used to explore
the idea of racial prejudice _ a role that could have been
effective in a larger, multivoiced epic but that remains more
problematic in this more linear format. As it stands, Bliss'
actions often seem so arbitrary that he comes across as a
repudiation of the idea, so oft reiterated in Ellison's earlier
work, that experience, not ideology, forms the cornerstone of human
life, that identity always eludes the oversimplifications of race.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman, however, emerges as one of Ellison's most powerful
creations _ a big, large-hearted man whose idealism has been tested
by loss and whose capacity to love transcends his disillusionment.
A former jazzman turned preacher, Hickman is hard-wired to both the
spiritual yearnings of his congregation and their exuberant,
earthly desires. He articulates the dream of pluralism promised by
America's founders and his own Creator's faith in ``the basic unity
of human experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he despises the bigot that Bliss has become, Hickman
continues to love ``the boy whom the man had been.'' Indeed his
story suggests, as does the novel's epigraph from T.S. Eliot's
``Four Quartets,'' that memory can redeem the past, that it can
transfigure history, however painful, into another pattern.

DETERMINED TO PRESERVE HAITIAN ARTS IN MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When Dade County approved the renaming of several blocks
of Northeast Second Avenue, in the Little Haiti section of the
city, in honor of Felix Morisseau-Leroy, the revered Haitian poet
who died last fall, the planning of the ceremony in the
neighborhood fell to a man named Jan Mapou, who runs the parking
operations at Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   It's a more sensible choice than it may sound, for Mapou is
probably Miami's leading advocate for the Haitian arts.
</P>
<P>
   Parking chief is his day job. In the evenings he can be found on
Northeast Second at Libreri Mapou, the bookstore he owns. It serves
as headquarters for Sosyete Koukouy, an organization of Haitian
painters, dancers and actors whose purpose is to strengthen and
perpetuate Creole, the Haitian patois, in particular and Haitian
culture in general. The name means Society of Fireflies. ``We
lighten up the darkness,'' Mapou said.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the bookstore the other day, Mapou, 57, a man
whose genial manner doesn't entirely hide a sense of entitlement,
discussed invitations to the renaming ceremony with some society
members. They listed arts groups, Haitian business leaders and,
finally, members of local government, choosing two county
commissioners, the mayor and the Haitian consul.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forgot Clinton,'' someone said. And Mapou responded, ``We
have to stay away from the politicians completely.'' It was a joke,
but it was telling. Home to some 40,000 people, Little Haiti is a
tiny pocket of culture in this cacophonous multicultural region,
and a place where the local feeling is one of neglect, a perception
not generally disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Even a cursory drive-through shows that the neighborhood is a
poor one, not nearly festive enough to draw the tourism that many
of the denizens would like. The colorful Caribbean storefronts,
with pictographs of their wares painted on them; the streetside
vendors peddling mangoes and sugar cane; the botanicas, with their
voodoo elixirs and religious paintings _ they're all here, but
sprinkled amid ordinary urban squalor.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny but stubborn in the center of it sits Libreri Mapou. It
isn't the only focus for Haitian culture in the city (the
restaurant Tap-Tap, in South Beach, with its hand-painted tables
and impromptu musical performances, is better known), but in this
neighborhood it is an isolated phenomenon; the term cultural oasis
is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Mapou,'' said Lavarice Gaudin, who owns a shipping
company in Little Haiti and is an officer of Ve Ye Yo, an advocacy
group concerned, among other things, with the fate of Haitian
refugees. ``He is doing good things to keep Haitian culture alive.
We need more places for our culture here. His is all we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy St. Legere, the society's dance director, said the Mapou
bookstore was a haven for the Haitian artists in Miami. ``This is
where we gather,'' said Ms. St. Legere, who works as a school
speech pathologist but lives an hour and a half away, south of
Miami, near Homestead. ``But it's a little sad, because I don't
think enough people realize how important it is to our community.''
</P>
<P>
   The store sells books about Haiti and by Haitian authors in
English, French and Creole. ``I can tell you I sell more books in
Creole to non-Haitians than to Haitians,'' Mapou said. ``When I ask
why, they say, `I want to communicate with you, in your musical
language.' It's very easy, you know. Three thousand words, and
that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   The store is also home to readings by Caribbean authors
(upstairs, inscriptions by writers like Edwidge Danticat and Dany
Laferriere adorn the walls), scholarly lectures and small art
shows. In the courtyard out back, the Sosyete dancers rehearse; as
Mapou spoke, the troupe, under Ms. St. Legere's direction,
practiced rara and congo dances, accompanied by drummers, whose
syncopated rhythms resounded in the back of the store.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The society, an outgrowth of an advocacy group called Movement
Creole Haitian (though the pronunciation is French), was founded in
Haiti during the autocratic reign of Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier,
who insisted on French as the nation's official language even
though only a minority of Haitians spoke it.
</P>
<P>
   Creole had developed orally and had a scant written tradition,
and the Movement, of which Mapou was a founding member, was trying
to create written materials _ dictionaries and texts _ to
legitimize it. Sosyete Koukouy (pronounced SO-syuh-tay koo-KOO-yuh)
included Movement artists who performed in the Creole language and
drew on the traditions, in dance and song, of native folklore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government didn't like our group,'' Mapou said,
understating the case. He had been working as a banker, but he and
the rest of the group, he said, were accused of being Communists,
and eventually, in 1969, he and five other Movement members were
imprisoned. He spent four months and six days in the infamous Fort
Dimanche, hastening his expatriation.
</P>
<P>
   He left Haiti for New York City in 1971 and began spreading the
Creole gospel to the Haitian diaspora. ``In New York, there was
another problem,'' he said. ``The English language prevails. People
were not only neglecting the Creole language; they were neglecting
their culture.'' He spent more than a decade in New York; the
Sosyete chapter he established there remains.
</P>
<P>
   The Creole orthography was finally standardized in 1979; in
1987, a year after the Duvalier dynasty fell, Creole was
recognized, along with French, as an official language. A
literature began to explode. As president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide
``went to the U.N. and he spoke Creole; the pope went to Haiti and
he spoke in Creole,'' Mapou said. ``Now Creole is accepted, and we
are very proud we have played a role.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 Mapou began the Miami chapter of the Sosyete with
several other New Yorkers who had moved here. The headquarters were
initially elsewhere; but in 1990 Mapou opened his bookstore, next
door to its current location, little more than a stall, really, in
what remains the neighborhood's most distinguished building.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Caribbean Marketplace, it was designed by Charles
Harrison Pawley in emulation of Haitian gingerbread architecture,
with its wooden turrets and colorful facades, and with the idea of
bringing tourists to the neighborhood to shop for Haitian goods.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of Little Haiti's despair, the building is less
than a decade old but is already slipping into decrepitude. Its
owners went bankrupt two years ago, and it was taken over by the
city, which, lacking funds for a proper restoration, ceded it to
the county. The county's cultural affairs department has allotted
$15,000 for an engineering assessment, after which it hopes to form
a public and private partnership to transform the building into an
arts center.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, this is what Mapou wants: a place to expand, a place
for Haitian painters and sculptors to exhibit their work and a
place for his dancers and actors to rehearse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had an arts showroom next door, do you know how many
tourists would come here?'' he said. This is a subject that gets
his dander up. ``In another neighborhood, a building like that
would never be allowed to go down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime the Sosyete is operating on limited resources.
The county provides a small annual grant. Other than that, Mapou
squeaks by on bookstore earnings and donations generated by good
will.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he supported the group and the bookstore building, he
responded in Creole. ``Gres kochon kwit kochon,'' he said. Then he
translated: ``The fat from the pig cooks the pig.''

   Donald Rose, the head of the Intel Corp.'s global drive to
prevent Year 2000 computer problems from derailing microchip
production, is focused these days on 500 critical suppliers of
materials and basic services like power and phones.
</P>
<P>
   About half are ready for the date change, Rose says. Intel is
busy dispatching training, testing and auditing help to the others
in the hope they will catch up. But hope is a high-risk business
strategy, so Rose is turning more of his attention to backup plans.
</P>
<P>
   Intel already has begun installing extra power generators at
factories in Asian countries and Latin American countries with
shaky power grids. And its purchasers and technicians have been
visiting companies it does not buy from today to see if they could
step in if a supplier falters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes us up to six months to qualify a supplier of
something like specialty chemicals'' to meet Intel's quality
standards, Rose said. Driven by such deadlines for action, Intel's
preparations to overcome Year 2000 glitches are becoming as urgent
as its continuing efforts to prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has plenty of company. Once stuck on the ``do later'' part
of the Year 2000 agenda, contingency planning is suddenly in full
swing. After months of weighing options, businesses and governments
are being forced to decide just how much they will invest in
preparing for Year 2000 turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   As they do so, millions of workers who previously had little
exposure to Y2K, as the Year 2000 problem is known, are getting
their first good look at how seriously their employers are taking
it.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 contingency planning is not a subject executives and
their project leaders like discussing in any detail. Unlike most
repair work, contingency plans have to take into account not just
the computer user's own systems, but all the outside forces the
user cannot control, like public power, phones, water and the
readiness of both suppliers and major customers. The planners fear
offending partners, inviting lawsuits and, in some cases, alarming
customers or the public.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has told publicly traded
companies to describe their Year 2000 contingency planning in their
quarterly reports to it, but most are sticking to a few vague
sentences indicating they are working on it.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the plan in many cases is likely to be arranging
for more employees than normal to be on duty in the weeks before
and after New Year's, often to make sure a company can fall back on
nonelectronic methods of business such as taking shipping orders
over the phone. Vacations are being canceled and major computer
users like Paine Webber are booking hotel rooms for New Year's Eve
in back-office locations like Weehawken, N.J., to make sure
technicians are close to their data processing centers.
</P>
<P>
   It is also clear that growing confidence that major disruptions
are unlikely _ at least in the United States _ is putting pressure
on managers not to propose costly investments. Consultants like the
Gartner Group say the sums budgeted for contingencies will average
10 to 15 percent of the hundreds of billions of dollars projected
as the global tab for Year 2000 repairs and testing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the effort is opening a new window on how seriously the
world is taking the Year 2000 challenge. The Year 2000 problem
stems from decades of using two digits to represent the year in
dates, such as 9 for this year. Computers, software and electronic
devices may malfunction if they read 00 as 1900 or do not
understand that it is a date.
</P>
<P>
   Most Year 2000 contingency planning by big computer users is
aimed at coping with local disruptions similar to those society
often experiences from equipment failures, bad weather and
earthquakes. But big enterprises are also considering how to
respond to a global blitzkrieg of disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger of Y2K is a wide variety of things hitting
simultaneously,'' said Charles Snyder, head of the Year 2000
project at Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. in San Francisco. Levi has
scrutinized how it might shift or delay production of its jeans and
other products factory by factory. Snyder advocates ignoring the
nature of specific Year 2000 problems and simply looking at whether
the interruption at a factory would be a matter of hours, days or
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd go insane if you try to handle it without some kind of
streamlined game plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders hope contingency planning _ or business
continuity planning as many prefer to call it _ will reinforce the
prevailing cautious optimism that the Year 2000 challenge is being
met. ``It shouldn't signal a sense of alarm,'' said Dana Bennett,
who has overseen the Year 2000 project at Aetna, the insurance
giant based in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Golter, co-founder of the Northern Virginia Year 2000
Community Action Group, disagrees. ``It's just human nature that
planning for disruptions will make people who haven't been paying
attention more nervous,'' he said. But if nervousness raises
consciousness, he said, the public will benefit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the planning is going well beyond redeploying the army
of technicians that have done most of the repair work. Humana Inc.,
a major health insurer based in Louisville, Ky., is turning to
front-line employees like Zach Riser, who runs the mail room in its
Louisville service center, for such jobs as lining up backup
carriers for documents and overnight packages.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, many utilities drilled field employees who will be
stationed at power plants and distribution sites over the New
Year's holiday on how to use radio and other backup communication
systems to deliver vital data that normally flow electronically to
command centers.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Year 2000 contingency planning looks relatively
simple. Many large businesses and other major computer users can
start with plans they already have for computer crashes and natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many actions are minor adjustments. The state of
Washington's National Guard plans to mobilize 3,000 troops, about
half its ground forces, in December so they will be available to
help deal with loss of utilities, water or other essential
services, or to quell civil disorder. The plan is virtually cost
free, though, because the same troops would otherwise have been
reporting for routine training a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Lubbock, Texas, is buying materials for 1,200 stop
signs in one order this fall instead of spacing them out through
the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, 2000, and is suspending its
normal replacement program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have about 800 on hand in case traffic signals don't
work Jan. 1 instead of the usual 50 or so, but it won't add to my
budget for the year,'' said Geryl Hart Jr., manager of Lubbock's
traffic department.
</P>
<P>
   But experts in Year 2000 contingency planning say it gets
complicated because the possibilities are more varied than in
typical disruptions. Humana's standard 20-page disaster recovery
plan for its regional service centers swelled to 66 pages when
adapted for Year 2000 problems, mostly because it detailed steps to
restore services like the mail room deliveries that are normally
taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Training, staffing and equipment decision deadlines are also
looming for some. Automakers say they need to settle contingency
plans in the next month to take advantage of summer production
shutdowns for training. Union contracts require Kaiser Health Plans
to make up its mind _ and negotiate next month _ for extra hourly
employees it wants on duty for the New Year's holiday, according to
Deborah Reinhold, director of Kaiser's Year 2000 project. And
McKesson HBOC, a San Francisco-based drug distributor, said it had
to make its decision to order eight large backup diesel generators
from Caterpillar Inc. by May 5 to get guaranteed installation by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also need to worry about what happens if too many
others are thinking about the same backups they expect to use. Take
all the companies planning to rent generators. ``There's no way in
the world our industry could supply the demand that is in the
planning stages,'' said Mark Conrad, U.S. marketing director for
Aggrecko, the Dutch company that owns the world's largest rental
fleet of mobile generators.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubin, a leading information technology consultant, says
some of the toughest planning decisions may lie with key industries
like banking and telecommunications that could be flooded with
consumer inquiries Jan. 1 at the slightest sign _ or rumor _ of any
glitch. ``If those companies are understaffed and callers just get
busy signals, it will contribute to panic,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants say a few shortcomings show up repeatedly in plans
they see. Many companies, for example, are not ready to confirm and
evaluate disruptions quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a global company gets a call from Thailand from someone
saying the lights went out, how does it rapidly figure out if it's
a Y2K problem, how widespread it is, whether it will persist and
what others will do?'' Rubin asked.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Marcoccio, head of Gartner Group's Year 2000 research
program, says another common failing is assuming that contingency
plans are needed only for the first week of the new year. Gartner
estimates that less than 10 percent of computer software failures
will show up that quickly.

`JUNETEENTH': EXECUTOR TIDIES UP ELLISON'S UNFINISHED SYMPHONY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixing hed)  (Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(ms) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years, Ralph Ellison's unfinished second novel has
assumed the status of a literary myth. His first novel, ``Invisible
Man,'' published in 1952, established him unequivocally as a
modernist master, and over the next four decades he labored to
produce a follow-up to that masterpiece. In 1966 a fire at his home
destroyed a portion of his manuscript, and during the ensuing years
there were reports that the work in progress was slowly changing
shape, evolving into an increasingly ambitious saga that, in the
words of his literary executor, John F. Callahan, was
``multifarious, multifaceted, multifocused, multivoiced,
multitoned.''
</P>
<P>
   That manuscript was unfinished at Ellison's death in 1994, and
from some 2,000 pages of typescript and printouts, Callahan has
extracted ``Juneteenth,'' the one narrative he says that ``best
stands alone as a single, self-contained volume.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aiming, as Ellison had, at one complete volume,'' Callahan
writes, ``I proceeded to arrange his oft-revised, sometimes
reconceived scenes and episodes according to their most probable
development and progression. While doing so, I felt uneasily
Procrustean: Here and there limbs of the manuscript needed to be
stretched, and elsewhere a protruding foot might be lopped off, if
all the episodes were to be edited into a single, coherent,
continuous work.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting book provides the reader with intimations of the
grand vision animating Ellison's 40-year project, but it also feels
disappointingly provisional and incomplete. Given all the cutting
and tidying up Callahan has done, the book's opaqueness and
attenuation come as little surprise: after all, he has effectively
changed the book's entire structure and modus operandi. Instead of
the symphonic work Ellison envisioned, Callahan has given us a
single, tentatively rendered melodic line. Instead of a vast
modernist epic about the black experience in America, he has given
us a flawed linear novel, focused around one man's emotional and
political evolution.
</P>
<P>
   That central story _ featuring a ``hi-yaller'' boy named Bliss
who repudiates his black stepfather and grows up to become a
race-baiting Senator named Sunraider _ remains sketchy and
psychologically unconvincing. Callahan's narrative does not provide
a satisfying emotional basis for Bliss' startling transformation,
nor does it make persuasive his eventual efforts to come to terms
with his past. Still, there are bravura passages of writing in the
volume _ dazzling riffs that remake the American vernacular
tradition by juxtaposing old-time Bible-Belt sermons with
fire-breathing political rants, call-and-response exchanges with
Joycean stream-of-consciousness lines. Such brilliant passages
suggest that Ellison's uncompleted saga might have fused Faulkner's
mythic impulses with Twain's mastery of the American idiom, that
the unfinished work might have used the rich, interpenetrating
strands of American language to underscore the ways in which black
and white experience overlap and blur, the ways in which
individuals use language to both define and reinvent themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As for the tale of Bliss, it contains hints of Ellison's
conscious or unconscious determination to create a kind of bookend
to ``Invisible Man.'' That earlier novel recounted the story of a
nameless black man's search for an identity in a world intent on
defining him in terms of race, and in doing so, it unfolded into a
Dostoyevskian meditation on existential self-definition.
``Juneteenth,'' in contrast, focuses on a man's evasion of
identity, as he attempts _ in vain, it turns out _ to erase his
personal history by embracing racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   By cutting back and forth between the point of view of Bliss and
his surrogate father, the Rev. Alonzo Hickman, Ellison gives the
reader dozens of jigsaw puzzle pieces to fit together into a story.
We learn that Hickman has arrived in Washington (sometime in the
mid-1950s, it seems) to try to warn Senator Sunraider of impending
danger. When the senator is wounded by an assassin, the one person
he wants to see is the black minister _ the man, it turns out, who
raised him as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   As Hickman sits by the senator's hospital bed, the two men
review the past, sometimes talking to each other, sometimes
drifting into reveries and rationalizations of their own. Bit by
bit, it is revealed that Hickman adopted baby Bliss from a white
woman, whose accusations led to the lynching of Hickman's brother.
By turning the boy into his protege, Hickman hopes to redeem this
senseless death and transcend the racial hatred that his people
have endured.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ``promising babe'' wins the love and acceptance of
Hickman's Baptist congregation, something happens during a
Juneteenth celebration that derails Bliss' life. During the
service, commemorating the anniversary of June 19, 1865 (the day,
two and a half years after the effective date of the Emancipation
Proclamation, that Union troops landed in Galveston, Tex., and
informed the slaves that they were free), a crazed white woman
appears and declares that Bliss is her long-lost son.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman's congregation thwarts her efforts to kidnap Bliss, but
the boy henceforth longs for the mother he never knew. In time he
is reborn, not as Hickman's dreamed-of redeemer of racial prejudice
but as a con man and politician. In each of these new incarnations,
he will use the rhetorical skills he learned from Hickman for
selfish, secular ends.
</P>
<P>
   In some notes about his novel in progress, Ellison has Hickman
wondering why Bliss turned on the black people who brought him up:
``Was it perversity, or was it that the structure of power demanded
that anyone acting out the role would do so in essentially the same
way?'' Why did Bliss wrap his heart in ``stainless steel''? Why did
he embrace the politics of hate? Though such questions may be
addressed somewhere in the hundreds of manuscript pages Ellison
left behind, they are left dangling in these pages.
</P>
<P>
   In fact Bliss' inner life remains so shadowy in ``Juneteenth''
that he never becomes more than a symbol Ellison used to explore
the idea of racial prejudice _ a role that could have been
effective in a larger, multivoiced epic but that remains more
problematic in this more linear format. As it stands, Bliss'
actions often seem so arbitrary that he comes across as a
repudiation of the idea, so oft reiterated in Ellison's earlier
work, that experience, not ideology, forms the cornerstone of human
life, that identity always eludes the oversimplifications of race.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman, however, emerges as one of Ellison's most powerful
creations _ a big, large-hearted man whose idealism has been tested
by loss and whose capacity to love transcends his disillusionment.
A former jazzman turned preacher, Hickman is hard-wired to both the
spiritual yearnings of his congregation and their exuberant,
earthly desires. He articulates the dream of pluralism promised by
America's founders and his own Creator's faith in ``the basic unity
of human experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he despises the bigot that Bliss has become, Hickman
continues to love ``the boy whom the man had been.'' Indeed his
story suggests, as does the novel's epigraph from T.S. Eliot's
``Four Quartets,'' that memory can redeem the past, that it can
transfigure history, however painful, into another pattern.

   NEW DELHI, India _ On Friday, the eighth anniversary of former
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, his widow, Sonia,
canceled all her speeches, donned a white sari bordered in black
and made a sorrowful visit to the memorial where he was cremated.
</P>
<P>
   Her very public withdrawal into private grief deepened the gloom
of her bereaved political supporters. For days they had gone on
hunger strikes, burned her critics in effigy and even tried to
immolate themselves, all to convince ``Madam'' to come back as
president of the country's most venerable political party.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Mrs. Gandhi gave them what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   This enigmatic woman, who was raised a Catholic in a small town
in Italy and who rose to power through marriage into India's
founding dynasty, sent word to Congress Party officials that she
will lead them once again.
</P>
<P>
   Surely one of the most improbable of political leaders, Mrs.
Gandhi, 52, had abruptly resigned a week ago, saying she was deeply
wounded that three party leaders had revolted against her candidacy
for prime minister because of her foreign birth and political
inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   An emergency meeting of party members from all over the country,
which had been called for Tuesday in a last-ditch attempt to woo
her back, is now likely to turn into a coronation of the regal,
charismatic Mrs. Gandhi as the party's unquestioned leader and its
candidate for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable events of the past week have upended the politics
of India, the world's biggest democracy, just months before
national elections are to be held.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party, whose aging leaders have openly admitted
that they are abjectly dependent on Mrs. Gandhi to win elections,
has been saved from disintegration by her return.
</P>
<P>
   But last week the party, which had been poised to make electoral
gains against the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, split
over the emotionally charged issue of Mrs. Gandhi's Italian
origins. The three party leaders who rebelled against her were
expelled on Thursday. They have vowed to start a rival political
force that could bring together a formidable alliance of regional
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a nation struggling to lift hundreds of millions of its
citizens from dire poverty, to make peace with neighboring Pakistan
and to manage its status as a new nuclear power, the dominant issue
of the September election is likely to be whether an Indian citizen
born and raised elsewhere should be allowed to serve as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   It is a question that goes to the heart of the nation's idea of
itself. Does a person have to be born on Indian soil to be a true
patriot? Or can someone who believes in India's pluralistic
democratic ideals and who chooses to become an Indian become a
citizen equal to any other?
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the captivating melodrama is Mrs. Gandhi
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi, who survived her family's tragic, blood-soaked saga
with queenly reserve, has given only one interview in her life, and
that was 14 years ago to a Hindi-language weekly. Clues to her
character must come instead from her close friends and colleagues,
and a review of memoirs and histories about this most public of
families.
</P>
<P>
   What emerges is a portrait of a passionate, headstrong woman who
is capable of making startling, independent choices but who has
nevertheless been swept into the tumultuous, no-holds-barred
political life of India by forces larger than herself.
</P>
<P>
   The most fateful of her choices was that of a mate.
</P>
<P>
   The romance began in 1965: Fetching Italian teen-ager with long
chestnut hair chances to meet dark-eyed scion of Indian political
dynasty in homey Greek restaurant and falls in love.
</P>
<P>
   Rajiv Gandhi was then studying at Cambridge University. Sonia
Maino was an 18-year-old student at an English-language school in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   She had been raised in a conservative home near Turin and had
only ``a vague idea that India existed somewhere in the world, with
its snakes, elephants and jungles,'' she has written.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She knew nothing of Rajiv's family and the central role it had
played in the monumental struggle to wrest India's independence
from the British empire.
</P>
<P>
   Rajiv's grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, a patrician lawyer, spent
years in prison during the freedom movement and served as India's
first Prime Minister. Rajiv's mother, Indira Gandhi, a petite woman
with a ruthless instinct for power, become Prime Minister herself
in 1966 and dominated Indian political life for almost two decades.
(The family is not related to Mohandas K. Gandhi, the Mahatma, the
most prominent opponent of British rule.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, shortly after Sonia turned 21, her father reluctantly
allowed her to move to India to wed Rajiv, an airline pilot.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Indian way, friends say, Sonia also married her
husband's family. She and Rajiv lived with his mother and her other
son, Sanjay, and his family. Sonia became the ideal bahu, an
obedient, devoted daughter-in-law. She attended to the comforts of
her mother-in-law, selecting elegant silken saris for her and
cooking her favorite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, after Indira Gandhi was thrown out of office by the
voters and thrown into jail by Parliament on charges of abusing her
official powers, it was Sonia who carried home-cooked meals to her
every morning and evening.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout these years, Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi led a
determinedly private life, content to leave politics to the brash,
imperious Sanjay, whom Indira Gandhi was grooming to be her
successor.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1980 Indira Gandhi, in an extraordinary political
comeback, once again became prime minister. Months later, Sanjay
died in a plane crash and Rajiv became the heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Gandhi has written that she fought ``like a tigress'' to
keep her husband out of politics. In a memoir published by Penguin
Books India the year after he was assassinated, she says she
remembers feeling ``every minute drawing us closer to the abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   But her husband accepted his obligation to his mother and became
a member of Parliament. His wife continued to look after the home
and took a course in the restoration of oil paintings. In 1983, 15
years after moving to India and 10 years after she became eligible
for citizenship, she became an Indian. She was 36.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the fates again intervened.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Oct. 31, 1984, while Sonia Gandhi was bathing,
she heard a sound like firecrackers popping in the garden, followed
by screams. She rushed outside to discover that her mother-in-law,
the prime minister, had been shot by her own security guards. Sonia
Gandhi took Indira Gandhi's bullet-riddled body to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later Rajiv arrived and he and his wife sequestered
themselves. When P.C. Alexander, the prime minister's principal
secretary, burst in on them, a weeping Sonia was begging her
husband not to become prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi was sworn in that same day. He and his wife immediately
withdrew their two children, Rahul and Priyanka, from school
because of fears they would be vulnerable to attack. For the next
five years the children, studying with private tutors at home, were
``virtually imprisoned,'' their mother wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband won a landslide electoral victory later that year on
a wave of sympathy. The Nehru-Gandhi family, with its almost mythic
status, still exerted a hold on the people's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   But Gandhi's term was blighted by never-proven charges of
corruption, and he lost his bid for re-election in 1989. In 1991,
as he campaigned again, a suicidal terrorist detonated a bomb that
was strapped to her waist, ripping his body apart.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb also shattered the Congress Party. For years Indira
Gandhi had squelched dissent and undermined potential rivals.
Immediately after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the family
loyalists turned to the grief-stricken Sonia to take over, but she
flatly refused.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Rajiv wasn't even cremated and those Congress oldies asked her
to be Congress president,'' said Mrs. Gandhi's longtime friend
Rupika Chawla, an art conservator. ``They were as vulgar as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi withdrew from political life to head the Rajiv
Gandhi Foundation in New Delhi and dedicate herself to promoting
girls' education and employment for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a stream of party leaders courted her. She listened, but
said little. Some called her the Sphinx.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   By late 1997 the faction-ridden party, led by an octogenarian,
seemed to be in its death throes. And so, after years of resisting
the tidal pull into politics, Mrs. Gandhi agreed to campaign for
Congress in the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chawla said she believes her friend became more
self-reliant after her husband's death. She was not pushed into
heading the Congress Party. She chose it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a legacy,'' Mrs. Chawla said. ``And there was no one
left, really.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi began the campaign in Sriperumbudur, where her
husband was assassinated, and barnstormed across the nation. She
presented herself as a traditional Indian widow dedicated to her
husband's memory and only in politics to save the family legacy and
to battle the Bharatiya Janata Party, which she believed was out to
destroy the nation's secular heritage by setting Hindu against
Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by her two children, she struck a deep emotional chord
with adoring crowds who flocked to hear her wooden reading of
speeches in Italian-accented Hindi.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, she agreed to be president of the party and set
out to rebuild its support among Muslims and the poor. She elevated
younger leaders, persuaded Congress to require that a third of its
officials be women and became its purposeful, public face.
</P>
<P>
   In November Congress roared to victories against the Hindu
nationalists in state elections.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the calamitous bid last month to topple the Hindu
nationalist-led coalition and form a new government headed by Mrs.
Gandhi. Congress succeeded, barely, in bringing down the
government, which lost a confidence vote by a single vote, but
failed miserably to create a new majority.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened critics began to say Mrs. Gandhi was a power-hungry,
incompetent politician, not the self-sacrificing widow her handlers
would have the public believe. Her credibility as a winner was
heavily damaged by her erroneous boast that she had the votes to
form a new government.
</P>
<P>
   Elections were called for September and October.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, thousands of people continued to flock to
Mrs. Gandhi's home to wait for hours in 105-degree heat for the
chance of a word with her. Twice a week, they passed through
intensive security checks to enter the grounds and array themselves
behind a metal fence built around a lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi recently spent almost two hours in the sweltering
heat, earnestly working her way around the fence. As usual, she was
impeccably dressed in an understated sari. Her dark hair was in its
trademark, shoulder-length flip.
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon wore on, large sweat stains appeared under her
arms, but she did not quit until she had reached every last person.
To most, she just pressed her hands together in the prayerful Hindu
greeting. But many handed her crumpled pieces of paper with
scribbled requests for jobs, or medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But her prominence has brought strong criticism as well as
feudal adulation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She has not yet responded herself to questions about whether she
retained both her Indian and Italian citizenship, as Italy allows
and India forbids. Instead, surrogates say that such questions are
an insult and that of course she renounced her Italian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   As proof of her Indianness, her friends and colleagues cite her
role as the traditional Indian daughter-in-law and widow, as well
as her superb taste in handloomed saris, her ease in eating with
her fingers and her use of cardamom and cloves to freshen her
breath.
</P>
<P>
   But their insistence betrays a fear that the issue of her
Italian birth may resonate. A recent poll for Outlook magazine
found that almost half those surveyed said her foreign origin
should disqualify her from being Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, when hundreds of Congress members from all over the
nation gather in New Delhi, Mrs. Gandhi is expected to give an
emotional speech that stakes her claim to be a committed Indian who
has already sacrificed her beloved husband for the greater good of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose India as my country,'' she declared in her letter of
resignation. ``I am Indian and shall remain so till my last
breath.''

 &HT;    GORE BACKS SUBSIDES FOR RELIGIOUS GROUPS DOING SOCIAL WORK
 &HT;    550&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vice President Al Gore proposed Monday that the
government subsidize religious organizations so that ``the unique
power of faith'' can combat social ills.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking at an adult rehabilitation center run by the
Salvation Army, embraced an idea first offered by Republicans as he
called for ``a new partnership'' between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith- and value-based organizations'' have already shown ``a
muscular commitment'' to facing the nation's social problems, Gore
said, and a partnership with government would allow them to have an
even greater impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen the difference faith-based organizations make,''
Gore said, citing the experiences of his wife, Tipper, in working
with the homeless at Christ Church in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the lesson to the nation is clear: in those
instances where the unique power of faith can help us meet the
crushing social challenges that are otherwise impossible to meet,
... we should explore carefully tailored partnerships with our
faith community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was introduced by Bradford Culpepper, a resident of the
rehabilitation center who marveled that he had the opportunity to
stand on the same platform with the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also shared the podium with Atlanta firefighter Matt
Mosely, whose daring rescue of a man trapped on a burning crane
mesmerized viewers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposed expanding the so-called ``Charitable Choice''
provision of the 1996 welfare reform law that allows states to
enlist ``faith-based'' organizations to provide basic services to
help move people from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must dare to embrace faith-based approaches that advance
our shared goals as Americans,'' he said. To do so would usher in
``a new era of civil society collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a former divinity student at Vanderbilt University, said
that approach should also be used for other social services, such
as drug treatment, homelessness and the prevention of youth
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that some civil liberties experts object that such
support could breach the constitutional wall between church and
state, Gore said there should be ``clear and strict safeguards''
against the government promoting a particular religious view.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president made a veiled reference to former President
Bush's emphasis on volunteerism, rather than expanded government
programs, in addressing social ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some past national political leaders have asked us to rely on
a fragile patchwork of well-intentioned volunteerism to fee the
hungry and house the homeless,'' he said. ``That approach,
optimistic though it was, was not adequate for the problems too
many Americans face. It left too many American children behind to
suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, the vice president traveled to Conyers, where
he met privately for more than 45 minutes at Rockdale Baptist
Church with the families of students who were wounded in last
week's shootings at Heritage High School. Security was tight at the
meeting, and media were kept at a distance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore then returned to Atlanta for a reception and private dinner
that were expected to net some $350,000 for his campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal to provide government subsidies to religious
charities is remarkably similar to welfare reform provisions
sponsored in 1996 by Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., and to initiatives
currently pushed in Texas by Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner
for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   His embrace of the ideas was ridiculed by the national chairman
of the Republican Party, Jim Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a welcome change of heart for someone who gave just $353
to charity in 1997, and whose best-known participation in a
not-for-profit religious organization was to hold a campaign
fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   The address, which his campaign promoted as a major statement on
values, came as the vice president began a three-day campaign swing
through the South.
</P>
<P>
   Gore struck similar themes earlier in the day in Orlando at a
luncheon that netted his presidential campaign an estimated
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment industry should show ``more restraint'' in the
production of violent and sexually explicit entertainment, he said
from the stage of the Hard Rock Cafe next to the Universal Studios
theme park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Images affect behavior,'' he insisted, or there would be no
advertising industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``number one solution'' to the problems facing children
today is that ``parents need to do a better job,'' Gore added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was flying late Monday night to Texas, where he plans two
more days of events.
</P>
<P>
   According to a news release provided by his press office, Gore
planned Tuesday to announce a regulation reassuring families that
enrolling for government benefits would not affect their
immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new regulation will improve the health of our families by
addressing widespread confusion that prevents legal immigrants from
signing up for health insurance, school lunch, child care and other
essential programs,'' Gore said.

<P>
   Recognizing that some civil liberties experts object that such
support could breach the constitutional wall between church and
state, Gore said there should be ``clear and strict safeguards''
against the government promoting a particular religious view.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president made a veiled reference to former President
Bush's emphasis on volunteerism, rather than expanded government
programs, in addressing social ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some past national political leaders have asked us to rely on
a fragile patchwork of well-intentioned volunteerism to fee the
hungry and house the homeless,'' he said. ``That approach,
optimistic though it was, was not adequate for the problems too
many Americans face. It left too many American children behind to
suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, the vice president traveled to Conyers, where
he met privately for more than 45 minutes at Rockdale Baptist
Church with the families of students who were wounded in last
week's shootings at Heritage High School. Security was tight at the
meeting, and media were kept at a distance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore then returned to Atlanta for a reception and private dinner
that were expected to net some $350,000 for his campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal to provide government subsidies to religious
charities is remarkably similar to welfare reform provisions
sponsored in 1996 by Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., and to initiatives
currently pushed in Texas by Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner
for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   His embrace of the ideas was ridiculed by the national chairman
of the Republican Party, Jim Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a welcome change of heart for someone who gave just $353
to charity in 1997, and whose best-known participation in a
not-for-profit religious organization was to hold a campaign
fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   The address, which his campaign promoted as a major statement on
values, came as the vice president began a three-day campaign swing
through the South.
</P>
<P>
   Gore struck similar themes earlier in the day in Orlando at a
luncheon that netted his presidential campaign an estimated
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment industry should show ``more restraint'' in the
production of violent and sexually explicit entertainment, he said
from the stage of the Hard Rock Cafe next to the Universal Studios
theme park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Images affect behavior,'' he insisted, or there would be no
advertising industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``number one solution'' to the problems facing children
today is that ``parents need to do a better job,'' Gore added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was flying late Monday night to Texas, where he plans two
more days of events.
</P>
<P>
   According to a news release provided by his press office, Gore
planned Tuesday to announce a regulation reassuring families that
enrolling for government benefits would not affect their
immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new regulation will improve the health of our families by
addressing widespread confusion that prevents legal immigrants from
signing up for health insurance, school lunch, child care and other
essential programs,'' Gore said.

<P>
   The arguments have become familiar and, despite their poignancy,
so have the images. More than two months into the NATO bombing
operation, people who said at the beginning that they were
following every move now see the war over Kosovo as a story with a
recognizable cast of characters and few plot surprises. The only
mystery _ how it will all end _ does not seem imminent enough to
sustain attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been watching TV _ I've been working, painting and
quilting,'' said David Gammons, a White Plains, N.Y., artist who
intently followed the first weeks of war against the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still going on, I know, but just shoot the man and be
done with it,'' he added. `'It's enough already. It's news that
went on and went on and what else is new?''
</P>
<P>
   While NATO members debate more intensely than ever whether, when
and how to send in ground troops, the slow dance of diplomacy and
consensus-building cannot compete with more personal concerns for
the attention of many of a group of people in White Plains who have
been asked their views periodically since the bombing began two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel at this point I have given up, because I feel it's not
going anywhere and nothing is determined,'' said Dilia Theodosakia,
a retired secretary who had once been deeply troubled by her
conflicting feelings about the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, that began to
kind of shake things up and I was wondering whether something would
happen, something would get resolved,'' she said. ``But then that
kind of straightened out again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gammons and Mrs. Theodosakia have not changed their views on the
war: He is convinced the United States should fight to protect
Kosovo Albanians and she believes the bombing only hurts both Serbs
and the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   None of those interviewed _ retirees, merchants, government
workers _ have change their initial views, but almost everyone in
this small sampling of public opinion expressed fatigue with a
conflict that has lasted longer than any of them imagined it would.
Still, those who supported the war said they do not believe the
United States and its NATO allies can walk away from it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to be in a war,'' said Kurt Olson, the owner of a
film processing shop, Photo-Finish, in downtown White Plains.
``Clinton doesn't want it. They are doing it because they feel they
have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said he no longer devotes the attention to Kosovo news
that he did when the bombing campaign started and that he was
trying to educate himself on the players and issues. ``I guess I've
been moving on to other things, like the school shootings, and
lately Kosovo really has not been a big part of the news at all,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the war has receded to background noise in his life,
however, Olson keeps up with the debate within NATO on how to
proceed. The main point for him, from the beginning, has been that
the attack on Yugoslavia is an act by the alliance, and not only by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is worried now that NATO members appear divided over
the issue of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said he is not overly troubled to hear smaller NATO
countries object to ground troops, because they know the United
States and Britain would probably supply most of the troops anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``If you don't have a unified NATO force there,
without Germany and the others _ without at least a majority of the
big countries represented _ then it can't be called a NATO
action.''
</P>
<P>
   But, unless it wins its point, he does not see how the alliance
can stop its attacks on the Yugoslavs without damaging itself and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, there has to be a decision on how to end the
whole conflict,'' he said. ``But the worst thing would be to stop
now. If a few countries say they can't send ground troops, and then
we stopped, that would be worse than just few countries saying
we've got to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gammons, the White Plains artist, said that events in his own
neighborhood have made him impatient with the idea of Americans
getting involved in other peoples' conflicts. He said he still
supports the aims of the war because he believes atrocities are
being committed against the Kosovo Albanians. But he said he does
not want problems from far away to affect his own life.
</P>
<P>
   He and some neighbors are up in arms about a recent influx of
immigrants who have moved into rented rooms in single-family homes
in their Battle Hill area of White Plains. ``That's having a direct
impact on me, much more than Kosovo,'' he said. ``I am about to
become an activist in my own community, so I can't even think about
that. It's not in my own back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   He has started to view at least one piece of the war in
Yugoslavia _ the decision to resettle 20,000 Kosovo refugees in the
United States _ through the prism of his own immediate concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want them to be brought to White Plains,'' Gammons
said of the refugees. ``I know that sounds awful and I do feel
terrible for them. But if there's a moral obligation, it's the
moral obligation I have to myself, my neighbors and those who have
invested a lot here.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha McCauley, a White Plains retiree, disagrees. Unlike most
of the others interviewed, she still avidly reads about Kosovo in
the newspapers, as she has since the first days of the bombing, and
she tenaciously defends her full support for the war as a moral
duty. Accepting Kosovo refugees, she said, is also an obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, we are a superpower and we are all different
nationalities anyway,'' said Mrs. McCauley, who is the
granddaughter of Irish immigrants. ``I think it's wonderful we're
finding places for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else has been accomplished, she added, the war has
revealed to her the character of Milosevic and the plight of
Albanians expelled from their homes in Kosovo. ``It's good he's
been exposed,'' she said. ``It took a long time to get him exposed,
and now he couldn't keep doing it without the whole world knowing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Theodosakia has tried to put herself in the place of the
Serbian people and, as an Orthodox Christian, she has found herself
in great sympathy with them as victims of NATO bombs. But she said
she still feels battered by the conflicting and confusing
impressions of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching television with my husband and we saw
Milosevic,'' she said. ``He sounded so convincing. Then after what
you see on our news, you get very confused because you hear what a
monster this man is.''
</P>
<P>
   Her earlier anger with both sides and especially with President
Clinton, whom she distrusts, has given way to resignation that the
war will inevitably expand. ``You see people scattered all over the
place, losing their families and their homes,'' Mrs. Theodosakia
said. ``And at the same time, this ethnic cleansing has been
escalated by the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I feel there's nothing we can do about it,'' she
added. ``Demonstrations did nothing. The president has his own way
of getting what he wants.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably cool air will cover the interior Northeast and
Great Lakes states Tuesday as a powerful storm cuts off from
upper-level steering winds over southern Ontario. The front marking
the leading edge of the cooler air will pass through Maine during
the morning, accompanied by heavy rain and thunderstorms.
Meanwhile, a chill rain will fall on the low's western flank in
upper Michigan and northern Wisconsin as a conveyor of moisture
remains over the area.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, several spokes of upper level energy rotating
around the storm will ignite scattered showers punctuated by peals
of thunder from the southern Great Lakes to the northern
Appalachians. Some of the showers will be accompanied by small hail
and gusty winds.
</P>
<P>
   Ample sunshine will occur from southern New Jersey to Florida.
It will be breezy and noticeably less humid in much of the Piedmont
as the moist air mass of Monday has been replaced by much drier
Canadian air.
</P>
<P>
   Slow-moving showers and thundershowers will form in parts of
Texas, Oklahoma and the southern Rockies as moist air is forced to
ascend the sloping terrain. Localized flooding is possible,
especially along mountain streams in southern Colorado and northern
Mew Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, bright sunshine will grace areas from central
California to the northern Plains as high pressure from the surface
to 18,000 feet drifts slowly eastward. Readings will be quite mild,
with the exception of the immediate Northwest coast where onshore
breezes and low clouds will keep temperatures in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Hot and Cold
</P>
<P>
   The mercury topped out Sunday at 91 degrees in Portland, Ore.,
tying the record high for the date. In fact, much of the Pacific
Northwest and Northern California have experienced great warmth
lately. A northward retreat of the jet stream has prompted offshore
breezes across the region, limiting the cooling effect of the
Pacific Ocean. Often, when the Northwest gets very warm, portions
of the Northeast turn cool. True to form, a return to chillier
weather will arrive across the Northeast early this week behind a
strong cold front that moved off the Atlantic seaboard Monday.

 DESPITE NATO EFFORTS, MILOSEVIC KEEPS HIS FLOW OF OIL AND
CASH (Exclusive)  
(ART ADV: Map is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As part of the campaign against President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia, the Clinton administration and NATO have
tried to cut off his oil supply and his bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It is a campaign that has not gone well, American and NATO
officials say. Barges are filled with oil in Ukrainian ports and
cross the Black Sea to chug up the Danube River through Bulgaria
and Romania. To pay for it, Milosevic is using money he secreted in
banks in Cyprus during the earlier period of sanctions against
Yugoslavia, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and European governments have appealed to
Ukraine to shut down the trade and they have asked Cyprus to freeze
Milosevic's bank accounts, American and NATO officials say, but to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit to Washington last week, Gen. Wesley Clark,
NATO's commander, raised alarms about the oil shipments traveling
up the Danube and said that action needed to be taken to stop them.
He said this route was increasingly being used because NATO had
been somewhat successful in choking off the supply coming into
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say that they do not have a good fix on the
volume of oil Milosevic is getting through this route _ he is still
getting some from ships unloading at Montenegrin ports _ but they
say that it is Russian oil. The deals are being arranged by
middlemen who are making a tremendous profit because of the risks
involved, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much oil Milosevic was getting, one administration
official said, ``All he needs.'' Another official said that was an
exaggeration, but he conceded that the Serbian leader was getting
enough oil to keep his military machine going. A third official
replied, simply, ``Too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and NATO have tried to deal with the
matter quietly, fearing that making it a public issue could
backfire.
</P>
<P>
   When an oil embargo was last in effect against Yugoslavia, from
1992 until the signing of the Dayton peace accords in 1995,
Bulgaria and Romania were major conduits for oil in violation of
the sanctions. (Greek and Italian oil companies were major
suppliers, with most of their oil moving through Albania, a route
that has now been largely shut down.)
</P>
<P>
   But Washington and European capitals expect to have more success
now. The governments in Bulgaria and Romania have become more
stable and have better-trained law enforcement agencies; above all,
they have moved from their Communist pasts, expressing a strong
desire to get into NATO and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bulgaria and Romania have not been as cooperative as the
administration would like.
</P>
<P>
   The governments argue that they cannot interfere with traffic on
the Danube because it is an international waterway covered by the
Danube Convention of 1948, which calls for free movement of ships.
But American officials dismiss those assertions, noting that the
convention was signed by the Danube riparian states when they were
part of the Soviet Union; West Germany was the one Danube state
that did not sign.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, American and NATO officials say, the major problem is
Ukraine, which is the source of the oil transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week during meetings in Brussels, Belgium, Boris Tarasyuk,
Ukraine's foreign minister, was cordially but firmly told that his
country must stop the barges from loading up with oil in the
Ukrainian ports, a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   Tarasyuk countered with complaints about the economic damage
Ukraine was suffering because of the war against Yugoslavia. He
said that it had cost his country $220 million in lost trade, that
Ukrainian ports alone had lost $12 million, and that a Danube
shipping company in Ukraine was losing $313,000 a day. Who was
going to compensate Ukraine for that, he demanded of the NATO
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and NATO are not confident that they
will prevail upon the Ukrainian government. Nearly 90 percent of
the Ukrainian population is against the NATO bombing, according to
recent polls there, an American official said. It is for this same
reason that the administration does not feel that it can make a
public issue out of Ukraine's lack of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   In Cyprus, too, the Clinton administration is worried about
upsetting the government and so has not said anything publicly, but
it is not happy that the Cypriots have refused to close the bank
accounts belonging to Milosevic and to the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
   With its secretive banking laws, Cyprus has become a major
money-laundering center, especially for Russian organized criminal
operations, American and European law-enforcement officials say.
European law enforcement officials say that many of the continent's
cigarette-smuggling operations use Cyprus, including an operation
in which one of Milosevic's sons is involved.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they do not know how much Milosevic has
in these accounts, in part because finding his assets had never
been a priority of the CIA, several officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But however much is in them, the Cypriots argue that there is no
basis for seizing the bank accounts because there are no United
Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia. Most of the sanctions against
Yugoslavia that were imposed in 1992 were lifted after the Dayton
peace accords in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But back when the sanctions were in effect, Cyprus did not
cooperate either.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always found loopholes,'' an American official said.

 &HT;    Venture capitalists 'angels' in disguise?
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Venture capitalists and ``angel'' investors get a lot
of attention for funding private company deals. But a report on
small business financing shows they aren't as generous as popularly
believed.
</P>
<P>
   They provide just over seven percent of the financing for
private U.S. companies with 20 or more employees, a former
economist with the Securities and Exchange Commission concludes.
Susan Woodward, now chief economist with the San Francisco
investment bank OffRoad Capital Corp., based her findings on two
government reports: The Federal Reserve Bank's National Survey of
Small Business Finance and its Call Report data. The Call report
contains mandatory monthly filings from banks regarding their
assets. The Fed's survey is based on 1993 data but Woodward also
used the change in bank loans to businesses between 1993 and 1998
to estimate the change in all small business financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' Woodward said. ``Venture capital gets a
huge amount of attention in the press. It's so sexy and exciting.
Their offices are so opulent. They're so well paid. And the buzz is
that they earn spectacular returns.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, venture capitalists provided half of what private
individual investors or angels gave. Part of the reason venture
capitalists get so much attention, Woodward surmises, is because
they tend to give money for many business that wind up doing
initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of small business financing comes from
traditional sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``They mortgage their houses, God bless 'em. Then they get money
from family and friends,'' she said. Or it's debt financing from a
bank or trade credit.
</P>
<P>
   The findings illustrate ``a crying need'' for investment banks
to help investors and entrepreneurs find each other, Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   One promising trend is the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is going to make a huge difference,'' Woodward
said. ``It's going to be the vehicle that will make it much easier
to get investors and entrepreneurs together.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based Hambrecht and Wit Capital of New York are
examples of two online investment bankers. And it's not as scary as
some might think.
</P>
<P>
   Says Woodward: ``It's much less scary than just plain trading
over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   There are roughly 5 million small businesses in this country
with payrolls. They have more than $2.7 trillion in book assets,
according to data from The Fed and the Internal Revenue Service.

POLICE CAN'T BRING PRESS ON RAIDS OF PRIVATE HOMES, COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Police are violating privacy rights protected by
the Fourth Amendment when they let TV camera crews and other
journalists accompany them on so-called ``media ride-alongs'' into
private homes to observe arrests or searches, the Supreme Court
ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a violation of the Fourth Amendment for police to bring
members of the media or other third parties into a home during the
execution of a warrant when the presence of the third parties in
the home was not in aid of the execution of the warrant,'' Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court in unanimous
decisions in cases from Montana and Maryland
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth Amendment allows law enforcement officials to enter
private property and homes to conduct a search or seizure only
after a warrant has been signed by a judge _ unless the police are
in active pursuit of a criminal suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows officers to bring along a third party only in
situations where the person is acting ``in aid of'' law enforcement
_ such as an informant to identify a suspect, a translator if
necessary, or someone who can identify stolen goods.
</P>
<P>
   News media lawyers have argued that reporters on assignments
with police do aid law enforcement by publicizing the government's
efforts to combat crime, facilitating accurate reporting on law
enforcement activities and protecting suspects from abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But in Monday's opinion, Rehnquist disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely, the possibility of good public relations for the
police is simply not enough, standing alone, to justify the
ride-along intrusion into a private home,'' Rehnquist said. ``And
even the need for accurate reporting on police issues in general
bears no direct relation to the constitutional justification for
the police intrusion into a home in order to execute a ...
warrant.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision means that from now on law enforcement
officers can held liable to pay monetary damages for violating the
Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   But the court, by an 8-1 vote, also ruled that the law on
whether the media had a right to accompany police was unclear in
1992 and 1993 when the incidents that led to the two cases took
place. Therefore, the justices ruled, the Montana and Maryland
police who allowed the press to come along were immune to the
lawsuits against them.
</P>
<P>
   Only Justice John Paul Stevens voted to let both lawsuits
proceed to trial. He said the constitutional violations were clear
back in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union said Monday that the rulings
mean police must be guided by the Fourth Amendment, not by the
demands of the ``infotainment'' industry.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Dratel of the National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers, added that ``the government is not allowed to make a
display of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Richard Cordray, who represented the police officers in
both cases, said the rulings still will allow media to accompany
police officers as long as the journalists stay outside when
officers enter private homes.
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Lee Levine, representing the Associated Press and
other news organizations who sided with law enforcement officers,
said the rulings may discourage police from allowing the media to
accompany them even for permissible purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad for the public in the sense that the public won't get
to see, through the press' eyes, that important aspect of the
government's work,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision comes at a time when some police
departments are restricting news media access during police raids.
For example, Los Angeles Police Department guidelines, issued in
March, bar TV camera crews from entering homes and other private
property without owners' permission.
</P>
<P>
   In the Maryland case, Montgomery County sheriff's deputies and
deputy U.S. Marshals were accompanied by a Washington Post
photographer and reporter when they entered the Rockville home of
Charles and Geraldine Wilson the morning of April 16, 1992, in
search of the couple's son, Dominic. He was wanted on felony
charges of robbery, theft and assault with intent to rob.
</P>
<P>
   After entering the Wilsons' home, the photographer took several
pictures, although they were never published. Dominic was not in
the house when police arrived, but at his parents' request, he
surrendered later that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilsons sued the police, claiming their Fourth Amendment
rights had been violated. An appellate court agreed that the media
should not have accompanied the police but dismissed their suit
saying the law on the issue was unclear. On Monday the Supreme
Court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Montana case, about 20 federal agents accompanied by a
CNN camera crew arrived at Paul Berger's sheep and cattle ranch
near Jordan on March 24, 1993, to search for evidence that Berger
was poisining eagles. At his trial, Berger was acquitted of all
charges except improper use of a pesticide, a minor offense.
</P>
<P>
   CNN eventually used footage of the raid in a story about
government efforts to protect endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled
that Berger could sue the federal authorities who organized the
raid and allowed the television crew to come along. ``The record
... suggests that the government officers planned and executed the
search in a manner designed to enhance its entertainment, rather
than its law-enforcement, value,'' the appeals court said. The high
court agreed with that reasoning but said the lawsuit should not
proceed.

JAMES E. DOWD, WAS PRESIDENT OF BOSTON STOCK EXCHANGE; 77

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- James E. Concord, former president of the Boston Stock
Exchange, died of cancer Sunday in the Lahey Clinic in Burlington.
He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dowd was president of the Boston Stock Exchange from 1969 to
1982. During his tenure he organized the New England Securities
Depository Trust Co., a subsidiary that offers a computerized book
entry system for members, and established BOSECO (for Boston Stock
Exchange Co.), which offers members access to the world's major
stock exchanges through associate member seats held by the Boston
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dowd, of Concord, was born in Cambridge. He interrupted his
studies at Boston College to serve in the Army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the Irish-looking face,'' as he said in a story
published in the Globe on Jan. 13, 1966, he became an interpreter
of Italian. He was then sent to the Pacific Theater ``to get the
best use of my training,'' he told the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Following the war, he graduated from Boston College and its law
school.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to becoming president of the Boston Stock Exchange, Mr.
Dowd was responsible for preventing abuses in the securities
industry as New England regional administrator of the Security
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that New Englanders have the reputation of
looking at both ends of a nickel before they spend it,'' he said in
1966, ``a lot of money has been taken out of New England
fraudulently.''
</P>
<P>
   After stepping down as president of the Boston Stock Exchange,
Mr. Dowd was a consultant to the American Stock Exchange and a
director of Federated Investors Inc., the Dresdner R.C.M. Europe
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Marguerite (O'Donoghue); a daughter, Anne E.
Goodhue of Concord; two sisters, Alice I. Dowd of Arlington and
Grace E. Shea of Hyde Park; and two granddaughters.

 &HT;    Carter cleans out baseball locker _ for now By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Quincy Carter does not plan to return to the
Chicago Cubs farm team in Daytona Beach, Fla. this summer, but the
Georgia quarterback said he has not closed the book on his
professional baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, an outfielder for the Cubs' Class A affiliate, cleaned
out his locker and left the baseball team before a game Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been going at it in two sports for such a long time now,
I just felt I needed some rest,'' Carter said Monday. ``Since the
end of last season, I've been going to class, hitting the books,
going through winter workouts, going through spring (football)
practice. I spent my spring break at spring training. I'm just
physically and mentally drained.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said the Cubs ``have been very understanding.'' The team
placed him on the temporary inactive list and told him to take all
the time he needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it as that big an ordeal,'' said Jim Hendry,
the Cubs director of scouting and player development. ``Basically,
he told me he mentally and physically needs a blow, which is
understandable considering what he's done the last year. But he
hasn't closed the door on baseball. And there's no doubt in our
minds he can be a major-league baseball player. It doesn't hurt his
status with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, a sophomore, said he plans to move back to Athens today
and spend the rest of the summer ``resting my body and getting
ready for football.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's departure from the baseball team fueled speculation
that he was leaning toward a football-only career and possibly an
early exit into the NFL. He recently left agent Lonnie Cooper, who
specializes in baseball contracts, and signed on with agent Eugene
Parker, who represents Deion Sanders, another two-sport star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still love baseball, and I still want to play it,'' Carter
said. ``I just want to take some time off this summer to evaluate
myself as a two-sport athlete.'' Carter hit .215 in rookie league
in 1996 and .211 at Class A Rockford (Ill.) in 1997. He went 0 for
3 in his only appearance at Daytona. In football, Carter was named
SEC Freshman of the Year after throwing for 2,484 yards and 12
touchdowns. Georgia is touting him as a Heisman Trophy candidate
this season.

 &HT;    Moment of truth for Redskins franchise while consequences of
raising expansion fees await owners
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a setting appropriate to their mission, NFL owners
in the next two days will huddle at a hotel, raise the ante on
franchise fees and reinforce the league's status as the strongest
and best-positioned in sports history.
</P>
<P>
   Probably before lunch today, the owners will approve the sale of
the Washington Redskins to Bethesda, Md., businessman Daniel Snyder
for a record $800 million. That amount exceeds by more than 50
percent the $530 million fee Al Lerner paid last year for the
resurrected Cleveland Browns franchise.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the session adjourns Wednesday evening, however, the
bar could be pushed even higher, particularly if owners agree on a
minimum fee for the expansion franchise targeted for Los Angeles in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the expansion committee met Monday evening to hear
presentations from businessman Eli Broad and entertainment mogul
Michael Ovitz, the two prominent suitors for the Los Angeles
franchise. League officials are expected to announce today that
they are endorsing Ovitz's plan for refurbishing the Los Angeles
Coliseum. Despite his original plans for a shopping, sports and
entertainment complex in suburban Carson, Ovitz has fallen in line
with the league's preference for a revamped Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz offered the design to the NFL for free and without
strings, meaning that the league could adopt the concept but still
award the franchise to a different bidder. however, the owners
probably won't overlook that display of largess, especially
considering that they covet Ovitz's entertainment connections and
his ability to connect the league to a younger and hipper audience
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Using several buzz-phrases adopted by the league, Ovitz told the
Los Angeles Times that his plan ``is dedicated to making it a
fan-friendly day'' at a game.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz faces a couple of potential hurdles. While his group is
prepared to finance a $298 million stadium, it will require public
monies for five to seven parking garages, which will provide 27,000
spaces on site and are central his plan. And Broad, who commands
political support in Los Angeles and is committed to funding the
stadium, is claiming special and exclusive rights to bring NFL
football to the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old Snyder, who survived an ill-fated partnership
with Howard Milstein, apparently faces no opposition to his
Redskins deal. The finance committee last week unanimously
recommended his bid, assuring the culmination to a long and
occasionally acrimonious process that began with the death of late
Skins owner Jack Kent Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL also will brief owners on plans for a new stadium for
the New England Patriots and on Wednesday will present the upgraded
system for the return of instant replay. The system features
digital tape and touch-pad technology.

 &HT;    We've got your number: From 00 to 100, there are numbers linked
to great figures and events of sports
 &HT;    (EDS: IN TWO TAKES _ TAKE 1)
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes, a great notion comes in a comfortable,
inspirational setting. Like many of the great revelations of the
20th century, this idea took flight in a virtual think tank. In a
press box, during a rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   In Turner Field last October, while the Braves and Padres waited
for the rain to stop and Game 1 of the NLCS to begin, three minds
spent nearly two hours pondering one of life's eternal mysteries:
Who's the best athlete, for each number, 1-99? Or your favorite
athlete _ or sports memory, or year _ inextricably tied to each
number? Wait. Make that 0 _ no, 00 _ to 100.
</P>
<P>
   There was Marty Noble, baseball writer from Newsday. There was
the lovely and talented Janet Ward, a magazine editor who also
works Braves games for SportsTicker and is, even better, my wife.
And I was the third. Like both of them and most of you, I identify
certain numbers with certain athletes.
</P>
<P>
   What's in a number? Almost everything, if you're into sports.
You say 8, I say Yogi, some guy in Athens says _ Buck Belue? Well,
yes. You say 23, we all say Michael. On some numbers, we can agree
that they are the one and only. For most others, we have our
personal preferences, or rank them 1-2-3. Gold, silver and bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Noble calls it his sports DNA. Numbers say a lot about our
sporting makeup: who we are, where we grew up, our ages and
stations in life. I'm 48 and was born in New York, where I spent
most of my life before moving to Atlanta in 1983. That explains a
lot about my list: the early New York influence, the
Atlanta-come-lately stuff, the dearth of current NBA bricklayers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a subjective list. That's part of the beauty of sports.
Who was better, Bird or Magic? And it doesn't include just
Hall-of-Famers and All-Stars. While we associate greatness with
specific numbers, some numbers also evoke sporting moments and
milestones, favorite athletes or unforgettable teams. These are
numbers we mark our lives by.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of thing sportswriters do while waiting for the
skies to clear. Hey, look. The rain's stopped. Play ball! Here's my
list. By the numbers, 00-100. What's yours?
</P>
<P>
   00 Jim Otto, the Raiders center, was an even better blocker than
a palindrome. And Johnny Vander Meer, the only pitcher to throw
back-to-back no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   0 Johnny Olszewski was literally ``Johnny O,'' his nickname and
number while a Redskins' fullback in the '50s and early '60s. Nolan
Ryan never wore zero but should have; he fired seven no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   1/8 The uniform number worn by Eddie Gaedel, Bill Veeck's
short-lived, pinch-hit midget who had a fraction of a career. On
Aug. 19, 1951, the 3-foot-7 Gaedel walked in his only at-bat before
AL president Will Harridge banned him the next day.
</P>
<P>
   1 John Wooden finished No. 1 with UCLA 10 times. Pee Wee Reese,
No. 1 in your program, was No. 1 in Brooklyn's hearts and the
little leader of the original, the real Dodgers. No one, not even
Pee Wee, fielded like the Wizard of Oz, Ozzie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   1A Muhammad Ali's draft classification.
</P>
<P>
   1.12 How do you define domination? Bob Gibson's earned-run
average in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   2 Nellie Fox, chaw bulging in his left cheek, turning two for
the White Sox. The $2 window at the track. And Ernie Banks, Mr.
Cub, who wore No. 14 but always suggested, ``Let's play two!''
</P>
<P>
   3 Babe Ruth. Period. No one else belongs here. (Sorry, Murph.)
</P>
<P>
   3:59.4 To Sir with admiration. Long before he was knighted,
Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile barrier on May 6, 1954.
</P>
<P>
   4 Lou Gehrig. The Iron Horse was the Babe's cleanup hitter and
the pluckiest man on the face of the earth in the face of death.
Bobby Orr, bad knees and all, was hockey's nonpareil defenseman. In
the '50s, New York debated the merits of its three future Hall of
Fame center fielders: Willie, Mickey and The Duke _ Edwin Snider,
the Duke of Flatbush.
</P>
<P>
   5 Joe DiMaggio. Joltin' Joe has left and gone away but will
forever be 5. End of debate. Yet in the interest of marital bliss,
let's not forget my wife's favorite O, Brooks Robinson. And I can
still see Paul Hornung running the Packer sweep.
</P>
<P>
   6 Bill Russell revolutionized basketball defensively and was
most responsible for the Celtic dynasty. Stan Musial was the Man,
Julius Erving the Doctor.
</P>
<P>
   7 The Mick. Mickey Mantle. But there's room in seventh heaven
for John Elway. Even Mark Spitz, who swam to seven Olympic gold
medals in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   7 7/8 Bear Bryant's houndstooth hat size.
</P>
<P>
   8 Yogi Berra. He is 8. Said so right on his back when he
squatted behind home plate. No 8 was as steadfast as Cal Ripken,
though, and Carl
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzemski was a great 8, too.
</P>
<P>
   9 By any name _ The Splendid Splinter, Teddy Ballgame _ Ted
Williams was No. 9. Yet this hockey holy trinity left crowds on
Cloud 9: Gordie Howe. ``The Golden Jet,'' Bobby Hull. And Maurice
``Rocket'' Richard.
</P>
<P>
   10 Even 29 years after giving Brazil its third World Cup, Pele
remains soccer's greatest star (1,281 goals in 21 years and World
Cups in 1958, '62 and '70). Whether as Walt Frazier or his alter
ego ``Clyde,'' the Knicks guard glistened on and off the Madison
Square Garden court. Nadia Comenici and Mary Lou Retton were
perfect 10s when it mattered most.
</P>
<P>
   11 Phil Simms, the near-perfect (22-for-25) MVP of Super Bowl
XXI. And a Messiah and an Isiah: Mark Messier hoisted Lord
Stanley's Cup five times, and Isiah Thomas made the Pistons' Bad
Boys of the late '80s watchable. Barely.
</P>
<P>
   12 Joe Namath. I guarantee it. So did Broadway Joe, in Super
Bowl III. As a kid, I went to Philadelphia to see Roger Staubach
and Navy beat Army, long before he became Roger the Dodger in
Dallas. When Jim Thorpe, already a two-time football All-American,
won the decathlon and pentathlon at the 1912 Olympics, Sweden's
King Gustav V crowned him, ``The greatest athlete in the world.''
Thorpe's reply? ``Thanks, King.''
</P>
<P>
   13 Wilt the Stilt. Wilt Chamberlain was nigh-unstoppable
everywhere _ but the foul line. Nobody's thrown it better than Dan
Marino.
</P>
<P>
   14 Every kid wears a certain number for a certain hero. Mine was
14, for Y.A. Tittle, who passed the New York Football Giants to
three NFL Championship Games in a row in the early '60s. Alas, I
didn't have Y.A.'s arm. Fortunately, I don't have his hairline.
Yet. The Big O, Oscar Robinson, wore 14 for most of his career.
Pete Rose hustled a hit or two wearing 14, too.
</P>
<P>
   15 Bart Starr swung the baton for Lombardi's Packers. As a
Bullet and a Knick, Earl Monroe was ``The Pearl'' personified.
Thurman Munson, a terrific catcher and even better father, died far
too young.
</P>
<P>
   16 Joe Montana. QB XVI might be the best quarterback of all
time. Whitey Ford was the original Mr. October. George Blanda
played football until age 48 and went out kickin'.
</P>
<P>
   17 Ted Turner. As in, WTBS, Channel 17. When the Braves signed
Andy Messersmith, baseball's first free agent, Turner turned
tailor. While other Braves had their last name sewn above the
number on the back of the jersey, Turner ordered that Messersmith
be replaced with ``Channel.'' Baseball quickly canceled Channel 17,
the uniform. In Boston, John Havlicek never stopped moving, or
winning.
</P>
<P>
   18 Father and son, Archie and Peyton Manning. Martina
Navratilova and Chris Evert won 18 Grand Slam singles titles each.
</P>
<P>
   19 Johnny Unitas. If not Montana, then Johnny U _ backpedaling
in hightop black cleats _ was the best QB. Willis Reed dragged his
injured right leg onto the court in 1970 and promptly hit his only
two shots to ignite the Knicks' Game 7 rout of L.A. for their first
NBA championship. Tony Gwynn is the premier hitter of the age.
</P>
<P>
   19.32 Michael Johnson's world record time in the 200 meters at
the 1996 Olympics. The Man with the Golden Shoes became the first
male to double in the 200 and 400.
</P>
<P>
   20 Frank Robinson is the only man to win the MVP in both the
American and National Leagues. Who's a better runner, Lou Brock or
Barry Sanders? And Sergey Bubka raised the pole-vaulted ceiling to
20 feet, and higher.
</P>
<P>
   21 Roberto Clemente was a complete player and a complete person.
Every multi-millionaire ballplayer is indebted to Curt Flood; if
Flood had fought baseball's reserve clause even earlier, imagine
how much money another 21 _ Warren Spahn _ would've made. And
'Nique, our own human highlight film, Dominique Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   22 Elgin Baylor, who begat Doctor J, who begat Michael. Dave
DeBusschere once played ``DEE-fense!'' and hit the open man when
Red Holzman's Knicks made beautiful string music together. Run,
Emmitt Smith, run.
</P>
<P>
   23 Michael Jordan, the one and only 23, the most rarefied Air of
all.
</P>
<P>
   24 Willie Mays. Say ``Hey'' for the man some now consider the
greatest living baseball player. Ken Griffey Jr. may be his heir.
</P>
<P>
   25 No one did more to help Bobby Cremins build Georgia Tech
basketball than Mark Price. In the mind's eye, Fred Biletnikoff,
forearms taped in white, is still catching passes.
</P>
<P>
   26 Some numbers are more popular than others. Herb Adderley, one
of the few memorable 26s, was a great All-Pro defensive back with
the Green Bay Packers in the '60s. Who ended Pete Rose's 44-game
hitting streak? No. 26, Gene Garber.
</P>
<P>
   27 The 1927 Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig, baseball's best. Carlton
Fisk, before he exchanged his Red Sox for White and reversed his
number to 72. And Navy's Joe Bellino, who won the 1960 Heisman
Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   28 Steve Blass. Long before there was Mark Wohlers, there was
Blass, who went from 1971 World Series hero to mysteriously losing
his control, and career.
</P>
<P>
   29 John Smoltz, who's got grit and great stuff galore, back in
Cy Young form. Few swings are/were sweeter than Rod Carew's, hitter
extraordinaire.
</P>
<P>
   29-2 1/2 Bob
</P>
<P>
   Beamon. At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City's altitude, in the
single most extraordinary feat in track-and-field history, Beamon
obliterated the long jump record by nearly two feet.
</P>
<P>
   30 In 1930, Atlanta's Bobby Jones became the only golfer to
capture a recognized Grand Slam by winning the U.S. and British
Opens, and U.S. and British Amateurs. Maury Wills, the first to
steal 100 bases in a season.

<P>
   30-30 Bobby Bonds, the 30-homer, 30-steal prototype.
</P>
<P>
   31 A thoroughbred and a Doggie. Secretariat's 31-length victory
in the 1973 Belmont Stakes made Big Red the first Triple Crown
winner since Citation in '48. Greg (Mad Dog) Maddux is the best
pitcher of his time. And Jim Taylor was Hornung's lead blocker and
the most bruising fullback this side of ...
</P>
<P>
   32 Jim Brown, football's finest running back and arguably its
greatest player. Sandy Koufax, too briefly baseball's greatest
left-hander. And Magic Johnson, who transformed the point. With
apologies to such 32s as Elston Howard, Bill Walton, Steve Carlton,
Karl Malone and Cookie Gilchrist (but not O.J.) at the most
log-jammed number of all.
</P>
<P>
   33 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. No NBA player ever had more points or a
more lethal shot than Kareem's Sky Hook. Larry Bird did everything,
all the time, playing the game the way it was meant to be played.
By any pronunciation, Tony Dorsett could run the ball.
</P>
<P>
   34 Anywhere else, it's Sweetness. Here, it's Herschel Walker,
then Walter Payton, finally Bo Jackson (pick a sport; I'll choose
Auburn football).
</P>
<P>
   35 Follow the bouncing ball. Phil Niekro and Knucksie's
fluttering knuckler.
</P>
<P>
   36 Jesse Owens' four gold medals in the 1936 Olympics infuriated
Hitler. Meadowlark Lemon was the Harlem Globetrotters.
</P>
<P>
   37 Casey Stengel won big with the Yankees, birthed the Amazin'
Mets and spoke in hilarious tongues. The late, great Doak Walker,
whom Ricky Williams honored last season.
</P>
<P>
   38 The flip sides of 38: Gary Anderson, wide left from 38 yards
out in the fourth quarter of the 1998 NFC Championship Game. And
Morten Andersen, perfect from 38 in overtime to put the Falcons in
Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   39 Zonk and Campy. Larry Csonka was Don Shula's battering ram,
Roy Campanella Brooklyn's beloved backstop.
</P>
<P>
   40 Gale Sayers, both before and after the knee, ran like the
wind. Theron Sapp, ``The Drought Breaker,'' whose touchdown beat
Georgia Tech 7-0 in 1957 and ended Georgia's eight-year losing
streak against the Jackets. In 1978, Tech's Eddie Lee Ivery rushed
through the snow for a then-NCAA record 356 yards at Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   41 Eddie Mathews, power hitter and Hall of Famer. Tom Seaver,
power pitcher and Hall of Famer. Matt Snell, power fullback on the
Super Bowl Jets.
</P>
<P>
   42 Jackie Robinson. Thank you, for everything.
</P>
<P>
   42L Connie Mack's suit size. Essential for a man who never
managed in a uniform.
</P>
<P>
   43 Richard Petty. The King in the 43 car. Mark Wohlers, all of
it: the final out of the '95 World Series; the hanging slider to
Jim Leyritz; the too-painful-to-watch loss of control. And Carl
``Spider'' Lockhart, the late, pretty-great safety of the New York
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   44 The great Henry Aaron. The one and only Hammer. (With
apologies to Zeke from Cabin Creek, Jerry West.)
</P>
<P>
   44.2 _ Pistol Pete Maravich's career scoring average at LSU.
</P>
<P>
   45 Archie Griffin, the only two-time Heisman Trophy winner.
Homer Jones, one-time New York Giants receiver who invented the
celebratory touchdown spike.
</P>
<P>
   46 Jack Nicklaus' age in 1986, when he became the oldest winner
of the Masters. His sixth Masters title gave Nicklaus a record 20th
win in a major.
</P>
<P>
   47 Tom Glavine. The mantle of Mr. Brave has been passed with
care, from Aaron to Niekro to Dale Murphy to the little
left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   48 Oklahoma's try for a record 48th consecutive football victory
under Uncle Bud (coach Bud Wilkinson) ended in a 7-0 loss to Notre
Dame in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   49 Joe Louis' career KOs in 66 fights. Ron Guidry was Louisiana
left-handed lightning for the Yankees, Bobby Mitchell a blur out of
the backfield in both Cleveland and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   50 In 1950, City College of New York became the only school to
win the NCAA and NIT tournaments in the same season. And that
right-hander on your 1950 Boston Braves? No. 50, Ernie Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   51 Dick Butkus, the true monster of the Midway. And Russ Hodges'
radio delirium in 1951: ``The Giants win the pennant! The Giants
win the pennant!'' after Bobby Thomson's bottom-of-the-ninth homer
off Brooklyn's Ralph Branca gave the Giants the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   52 His were banker's hours. As Keith Wilkes at UCLA, he learned
to bank wing jumpers under Wooden; as Jamal Wilkes in the NBA, he
banked nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   53 The 53 Defense, so named for linebacker Bob Matheson's jersey
number with the 1972 Miami Dolphins, the only team in NFL history
to go 17-0.
</P>
<P>
   54 The number of years the New York Rangers wandered hockey's
wasteland before finally winning the Stanley Cup in 1994, their
first since '40.
</P>
<P>
   55 Who's a Bum?! At blessed last, Brooklyn wins its first World
Series over the hated Yankees in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   56 Joe DiMaggio's epic 56-game hitting streak, baseball's
unbreakable record.
</P>
<P>
   57 Jeff Van Note, once the vintage Falcon. In 1957, North
Carolina's triple-overtime upset of Wilt Chamberlain and Kansas in
the NCAA final.
</P>
<P>
   58 Jessie Tuggle, now our vintage Falcon. Jack Lambert, the
saber-toothless tiger in the middle of Pittsburgh's Steel Curtain.
Bill Bradley's 58 points off Wichita State in the 1965 NCAA
consolation game, still a Final Four record.
</P>
<P>
   59 Al Geiberger's PGA record low round of 59, since tied by Chip
Beck and David Duval, who shot 59 in the final round last January
to win the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.
</P>
<P>
   60 Tommy Nobis, the first and fiercest Falcon of all.
</P>
<P>
   61 Roger Maris, 61 in '61.
</P>
<P>
   62 Charlie Trippi, the Georgia halfback who some consider
Georgia's greatest all-around athlete. Trippi was runner-up to
Army's Glenn Davis in the 1946 Heisman Trophy voting but won the
Maxwell Award that year as the nation's best player.
</P>
<P>
   63 Just days after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on
Nov. 22, 1963, NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle had the league play
its Sunday games as scheduled. A young Bulls guard named Michael
Jordan scored 63 against Boston in the 1986 playoffs, still an NBA
playoff record.
</P>
<P>
   64 Green Bay right guard Jerry Kramer, leading Bart Starr's
sneak into the end zone in the final seconds to beat Dallas 21-17
in the Ice Bowl, the 1967 NFL title game.
</P>
<P>
   65 Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium opened in 1965 as the home of
the Atlanta _ Crackers. The beloved minor-league club left Ponce de
Leon Park to play its last season in the big ballyard in the round.
Tiger Woods shot 65 in the third round of the '97 Masters enroute
to his record-setting 270, 18-under victory.
</P>
<P>
   66 Sammy Sosa's 66 homers in '98. The skill of Mario Lemieux,
the brutality of Ray Nitschke. And 1966, Bobby Dodd's last season
as head coach at Georgia Tech, several months after all-black Texas
Western's 72-65 triumph over Adolph Rupp's all-white Kentucky
Wildcats in the most significant NCAA final.
</P>
<P>
   67 In 1967, Vince Lombardi's third NFL championship in a row
with Green Bay and fifth in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   68 Tommie Smith and John Carlos raise their black-gloved fists
in protest after winning the gold and bronze medals in the men's
200 meters at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   69 The Miracle Mets, whose pitching kiddie corps shut down
Baltimore to win the '69 World Series. Somewhere, Gil Hodges is
still smiling.
</P>
<P>
   70 Mark McGwire's 70 homers in '98. Now a stretch of I-70 in St.
Louis is named in Big Mac's honor.
</P>
<P>
   71 Elgin Baylor's then-NBA record point total against the Knicks
on Nov. 15, 1960, in the old Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   72 The 1972 Munich Olympic massacre of 11 Israelis by Arab
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   73 David Thompson's point total against Detroit in 1978, second
only to Wilt.
</P>
<P>
   74 The D-line: Bob Lilly. Merlin Olsen. And Alex Karras, who
talked an even better game.
</P>
<P>
   75 More D: Mean Joe Greene. David ``Deacon'' Jones. And John
Wooden's 10th and last NCAA title, in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   76 When Indiana topped Michigan for the 1976 NCAA championship,
the Hoosiers finished 32-0 _ the last Division I team to go
undefeated and win the national title. Big Daddy Lipscomb, RIP.
</P>
<P>
   77 ``The Galloping Ghost,'' Red Grange. John McEnroe won 77
singles and 77 doubles tennis titles.
</P>
<P>
   78 Eddie Robinson was 78 in 1997 when he coached his 55th and
last season at Grambling, where Coach Rob won a record 408 games.
</P>
<P>
   79 The 1979 Magic-Bird, Michigan State-Indiana State NCAA final
remains the most-watched NCAA title game in TV history.
</P>
<P>
   80 No one was meaner, badder or better than Georgia's Junkyard
Dawgs of 1980, the national champions. Jerry Rice is the best
receiver ever. Wayne Chrebet? Hofstra guy.
</P>
<P>
   81 Mr. End Zone Dance Fever himself, Billy ``White Shoes''
Johnson. And two old Italian stallions: defensive ends Gino
Marchetti and Andy Robustelli.
</P>
<P>
   82 Raymond Berry, who ran the most precise routes ever. The
Braves' record 13-0 start en route to the 1982 NL West title.
</P>
<P>
   83 The last of the New York Islanders' four straight Stanley
Cups came in 1983 at the expense of Edmonton. In the NFL's best
quarterback draft ever, six were taken in the first round,
including three sure Hall of Famers: Elway, Marino and Jim Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   84 Forty-eight years hence, Carl Lewis duplicates Jesse Owens'
Olympic record by taking four gold medals at the Los Angeles Games
in the 100, 200, long jump and 400-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   85 Del Shofner (``Tittle _ to Shofner _ touchdown!''). And Ol'
Red Eyes, Max McGee.
</P>
<P>
   86 Through the wickets of Bill Buckner and the Mets, truly
amazingly, win the '86 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   87 Claude Humphrey, rushing the passer in Atlanta-Fulton County.
</P>
<P>
   88 Lynn Swann, the Baryshnikov of the post pattern. Alan Page,
an NFL MVP defensive tackle with the Vikings' Purple People Eaters,
now a Minnesota Supreme Court judge. And UCLA's 88-game winning
streak, stopped in '74 on a jumper by Notre Dame's Dwight Clay.
</P>
<P>
   89 Mike Ditka, who played tight end with a single-bar facemask
and singular ferocity. Otis Taylor, the Chiefs fleet wideout,
personified the AFL's wondrously wide-open style.
</P>
<P>
   90 1990, the year of Georgia Tech's co-national football
championship; if Colorado hadn't had five downs against Missouri,
the Jackets would've won it outright. And Mr. 90 Feet himself,
Abner Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   91 1991, the best Braves season ever. From worst to first.
</P>
<P>
   92 Francisco Cabrera in the 1992 NLCS. Or, as Skip told us, ``A
lot of room in right-center. If he hits one there, we can dance in
the streets. The two-one. Swung. Line drive! Left field! One run is
in. Here comes Bream. Here's the throw to the plate. He
isssssssssssss _ safe! Braves win! Braves win! Braves win! Braves
win!'' Pause. ``BRAVES WIN!!!'' Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the finest
female athlete, won her second Olympic heptathlon in Barcelona in
'92.
</P>
<P>
   93 Distance of the most famous touchdown pass in Georgia history
and Buck Belue's life, the last 20 yards of which Larry Munson
described thusly before falling off his chair: ``Lindsay Scott!
Lindsay Scott! LINDSAY SCOTT!!!''
</P>
<P>
   94 In baseball's darkest moment since the Black Sox scandal, the
disgraceful cancellation of the 1994 World Series, because of the
players' strike and owners' intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   95 At long last, your 1995 Atlanta Braves, World Champions.
Who's next? Goldberg, No. 95 as an undersized defensive lineman
with Georgia and the Falcons, now the larger-than-life king of WCW
Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   96 When the world truly came to Atlanta. The 1996 Centennial
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   97 The number of pitches thrown by Don Larsen in Game 5 of the
1956 World Series. That 2-0 win over Brooklyn is the only perfect
game in Series history.
</P>
<P>
   98 The 1998 world champion New York Yankees, whose 125 total
wins are the most ever in a season.
</P>
<P>
   98.84 The percentage of votes Tom Seaver received in the 1992
Hall of Fame balloting, the highest in the voting for Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   99 The Great One, Wayne Gretzky. (Sorry, George Mikan.)
</P>
<P>
   100 Wilt the Stilt. On March 2, 1962, in Hershey, Pa., Wilt
Chamberlain scored 100 points against the Knicks. It's the most
ever scored in an NBA game and in the Hershey Arena. More than
ever, unstoppable.

 &HT;    A point-and-click away, live games, interviews and fan chats are
online

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Waiting for the 11 p.m. TV news or the morning
newspaper for your sports scores is becoming as old-fashioned as
basketball shorts that don't cover the knees or a pullover,
double-knit baseball jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, instant scores and statistics are just a
click of the mouse away.
</P>
<P>
   All you need in addition to a computer is an Internet provider,
a browser and a little knowledge about the best Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to sign up for unlimited Internet access time. With the
NBA and NHL playoffs heating up and a long baseball season ahead,
you probably will be spending a lot of time in front of a computer
screen if you are a real sports fan.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the advent of cable and ESPN has there been such a
change in the way fans can follow sports. Call it the pre-Web and
post-Web eras.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, who would have dreamed that you could:
</P>
<P>
   _ Get up-to-the-minute statistics and play-by-play progress on
most pro games, plus plenty of college action.
</P>
<P>
   _ Listen to broadcasts of all major-league baseball games on a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Instantly converse with other sports fans in all parts of the
world as you follow the action.
</P>
<P>
   What a treat it is to hear Georgia native Ernie Harwell, 81,
call a Detroit Tigers game in his final season at the mike while
you sit at home in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Broadcast.com, you no longer have to fiddle with a
radio dial trying to pick up a distant signal.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to pro and college broadcasts, you'll have to download
RealPlayer software. But it's free at www.real.com. Don't bother to
pay for the enhanced version, RealPlayer Plus.
</P>
<P>
   The games to be covered each day can be found at
www.broadcast.com or at sites for the individual leagues or
colleges. There is about a 90-second delay on the broadcasts, but
that's a small drawback.
</P>
<P>
   You also can ``watch'' a game live on your computer. Several
``virtual'' sites provide animated game action. To access the game
screens, you will need to download a free program called Shockwave
(www.macromedia.com
</P>
<P>
   /shockwave).
</P>
<P>
   CBS Sportsline offers Baseball Live
(www.cbs.sportsline.com/u/sports/mlb/1999/today). It gives a full
baseball field with animations of each pitch and hit. It offers
statistics on each player, and you can chat with other fans
watching the game.
</P>
<P>
   TotalCast is the name of another service
(www.totalbaseball.com). The graphics aren't as sharp as
Sportsline's, but it does show the location of every pitch in the
current at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Most baseball fans, however, probably would pass on the graphics
and stick with the updated scoreboards and in-progress box scores
on such sites www.majorleaguebaseball.com
</P>
<P>
   If you're a basketball fan, you won't be disappointed by NBA.com
(www.nba.com). Would you expect anything less than a slick,
new-millennium site from the NBA? Courtside Live provides running
statistics and play-by-play info on all playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's official Web site (www.nfl.com.) is as good as it
gets. If you really want to have fun with your PC, spend a fall
Sunday afternoon there.
</P>
<P>
   It has an always-changing NFL scoreboard, and you can follow any
game you want, play by play, with the statistics adjusted after
each play. If you play fantasy football, this site is a must. One
more click brings you to the virtual game. Again, statistics are
updated as you watch the ball move up and down the field. No, it's
not like being at the game, but it just might be better than
sitting in front of the TV listening to some NFL announcers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major college football program has its own Web
site, usually a subsection of the school's Web site. Don't sell
these sites short. Collegiate sports information departments have
embraced the Internet as well as any group.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also offers the opportunity to ``chat'' with some
of your heroes. ESPN (www.espn.go.com) regularly offers fans a
chance to ask questions of sports figures. So do most of the league
sites. You can e-mail your favorite baseball star through the
Players Association site (www.bigleaguers.com).
</P>
<P>
   So, chat away as you follow all the playoff and baseball action.
Just think, the millennium isn't even here yet and it's already a
new age for sports fans.

CLINTON PAID-LEAVE PROPOSAL DRAWS MIXED REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Work-family advocates Monday hailed President Clinton's speech
advocating a plan that would finance paid family leaves by tapping
unemployment benefits, but opponents argued it would cost this
state $200 million per year and put small firms at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Clinton told graduates at Grambling State University in
Louisiana he would change federal regulations to allow workers to
collect unemployment benefits while at home caring for newborn or
adopted children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In saying that unemployment insurance should be extended to
include care of newborn or newly adopted children, I think the
president's intent is to expand and update the unemployment system
to meet the needs of working families,'' said Boston lawyer Monica
Halas, who has drafted a paid family leave bill on behalf of the
Family Leave Coalition of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard C. Lord, executive vice president of legislative
policy at Associated Industries of Massachusetts, said such a plan
would strip the state of its competitive edge and put too great a
burden on Massachusetts' $1.8 billion unemployment trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be, potentially, a very expensive program,''
said Lord, whose organization represents 5,000 companies. ``At a
minimum, it will cost $200 million per year in this state alone if
the number of people who take family leave each year does not
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993,
employees of firms with 50 or more workers are guaranteed up to 12
weeks of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child,
personal illness, or the care of a sick relative. But many cannot
afford to take time off without pay.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates said Clinton had modeled his plan on two bills that
have been introduced in the Massachusetts Legislature. The bills,
one in the Senate and the other in the House, would offer workers
on leave 50 percent of their weekly wage, capping compensation at
57.5 percent of the average weekly wage in the state. Last year,
that cap would have been about $402 per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thrilled to have the president validate what we and
working families across the state have been saying all along _ that
working families need paid family and medical leave,'' said Linda
Johnson, executive director of the Women's Statewide Legislative
Network.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of the state's work force is not eligible for
leave under the FMLA because they work for firms with fewer than 50
employees.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of more than 2,000 workers by the Commission on
Family and Medical leave found that 64 percent could not take a
leave because they could not afford to go without pay.

MCCAIN, FEINGOLD SHARE COURAGE AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The long and mercurial bid of US Senators John McCain
and Russell Feingold to reform campaign finance netted Monday the
first Profile in Courage Award to be shared by elected officials of
opposite parties.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, who united to press for legislation to limit the
impact of so-called soft money on federal elections, said at the
ceremony in the John F. Kennedy Library that they are confident the
bill will pass this year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, both men stood by the principle of
fund-raising reform, putting their political careers in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold and McCain ``are two courageous men who have nothing to
fear before the courts of history,'' said Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, who helped judge the 10-year-old contest named for her
father, President John F. Kennedy, for his 1957 Pulitzer
Prize-winning book ``Profiles in Courage'' about elected officials
who risked their political careers for their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The awards come with $25,000 stipends, which McCain and Feingold
said they plan to donate to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, a Democrat from Wisconsin, nearly lost a reelection
challenge from Republican Mark Neumann after the incumbent swore
off private donations.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold kept his word even after the bipartisan bill died last
September when its supporters could not muster the 60 votes needed
to break an opposition filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative McCain, an Arizona Republican, said his policy
priorities differ sharply from those of Feingold and Senator Edward
M. Kennedy, who participated in the awards ceremony. But he said he
considered reform worthy of bucking his party leadership last year
and again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we abolish soft money, Americans will never have a
government that works as hard for them as it does for the special
interests,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold said he does not interpret the award as a personal pat
on the back for his decision to limit fund-raising in his own
campaign. ``The award is the ideal way to spur us on to get the
last few votes . . . and put an end to this system of legalized
bribery that has overtakn our democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Senator Kennedy said he is a strong supporter of
the bill, but declined to seize the occasion to forswear soft money
donations to his 2000 reelection campaign. He said he will conform
with established laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm hopeful we'll have it passed by then,'' Kennedy said
after the ceremony.

J. BAKER REVISES STRATEGIC PLAN WITH REPP ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   J. Baker Inc. said Monday its acquisition of Repp Ltd., a
175-store apparel chain for big and tall men, will revise its
previously announced strategic plan.
</P>
<P>
   J. Baker already operates several retail chains including Casual
Male Big &AMP; Tall, which accounted for nearly half of the company's
$584.3 million in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year ago, J. Baker said it would open a second big and
tall chain aimed at a more affluent customer. The new chain was to
have been called Grande Central.
</P>
<P>
   Monday J. Baker said it would ``no longer proceed'' with Grande
Central because the Repp acquisition would achieve many of the same
goals, only at a faster pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have taken time to build a name and a mailing list''
for a new chain, said J. Baker president and chief executive Alan
I. Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   The Repp acquisition will do that right away and will be
``accretive'' to J. Baker's earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Repp will keep its name and its merchandising team, but Repp and
Casual Male plan to combine some back-office functions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, J. Baker said it intended to pay $31.7
million in cash to Edison Brothers Stores Inc., Repp's bankrupt
operator.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with its other chains were what caused Edison's woes;
the Repp division is profitable, Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they got a heck of a buy,'' said Buckingham Research
Group analyst Lee F. Backus of J. Baker's purchase of Repp. ``This
is a terrific opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Repp had sales of roughly $100 million last year. Casual Male
had sales of about $270 million, Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   With Repp and Casual Male joining forces, J. Baker will become
one of the biggest players in the highly fragmented $6 billion
market for big and tall men's clothing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Plans also call for Casual Male to sharply increase the number
of outlet stores it operates. In five years, the chain could
operate as many as 250 outlet stores. That would make J. Baker a
major presence in the three major price categories of the men's big
and tall market _ discount, moderate, and upscale.
</P>
<P>
   J. Baker has had its ups and downs in recent years as it has
become less reliant on retail footwear, once its core business. In
its latest quarter, earnings were hurt by unseasonably warm
weather, which slowed sales for fall and winter merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the capital J. Baker used for the Repp deal was provided
by BankBoston Retail Finance and Back Bay Capital LLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that this new financing will enable (J.
Baker) to accomplish their strategic objectives,'' said Edward J.
Siskin, president of Back Bay Capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Nasdaq, J. Baker shares closed up 9/32, to 8 1/8. J. Baker
headquarters are in Canton, Mass.

YUGOSLAV RESERVISTS RESIST RETURNING TO KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Protests have begun again in towns and
villages in Yugoslavia as army reservists, supported by their
mothers, wives and other family members, have resisted orders to go
back to Kosovo after a short leave.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of at least 1,000 people, and perhaps more, gathered in
the towns of Krusevac and Aleksandrovac on Sunday, residents said,
when the reservists received orders to report for duty in Kosovo
after only three days' leave. Demonstrators were out on the streets
again Monday, the majority of them women, demanding that their men
be spared another tour of duty in the war-battered Serbian
province.
</P>
<P>
   The protests follow days of demonstrations last week by the
women of the region south of the capital, Belgrade, and not far
from the border with Kosovo, which is the southernmost province of
Serbia. Many of the reservists called up for duty in Kosovo in the
last two months are from this region.
</P>
<P>
   The initial protests ended when the military authorities allowed
hundreds of reservists to return home from Kosovo. While the
authorities seemed to have stemmed the public anger last week, the
new call-up showed that the issue was far from resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest appears to be spreading in the region. As crowds
appeared back on the streets in Krusevac and Aleksandrovac,
protests by reservists and their families were also reported in the
town of Raska, close to the border with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A determined group of protesters in the town of Cacak, closer to
Belgrade, tried to demonstrate against the war on Sunday but was
broken up by police. The group, which calls itself Citizens'
Parliament, has been making weekly protests, calling for a
negotiated peace. Members were prevented by police officers from
even gathering in a restaurant on Sunday and resorted to lighting
candles together in a church.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators in Krusevac chanted, ``Give us our children
back!'' and ``We want peace!'' said a resident who watched the
protest on Sunday. Reservists were particularly angry that they
were being ordered back into Kosovo, when the authorities had told
them just days before that they would not have to go back, the
resident said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, reached by telephone, estimated that perhaps as many as
2,000 people demonstrated for several hours in the city center
Monday and the same number on Sunday. The demonstration was
peaceful but firm, he said. ``They are determined not to go back to
Kosovo,'' he said of the reservists.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav military is clearly seeking to negotiate with the
men and prevent the dissent from turning into open disobedience or
desertion.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Yugoslav third army arrived from the
military headquarters in Nis to speak to the reservists but
apparently failed to persuade them to comply with their orders,
residents said. Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, the army's top general and
commander of the operation in Kosovo, arrived in Raska on Sunday to
talk to demonstrators there, the independent VIP news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The reservists, who face criminal charges if they refuse the
call-up, are not refusing outright to serve in Kosovo, residents
who described the protests say, but are asking that other
reservists do a tour of duty first. Many accuse the local
authorities, and in particular the governing Socialist Party, of
showing favoritism and allowing young men with connections to avoid
being ordered into active service.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators in Aleksandrovac, a smaller town west of Krusevac,
were demanding that their men be the first to be withdrawn from
Kosovo as the Yugoslav army winds down its campaign, one resident
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has repeatedly announced over the last two weeks
that it is withdrawing troops from Kosovo and has raised
expectations among many families that their men are coming home.
</P>
<P>
   But residents said many men who arrived home last week had
received orders to return on Sunday, and local television announced
that men of special units should report for duty at their local
command centers.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers immediately organized meetings, and many came in from
outlying villages to join the protests. A number of women made
speeches to the crowd gathered in Aleksandrovac on Sunday. Women
outnumbered the men in the crowd, but there were soldiers in
uniform and young men in civilian clothes, a resident of
Aleksandrovac said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are telling one story,'' he said of the soldiers. ``Their
lives are in danger down there. Planes are flying very low _ they
don't hit them much, they are targeting mostly armor and military
objects, but the men do not see the purpose of being there. They
feel like live targets, they feel that NATO can just cover them
with bombs any time it wants and they might die for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The resident said the soldiers who returned had said they no
longer felt as safe in Kosovo as they did earlier. ``This is not a
political protest,'' he said. ``It is simply people who are trying
to save their necks.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- James E. Dowd, former president of the Boston Stock
Exchange, died of cancer Sunday in the Lahey Clinic in Burlington.
He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dowd was president of the Boston Stock Exchange from 1969 to
1982. During his tenure he organized the New England Securities
Depository Trust Co., a subsidiary that offers a computerized book
entry system for members, and established BOSECO (for Boston Stock
Exchange Co.), which offers members access to the world's major
stock exchanges through associate member seats held by the Boston
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dowd, of Concord, was born in Cambridge. He interrupted his
studies at Boston College to serve in the Army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the Irish-looking face,'' as he said in a story
published in the Globe on Jan. 13, 1966, he became an interpreter
of Italian. He was then sent to the Pacific Theater ``to get the
best use of my training,'' he told the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Following the war, he graduated from Boston College and its law
school.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to becoming president of the Boston Stock Exchange, Mr.
Dowd was responsible for preventing abuses in the securities
industry as New England regional administrator of the Security
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that New Englanders have the reputation of
looking at both ends of a nickel before they spend it,'' he said in
1966, ``a lot of money has been taken out of New England
fraudulently.''
</P>
<P>
   After stepping down as president of the Boston Stock Exchange,
Mr. Dowd was a consultant to the American Stock Exchange and a
director of Federated Investors Inc., the Dresdner R.C.M. Europe
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Marguerite (O'Donoghue); a daughter, Anne E.
Goodhue of Concord; two sisters, Alice I. Dowd of Arlington and
Grace E. Shea of Hyde Park; and two granddaughters.

GORE TO ANNOUNCE POLICY CHANGE TO HELP IMPROVE HEALTH OF LEGAL
IMMIGRANTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore will announce Tuesday in
Texas a new Department of Justice regulation reassuring legal
immigrants that their application for some government benefits will
not affect their residency status.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, joined by President Clinton, will host the fifth annual
White House Community Empowerment Conference at the University of
Texas-Pan American at Edinburg to highlight the success of creating
jobs in hard-pressed areas such as South Texas. He also will raise
campaign money Wednesday in Dallas and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's office said the new regulation would clarify a
misconception that deterred some legal immigrants from applying for
Medicaid or a series of children's services, such as school lunch,
child care services and the new Children's Health Insurance
Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new regulation will improve the health of our families by
addressing widespread confusion that prevents legal immigrants from
signing up for health insurance, school lunch, child care and other
essential programs,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the new regulation may meet some opposition in
Congress, where some lawmakers believe it will send the wrong
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans believe that immigration policy should bring people
to our country who will work hard and contribute, but these rules
will increase the number of immigrants on welfare who will be able
to bring in more immigrants to go on welfare and are an insult to
all Americans _ native born and immigrant,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-San Antonio and a Republican pointman on immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, an unannounced candidate for president, also will make the
announcement in the heavily Hispanic area of South Texas. The
Hispanic vote is expected to be critical in the 2000 election
cycle, especially in states such as Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush's capture of more than 40 percent of
the Hispanic vote in his re-election campaign last year _ a record
high for a Republican in the state _ is one of the factors that has
made him the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statement said the 1996 immigration reform law and the
welfare reform law generated confusion among many legal immigrants
that an application for certain public benefits would deem them a
``public charge'' and subject them to deportation and denial of
permanent residency status.
</P>
<P>
   It cited a 1998 Urban Institute study that found a 21 percent
drop in Los Angeles County in the number of legal immigrants
applying for available programs between January 1996 and January
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Eligible legal immigrants can receive, without fear of
jeopardizing their immigration status, health insurance, which
includes Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program, access
to immunization, testing and treatment of communicable disease,
access to nutrition programs and other support programs, such as
child care services, housing assistance, energy assistance,
emergency disaster relief, foster care, adoption assistance,
transportation vouchers, educational assistance and job training
programs.
</P>
<P>

SCHOOLS MAY BE SUED OVER STUDENT-TO-STUDENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (EDs: ADDS 6 grafs of reaction after 8th graf starting Title IX
...)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ School systems around the country were put on
notice Monday that they must stop students from sexually harassing
their classmates or face the possibility of paying costly damages
to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that teachers and
school administrators who fail to stop student-to-student sexual
harassment may be violating a federal anti-bias law known as Title
IX.
</P>
<P>
   The court said a school district that accepts federal funding
can be held financially responsible for the sexual harassment of a
student if officials with the authority to help the child knew
about the harassment but were ``deliberately indifferent'' to it.
</P>
<P>
   In defining the harassment the court said it must be so
``severe, pervasive and objectively offensive'' that it prevents
the victim from learning or taking part in school activities.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' ruling was similar to a high court decision last
June that school districts can be held responsible when teachers
sexually harass students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recipients of federal funding may be liable for subjecting
their students to discrimination where the recipient is
deliberately indifferent to known acts of student-on-student sexual
harassment and the harasser is under the school's disciplinary
authority,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling reversed a 7-4 decision by 11th Circuit Court of
Appeals saying that Title IX never applies to student-on-student
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 bans sexual
discrimination in any educational institution that receives federal
money. The Supreme Court has long treated sexual harassment as a
form of illegal bias.
</P>
<P>
   The decision triggered sharply divided reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The National Education Association, representing more than 2.4
million teachers and school administrators, said the ruling will
help children attend school in an environment free of harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson here is that school districts should work to
prevent harassment from occurring in the first place through
education and training programs for students and staff,'' NEA
President Bob Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lisa Brown, who wrote a friend-of-the-court brief for the
National School Board Association, predicted the decision will lead
to more lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see teachers and administrators spending more
and more time in court and with their lawyers,'' she said, adding
that the ruling will also give courts more control over the
day-to-day running of classrooms. ``Federal courts will slowly but
surely begin to make guidelines that will have to be followed by
teachers and principals,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia D. Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law
Center, a Washington-based group promoting women's legal rights,
said, ``This ruling extends to students basic protections against
sexual harassment that prevents them from getting the education
they deserve and have a right to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's case centered around LaShonda Davis, who was a
fifth-grade student at Hubbard Elementary School in Forsyth, Ga.,
in the 1992-1993 school year.
</P>
<P>
   Over a five-month period, a classmate of LaShonda, known only as
G.F., made her life unbearable. Whenever the chance arose, he tried
to grab her breasts, rub against her in the hallway or say sexually
explicit remarks, such as he wanted ``get in bed'' with her. One
day, G.F., whose desk was next to LaShonda, put a doorstop in his
pants and gestured suggestively.
</P>
<P>
   LaShonda and her mother, Aurelia Davis, repeatedly told her
teacher about G.F.'s behavior. They were assured that the principal
had been informed and that something would be done to stop G.F. But
nothing was done, and G.F. continued to taunt and grope.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, LaShonda's mother went directly to the principal,
who said he would look into the matter. But again, nothing
happened.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Aurelia sued the Monroe County School Board in federal
court, claiming that teachers and school administrators had not
done enough to protect her child from sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, a U.S. District Court dismissed the Davis
lawsuit, saying, ``The sexually harassing behavior of a fellow
fifth-grader is not part of a school program or activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the 11th Circuit Court upheld that decision, ruling
that while Title IX authorizes suits for sexual harassment, its
coverage did not extend to harassment by one's peers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the appeals court's decision in the Davis case appeared
vulnerable after the Supreme Court's ruling last June. The high
court said then, also in a 5-4 decision, that monetary damages
could be granted if a school official who had authority to do
something about harassment of students by school employees ``has
actual notice of or is deliberately indifferent'' to the
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday O'Connor was joined in her opinion by Justices John
Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, Kennedy said, ``We can be assured that
like suits will follow _ suits, which in cost and number, will
impose serious financial burdens on local school districts, the
taxpayers who support them and the children they serve.''

JAMES E. DOWD, WAS PRESIDENT OF BOSTON STOCK EXCHANGE; 77

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- James E. Dowd, former president of the Boston Stock
Exchange, died of cancer Sunday in the Lahey Clinic in Burlington.
He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dowd was president of the Boston Stock Exchange from 1969 to
1982. During his tenure he organized the New England Securities
Depository Trust Co., a subsidiary that offers a computerized book
entry system for members, and established BOSECO (for Boston Stock
Exchange Co.), which offers members access to the world's major
stock exchanges through associate member seats held by the Boston
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dowd, of Concord, was born in Cambridge. He interrupted his
studies at Boston College to serve in the Army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the Irish-looking face,'' as he said in a story
published in the Globe on Jan. 13, 1966, he became an interpreter
of Italian. He was then sent to the Pacific Theater ``to get the
best use of my training,'' he told the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Following the war, he graduated from Boston College and its law
school.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to becoming president of the Boston Stock Exchange, Mr.
Dowd was responsible for preventing abuses in the securities
industry as New England regional administrator of the Security
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that New Englanders have the reputation of
looking at both ends of a nickel before they spend it,'' he said in
1966, ``a lot of money has been taken out of New England
fraudulently.''
</P>
<P>
   After stepping down as president of the Boston Stock Exchange,
Mr. Dowd was a consultant to the American Stock Exchange and a
director of Federated Investors Inc., the Dresdner R.C.M. Europe
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Marguerite (O'Donoghue); a daughter, Anne E.
Goodhue of Concord; two sisters, Alice I. Dowd of Arlington and
Grace E. Shea of Hyde Park; and two granddaughters.

 &HT;    Details of China's spying `frightening'
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An explosive 700-page congressional report
documenting China's efforts to obtain sensitive U.S. technology and
military secrets will be released today with an unusual stamp of
bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   The original mission of the special House investigatory
committee was to uncover possible campaign fund-raising and export
policy abuses by the Clinton admin- istration.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the nine-member panel headed by Rep. Christopher Cox
(R-Calif.) has uncovered an aggressive spy network that spans two
decades and both Democratic and Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an investigation of the Clinton administration,''
Cox said. ``This is an investigation of the espionage by the
People's Republic of China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The spying is pervasive and it is frightening to see how much
they stole,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox was appointed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.)
last summer to investigate whether Clinton had compromised national
security by approving export licenses for American satellite makers
who had given generously to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The report finds that Chinese officials used a variety of
approaches to acquire U.S. military technology including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Using 3,000 so-called ``front companies'' operated by Chinese
nationals living in the United States to obtain information on
commercial satellites and other sensitive technology made here.
</P>
<P>
   _ Illegally diverting ``dual use technology,'' technology with
both commercial and military capabilities to solely military
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Applying pressure on U.S. companies to share sensitive
technology in joint ventures such as commercial satellite launches
in China.
</P>
<P>
   _ Engaging military personnel to engage in spying at nuclear
laboratories throughout the country, including Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory and Los Alamos Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The report also finds that interagency conflicts among the
Justice Department, CIA and Energy Department led to delays in
probing espionage at the nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
   After briefing senators last week about the report's findings,
lawmakers suggested over the weekend that Attorney General Janet
Reno consider resigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Justice Department is adrift,'' said Sen.
Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee on CBS's ``Face the Nation'' on Sunday. ``I believe it's
time, considering her role or lack of role.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelby's committee recently released its own report on China's
efforts to obtain military secrets, alleging that lax monitoring of
satellite exports has enhanced Beijing's ability to develop highly
sophisticated missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.), a staunch supporter of the
administration, appeared to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something wrong when the United States Congress on a
bipartisan basis has so little confidence in the chief law
enforcement officer of the United States,'' said Torricelli,
appearing on the same television program.
</P>
<P>
   The White House supported Reno, saying it would be
``inappropriate to prejudge'' the attorney general before the
report is released.
</P>
<P>
   As for the allegations that valuable nuclear secrets have been
stolen, White House Spokesperson Joe Lockhart said Monday that the
administration is ``under no illusions'' about the spy operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do try to acquire technology that, for whatever reason,
they can't produce indigenously,'' Lockhart said. ``And that has
gone on . . . for 40 years and probably longer.''

COUNTDOWN BEGINS FOR SHUTTLE MISSION TO SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a lengthy hiatus in shuttle missions and a bleak stretch
for U.S. military and commercial rocket launches from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., NASA is poised to help lift the nation's space
program from the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Discovery and a crew of seven are to blast off at
6:48 a.m. EDT Thursday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. The
countdown for the 10-day mission to the unstaffed international
space station began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted a slight chance that fog would delay
liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   The flight will mark the first shuttle launch in nearly six
months. It comes on the heels of a disastrous several weeks for the
Lockheed Martin Titan 4 and Boeing Delta 3 unmanned rockets
launched from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station that adjoins
Kennedy. Last week, the situation prompted President Clinton to
order a sweeping probe of the seemingly unrelated incidents as the
losses surpassed $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency will forge ahead with Discovery's launching,
claiming it has staved off concerns that its shuttle work force has
grown rusty because of the unusually long hiatus in missions _ the
longest since the fatal 1986 Challenger accident suspended flights
for 32 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team definitely feels prepared,'' said NASA test director
Doug Lyons, who supervised Discovery's countdown activities Monday.
``We do have confidence in ourselves and the hardware.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent shuttle flight blasted off Dec. 4. Its crew
joined the first two components of the new station several days
later.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle flight rate has sunk to its lowest annual total
since 1989. No more than five shuttle sorties are planned for 1999,
the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the shuttle's role now is dedicated to assembly of the
U.S.-led international space station. The temporary decline in
flights is attributable primarily to a 19-month delay in Russia's
launching of the new outpost's habitable service module. The
module's launching is tentatively targeted for late November from
Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The service module's arrival at the new station should unleash a
flurry of shuttle missions with a backlog of U.S. station
components.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't noticed any rustiness, but it's something we need to
be cognizant of,'' said veteran astronaut Kent Rominger,
Discovery's commander.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's flight was delayed one week so that shuttle
technicians could repair damages caused to the shuttle's fuel tank
by a recent hail storm.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the training by the astronauts as well as by lead flight
director Wayne Hale's mission control teams in Houston and the
launch control teams at Kennedy involves the rehearsal of elaborate
flight plans with realistic ground simulations.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, the Air Force successfully launched a massive,
unmanned Titan 4 with a classified reconnaissance satellite from
Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. Though most details of the
mission are secret, it apparently broke the run of Titan mishaps
from Cape Canaveral that prompted the White House investigations.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those included losses April 9 and April 30 of Titan 4s with
Defense Support Program missile early warning and Milstar
communications satellites. The string of losses from Florida began
Aug. 12 with the explosion of a Titan 4 with another classified spy
satellites 40 seconds after lifting off from Cape Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, Boeing's new Delta 3 expendable rocket suffered its
second mishap with a commercial communications satellite after
lifting off from Cape Canaveral. The first Delta 3 mishap from the
Florida launch complex occurred last Aug. 26 as the rocket lifted
off with another commercial communications satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery pilot Rick Husband sees no link to the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of those are unmanned vehicles,'' he said. ``They are not
required to have the same level of safety as the manned vehicles
are supposed to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen talking to the folks at Kennedy and the
folks (at Johnson) they seem very professional in their approach
and very thorough in the preparations. I'm impressed in the pride
they take in their work,'' Husband said. ``This really hasn't
generated any additional concern for me or my family or friends.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's crew arrived late Sunday at Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Rominger and Husband, they include fight engineer
Ellen Ochoa, mission specialists Tammy Jernigan and Dan Barry,
Canadian astronaut Julie Payette and Russian cosmonaut Valery
Tokarev.
</P>
<P>
   After docking with the new station, the shuttle crew will
transfer nearly 2 tons of supplies for the first resident crew that
is slated to arrive early next year as well as to make repairs to
the power and satellite communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   Jernigan and Barry plan a spacewalk of almost seven hours during
which they will install U.S. and Russian made cargo cranes on the
outside of the outpost.

 (ATTN: Calif., La.)  
 COURT RULING KEEPS TWO AVENUES OPEN IN DISABILITY CASES  (jw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday examined two federal
laws aimed at protecting disabled workers and concluded that,
contrary to a lower court's view, there was no inevitable conflict
between them.
</P>
<P>
   One was the Social Security Act, which provides benefits to
people whose disabilities are so severe that they cannot ``engage
in any substantial gainful activity'' for at least 12 months. The
other was the Americans With Disabilities Act, which protects
workers with disabilities from discrimination as long as they can
perform the job's essential functions, with ``reasonable
accommodation'' if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Some lower courts have ruled that because someone who has
applied for or received Social Security disability benefits is by
definition unfit for employment, such a person is either barred
from suing for disability discrimination or faces special judicial
hurdles in pursuing a disability lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous opinion Monday by Justice Stephen Breyer, the
court disagreed. The two laws appear ``divergent,'' Breyer said,
but in context, they ``do not inherently conflict'' and ``can
comfortably exist side by side.'' He said the Social Security
program, receiving more than 2.5 million claims for benefits every
year, necessarily made broad determinations without a fine-tuned
examination of an individual's situation _ for example, whether
employees who cannot work without accommodations can return to work
if their special needs are addressed.
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a grant of summary judgment won by a
company that had dismissed a woman who tried to come back to work
after a stroke. The employer would not give her the extra time and
special training she said she needed. She applied for and received
Social Security benefits, at the same time suing the employer for
failing to accommodate her under the Americans With Disabilities
Act.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling for the employer, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in New Orleans held that the application for or receipt of
Social Security disability benefits had created the presumption
that a worker was not entitled to bring a discrimination suit
against the employer. Only in ``some limited and highly unusual set
of circumstances'' could the two laws not be seen as ``mutually
exclusive,'' the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion Monday, Cleveland vs. Policy Management Systems
Corp., No. 97-1008, Breyer said it was common in the legal system
for people to pursue two alternative theories at once. When there
is an apparent inconsistency in the disability context, he said,
courts should not erect special burdens but should simply require
the plaintiff to explain the inconsistencies.
</P>
<P>
   He indicated that the explanation could be as simple as a
medical condition that had changed over time. The case now goes
back to the lower courts to give the plaintiff, Carolyn Cleveland,
a second chance at her discrimination suit.
</P>
<P>
   Beatrice Dohrn, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund,
a gay rights organization that filed a brief in the case, said the
decision could be particularly beneficial to people with the virus
that causes AIDS. With drug therapy, she said, people with HIV
often ``move in and out of being able to work'' and often face
discrimination on the job when they do work. The decision ``broke
down a barrier that people with HIV needed to get past,'' Ms. Dohrn
said.
</P>
<P>
   The court's other rulings Monday included these:
</P>
<P>
   --Nonprofits. The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction to
prevent certain nonprofit organizations, in this case a state
dental association, from engaging in unfair competition or
deceptive practices, the court ruled unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission Act, which dates to 1914, gives the
commission authority over the business practices of ``persons,
partnerships or corporations,'' with a corporation defined as an
organization ``which is organized to carry on business for its own
profit or that of its members.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the trade commission found that the 19,000-member
California association unreasonably restricted trade by placing
strict limits on the types of advertising dentists could use. The
nonprofit association challenged both the commission's jurisdiction
and its findings, both of which were upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion by Justice David Souter, the Supreme Court agreed
Monday on the jurisdictional question. Souter said it was
sufficient that members received economic benefits from the
association, such as favorable insurance rates as well as lobbying,
public relations, and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   But, Souter said, the Court of Appeals made too cursory an
analysis of the advertising restrictions before concluding that
they had an anti-competitive effect. The case, California Dental
Association vs. FTC, No. 97-1625, was sent back to the appeals
court for a new, more searching analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on that section of the opinion was 5-4. Breyer, joined
by Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, said the Court of Appeals properly found that the
restrictions on advertising prices and quality claims had deprived
consumers of useful information.
</P>
<P>
   --Property rights. The court ruled 5-4 that a property owner
suing a local government for depriving him of his right to develop
his property was entitled to have the case tried by a jury rather
than solely by a judge.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, City of Monterey vs. Del Monte Dunes, No. 97-1235,
affirmed a ruling by the 9th Circuit and was a victory for
developers, who view juries as more sympathetic than judges in this
type of case. The developer in this case spent years trying to get
permission to build houses on 37 acres of ocean-front property in
California, eventually winning a $1.45 million award from a jury on
the claim that the protracted proceedings violated its
constitutional right to due process.

 &HT;    Supreme Court says school systems responsible for sexual
harassment complaints
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ School systems can be held liable and ordered to pay
damages to victims if educators ignore student complaints of sexual
harassment by classmates, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling drew mixed reactions from school officials and
lawyers who represent school systems. Some said similar policies
are in place or being drafted anyway, while others predicted
schools would act without trying to distinguish between harassment
and teasing.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision, the court sided with Aurelia Davis, a
Forsyth, Ga. woman who sued the Monroe County Board of Education,
claiming school officials did nothing to stop repeated sexual
harassment of her fifth-grade daugher by a male student at the
elemantary school they attended.
</P>
<P>
   The high court said parents such as Davis can sue a school board
under a federal law known as Title IX, which bans sexual
discrimination in any educational institution that receives federal
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited because this ruling is not just for me, it's
for parents of all schoolchildren,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling will require school boards to adopt sexual harassment
policies for students and make them known to teachers and students,
said Davis' lawyer, Verna Williams of the National Women's Law
Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although Monroe County allegedly had no such policy in 1992,
policies against students sexually harrassing other students are
becoming commonplace, if not universal. Large school districts in
the metro area, for example, all point to existing policies
prohibiting student-on-student harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling is so important, because the Supreme Court is
saying that schools can't turn their backs on student-to-student
sexual harassment. Up until today, that was an open question. Now
it's the law,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for a national group of school administrators
worried that the ruling will result in schools trying to protect
themselves by imposing harsher discipline for seemingly minor
incidents, such as last year's suspension of a first-grader in
North Carolina who kissed another student.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to hope the court has not taken flexibility out of
the hands of the officials who have to enforce discipline in our
schools,'' said Bruce Hunter of the American Association of School
Administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, sought to
limit the scope of the decision, saying school districts can be
found liable only if educators knew about a student being sexually
harassed and did nothing. The legal standard of ``deliberate
indifference'' is a high threshold for plaintiffs to clear, but it
is the same standard the court adopted last year when it ruled in a
Texas case that school districts can be held liable when teachers
sexually harass students.
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling, O'Connor also said the alleged sexual harassment
must be so severe and so pervasive that it impedes a student's
ability to learn. ``Damages are not available for simple acts of
teasing and name-calling among school children...even where these
comments target differences in gender,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, this is not saying that kids can't be kids, she
said, directing courts to keep in mind that schools are unlike the
adult workplace and that ``children may regularly interact in a
manner that would be unacceptable among adults.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a scathing dissent, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the
decision inflicts the federal government on the nation's school
rooms and imposes ``potential crushing financial liability'' on
school districts already overwhelmed by violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be assured that like suits will follow _ suits, which
in cost and number, will impose serious financial burdens on local
school districts, the taxpayers who support them and the children
they serve,'' Kennedy wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also criticized the majority for failing to give more
precise direction to school districts about what type of limits can
be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After today, Johnny will find that the routine problems of
adolescence are to be resolved by invoking a federal right to
demand assignment to a desk two rows away,'' wrote Kennedy, who
took the unusual step of reading at length from his dissenting
opinion in open court.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor responded in court by saying concern for ``little
Johnny'' should not drive ``little Mary'' from the classroom in
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Underwood, general counsel for the National School Boards
Association, sought to downplay the ruling's significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it means thousands of lawsuits will be filed,''
she said. ``School boards can be held liable only if they actually
knew and did nothing. I think that's going to be a rare occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Allbritten, Georgia Association of Educators director,
expressed concern over the time and money schools might have to
spend defending against frivolous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there wil be a rash (of suits) for awhile,''
Allbritton said. ``Then, once common sense prevails, it'll be
something that's just intergrated in an appropriate way into
character education and student codes of conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Georgia, he said, any weaknesses in current
policies will be addressed by a student discipline law recently
signed by Gov. Roy Barnes. It requires all180 systems to have a
code of conduct, reflecting community viewpoints, and requires
character education, or moral lessons, at every grade.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Hartley, a Gainesville, Ga.-based attorney whose firm has
represented more than 100 Georgia school systems, said he believes
districts are doing exactly what they should be doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For quite some time, school systems have been aware of the
issue,'' Hartley said. ``Frankly, I don't know of anything more, on
a day-to-day basis, school systems really could do.''
</P>
<P>
   But he worried that the ruling will encourage unwinnable
lawsuits against schools, costing taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very simple to make an allegation in a lawsuit that
would meet these standards,'' he said. ``From the time (parents)
file a lawsuit to the time you can prove enough to get the judge to
throw it out can cost the school system a great deal of money.''
Atlanta and the large county systems in Fulton, Cobb, Gwinnett and
DeKalb all have policies against sexual harrassment by students. In
Atlanta, for example, an offense can be an off-color joke or
unwelcome touching of a body part; it can be a pattern of behavior
or one serious act. Students can charge other students anonymously,
but are subject to discipline for intentional false reports.
Punishment ranges from counseling to expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've started viewing any kind of harassment as bullying,''
said Garry McGiboney, who oversees student security and discipline
in DeKalb County. ``We handle it under the violence section that
deals with making verbal threats.''

Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

RESEARCHERS DECRY LEAK OF CELL PHONE DATA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists studying links between cellular telephone use and
cancer are furious that preliminary data were leaked from their
research in a way that, they say, falsely suggested that the phones
may be linked to brain tumors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, investigators said Monday, the data show no clear link.
Several people close to the situation said the consultant who
released the information may have been trying to stir up fears to
get millions of dollars more for himself or for associates to
continue research.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant, a George Washington faculty member, George
Carlo, denied that he is looking for more business.
</P>
<P>
   For years, studies have overwhelmingly disputed a cancer risk
from the low-level electromagnetic energy of cell phones. But with
70 million to 100 million Americans now using cell phones, any hint
of danger attracts intense political and scientific interest.
</P>
<P>
   A story distributed Friday by The Washington Post, and which was
published in Saturday's Globe under the headline ``Study suggests
cell phones tied to cancer,'' cited ``possible connections''
between cell-phone use and cancer. It used a statistical study
examining rates of a rare brain cancer called neurocytoma, as well
as a laboratory study.
</P>
<P>
   The work was overseen by a Washington consulting firm, Wireless
Technology Research LLC, under a six-year, $27 million contract
expiring next month that was funded by a blind trust established by
cellular industry companies. The trust arrangement was aimed at
enhancing the studies' credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The consulting firm, chaired by Carlo, a lawyer and
public-health specialist on the George Washington University
faculty, hired scientists led by Dr. Joshua Muscat, a widely
published New York epidemiologist, for a ``case-control'' study.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, Muscat's group has compared 450 people
with brain cancer to a control group of 450 others. Carlo said in
an interview Monday that Muscat's findings suggest a nearly tripled
risk of a brain cancer called neurocytoma among cell-phone users.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is a gray area,'' Carlo said. ``No one _
myself included _ believes that these findings rise to the level of
a public health threat, but clearly there is a need for timely,
follow-on research.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the investigators working with Muscat, Dr. Michael
Huncharek, director of Meta-Analysis Research Group in Columbia,
S.C. and a radiology professor at the University of South Carolina
Medical Center, said: ``There is no more study needed on this
issue. There really was no association found between cell phone use
and the development of primary brain tumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Huncharek, a Boston University Medical School graduate who
trained at Massachusetts General Hospital, said: ``This is grossly
irresponsible to release something like this. It's going to hit the
industry hard, it's going to scare people, and in academia, doing
something like this would get you fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Muscat, the principal investigator, who is with the American
Health Foundation in New York, said, ``The results that are quoted
by other sources really don't have much credence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not appropriate'' for any data to be publicized yet,
Muscat said, especially not an ``isolated finding that's taken out
of context.'' And he voiced fear that the early publicity would
ruin chances of publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal for
the study, which is still a month from completion.
</P>
<P>
   The indication of increased neurocytoma from cell-phone usage,
investigators said, hinges on a single New York University
neuropathologist whose diagnoses many other physicians dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Others theorize that those cases were in fact a far more common
kind of brain cancer called astrocytoma, Huncharek said. Muscat
said only that ``there's ambiguity'' about the diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   If those cases are in fact the more common astrocytoma, the data
would show no statistically significant increased risk of brain
tumors among cell-phone users, said Huncharek, who voiced outraged
that Carlo had released the data.
</P>
<P>
   Carlo himself acknowledged that despite showing an apparently
elevated risk of neurocytoma among cell-phone users, Muscat's
results also show the opposite of a ``dose-response'' effect: Rates
of brain cancer were lower among people who spent more time on a
cell phone, rather than higher.
</P>
<P>
   However, Carlo opposed reconsidering or reclassifying the New
York cases as astrocytoma, saying that would be ``retrofitting the
data and would invalidate the study.'' He said he welcomes later
scrutiny of the New York results. Some investigators say this step
should be taken before publication, not afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Three Capitol Hill sources involved in the issue, who asked not
to be named, said there might be other motivations. One of them
said: ``Part of what might be going on here is Carlo looking for an
extension on his research contract.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carlo said that when his term as chairman of the group
expires next month, ``I'm not going to re-up. The future'' of
Wireless Technology Research ``is unclear. . . . When we complete
our job, that's going to be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association officials would
not comment directly, but in veiled criticism of Carlo's early
release of data, the association president, Thomas Wheeler, said
the association ``welcomes independent, peer-reviewed scientific
inquiry, and will continue to support independent, peer-reviewed
work where appropriate and necessary,'' ideally under the aegis of
the US Food and Drug Administration.

PATAKI MOVE VIEWED AS AIMED AT GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Anticlimax, thy name is George Pataki!''
</P>
<P>
   So said Maurice Carroll, head of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute after Governor Pataki announced he was endorsing Governor
George W. Bush of Texas for president.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki had lit a fuse a week ago, alerting reporters that, come
Monday (May 24), he would make ``a major political announcement.''
Rumors flew that he would run for US Senate or even the presidency
_ rumors that he and his aides did nothing to dispel.
</P>
<P>
   He rented a ballroom in a midtown hotel and invited a few dozen
of the state's major Republicans to join him on the dais. At least
that many reporters and 24 TV cameras showed up to record the
event. Cheers rang out as he approached the podium.
</P>
<P>
   And then, at 10 a.m., Pataki became the 16th governor in the
land to throw his support behind the as-yet-unannounced candidacy
of his old pal, whom he has known since their college days at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's face beamed from a huge closed-circuit television screen,
thanking him and proclaiming, ``I intend to win New York.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked about a possible Senate race, Pataki
replied, ``You never say never, but . . . I have no intention of
running for the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The sighs of relief from City Hall could almost be heard all the
way uptown.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has been thinking about running for
the Senate seat that Daniel Patrick Moynihan is vacating in 2000.
Had Pataki thrown his hat in that ring, it would have knocked the
mayor out before the match began. There's no way, most political
observers believe, the mayor could beat the governor in a statewide
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the governor and the mayor _ both Republicans
_ have never been warm and rarely been frostier. The widespread
suspicion is that he let the other rumors fly precisely to tweak
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the general consensus,'' Cristyne Lategano, Giuliani's
communications director, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she thought Pataki had in mind by hinting last week
at grander plans, Lategano replied, ``I wouldn't even begin to
analyze the governor's action. That's for someone with a different
degree than mine. But it was quite fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   Even one of Pataki's close friends, who asked not to be
identified, said the governor should not have hyped the event. ``I
think it was a mistake,'' the friend said. ``It set up too-high
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, political analysts from both parties agree, if Pataki
meant to take a swat at the mayor, the announcement _ however
anticlimactic _ succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was Pataki letting Rudy Giuliani know who the big guy is
in the state's Republican Party,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a
Democratic consultant. ``He showed he can deliver every Republican
politician in the state, and Rudy can't. That was the whole deal.
Rather shallow, but that's what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki did let Giuliani off one hook, however. Some analysts had
wondered if the governor might use the occasion to endorse yet
another candidate for the Senate seat. Representative Rick Lazio, a
Republican from Long Island, has expressed interest in running, and
Pataki has reportedly encouraged him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday if he would endorse Giuliani for the Senate, Pataki
replied, ``Certainly I would consider endorsing him,'' and added
that he ``will endorse'' the party's candidate, whoever it is.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki saved his big punch for the most-talked-about Democratic
contender, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, saying, to loud
cheers and laughter, ``We don't need anyone coming here from
Washington to represent New York State.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was in New York again Monday, for the third time in
as many weeks. She attended several events, including a fund-raiser
for Representative Nita Lowey, a Democrat from Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Lowey has said she will run for Senate if Mrs. Clinton decides
against the race. (She gave no hint of her intentions Monday,
though she did reconfirm that she would make her post-White House
home in New York, regardless.)
</P>
<P>
   The first lady came into the city with the latest polls sending
mixed signals about her prospects. A Quinnipiac College poll of
registered voters, released Monday, showed her leading Giuliani,
48-42. On Sunday, a poll of likely voters, by the rival Zogby
International survey firm, showed the opposite _ Giuliani leading
Mrs. Clinton, 49-44.
</P>
<P>
   Both polls had a 3.5 percent margin of error, meaning that
neither can be read as indicating who is ahead or behind. What is
clear is that a New York Senate race starring this cast of
characters would start in a statistical dead heat.

THERMO ELECTRON DETAILS RESTRUCTURING MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thermo Electron Corp., the equipment and instruments maker, said
Monday it plans to further reduce the number of its publicly traded
subsidiaries and make other restructuring moves to shore up its
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it will take a $450 million pretax charge and
put up for sale business units with annual sales of $350 million.
The sales are expected to generate about $200 million in cash for
share buybacks or other investments, the company added.
</P>
<P>
   An unspecified number of jobs will also be cut as Thermo
Electron reduces the number of publicly traded subsidiaries to 11
from 23.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it expects the changes to improve results by
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Thermo Electron was once seen as a technology incubator, known
for its unusual strategy of spinning out subsidiaries into publicly
traded companies while retaining majority control. But lately, the
company's profitability and share price have sagged amid growing
Wall Street concerns that its spinout strategy may have gone too
far.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently tapped a new chief executive, Richard F.
Syron, to lead a turnaround, succeeding founder and longtime CEO
George Hatsopoulos.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Thermo Electron said it would cut the number of its
public subsidiaries to 15.
</P>
<P>
   The Waltham, Mass. company's stock sagged as low as 12 11/16 on
April 15. Before the announcement Monday, it fell 1/4 to close at
$19 3/8 a share, less than half of the level of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a large shareholder, Franklin Mutual
Advisors, criticized Thermo Electron management and began to press
the company to step up a share repurchase program and to shed
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Syron, who will become Thermo Electron's chief executive on June
1, said Monday that the latest changes were ``in the spirit of what
Franklin was raising questions about.'' But he said the changes
were already contemplated before Franklin's criticized the company.
Thermo Electron hasn't decided whether it will repurchase more
shares, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Syron said, Thermo Electron will be able to concentrate on
its most profitable operations. ``There's a variety of motivations
for doing this, like some units that have insufficient returns,''
Syron said. ``Others detract from our focus on operating
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   With partial ownership in businesses ranging from surgical eye
lasers to paper-recycling equipment to clean fuels, Thermo Electron
has operated as a confederation of units with a total revenue of
$3.9 billion among two dozen companies and 26,000 employees
worldwide, including 3,627 in Massachusetts and about 2,000 more in
the rest of New England.
</P>
<P>
   The original spinout strategy was meant to provide funding for
managers who wanted to start up their own ventures. But many became
esoteric and less profitable. ``It worked up to a point, but they
pushed it to an excess,'' said Goldman Sachs analyst Deane Dray.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Thermo Electron said it will absorb four of its public
subsidiaries _ ThermoLase Corp., ThermoTrex Corp., Thermo Ecotek
Corp. and Thermo Vision Corp. _ by exchanging shares or cash for
all outstanding stock of the four companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Thermo Electron said it will take about $450
million in charges for the second quarter ended July 3. The charges
include: $125 million for the planned sale of clean-fuel facilities
at Thermo Ecotek; $105 million for restructuring of ThermoLase
Corp. and Trex Medical Corp.; and $65 million for the sale of oil
recycling facilities and other actions by Thermo TerraTech Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For its second quarter a year ago, Thermo Electron reported net
income of $61.79 million on sales of $947.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and observers greeted news of the latest changes with
cautious optimism. Among them was perhaps the company's most vocal
critic, Peter Langerman, chief executive of Franklin Mutual in
Short Hills, N.J., who said Monday's announcement was ``consistent
with what one would expect'' from the company. Michael Hutchison,
senior analyst at Barrington Research Associates in Chicago, said
he approved of the plans at first glance. ``Although $450 million
sounds like a big number, and it is, I think this is in the best
interests of the company,'' he said. ``All of these businesses
they're divesting very likely will have a positive impact on their
earnings, because they're only marginally profitable or are losing
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Thermo Electron also named to its board
of directors Samuel Bodman, chairman and chief executive of Cabot
Corp.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York Gov. George Pataki jumped on the George W.
Bush bandwagon Monday, joining a growing list of Republicans who
want the Texas governor to be their party's next presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside his own White House ambitions, Pataki hailed Bush
as a candidate who can expand the Republican base by drawing more
votes from women and minorities. Bush welcomed the high-profile
endorsement in a live satellite hookup to Pataki's New York news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's blessing is the latest in a steady stream of
endorsements that have helped make Bush the clear front-runner for
the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not made a single campaign trip or even declared
his candidacy, Bush has collected expressions of support from 16 of
the nation's 31 Republican governors, 8 of the 55 Republican
senators and 99 of the 222 Republican House members.
</P>
<P>
   Delegations of state legislators from at least 21 states,
including more than half of the Republicans in the California
Assembly, have also urged Bush to seek the nomination. Bush
campaign aides have scheduled daily endorsement announcements every
day for at least the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It's an impressive lineup, but political experts say the value
of endorsements varies widely.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some instances, it could be real _ real money and real
organizational support. In other cases, it's just another headline
that scares the opposition,'' New York pollster John Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush's opponents are scared by his backers, they don't let it
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell whether it makes a difference,'' said Ari
Fleischer, a spokesman for GOP hopeful Elizabeth Dole. ``The
establishment wants to close ranks behind one candidate. They all
like Elizabeth Dole, but they've decided to rally around one
candidate, and that candidate is George W. Bush. After Elizabeth
Dole becomes the nominee, she's going to welcome them all back into
the fold.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fleischer also acknowledged that the Republican governors
could be vital allies for Bush because of their home-state
connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these governors have winning organizations in their
states,'' said John Truscott, a spokesman for Michigan Gov. John
Engler, an early Bush backer. ``They are governors who know how to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Engler, a possible Republican vice presidential candidate,
called on 30 of his wealthy supporters help Bush raise more than
$392,000 in Michigan in the first three months of this year. The
total made the state Bush's third biggest source of donations,
behind Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   In another testament to Engler's clout, Detroit beat out Los
Angeles on the city ranking of donations, according to the Center
for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan organization that monitors
political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Truscott said Engler and his allies have nearly doubled the haul
for Bush in the second quarter of the year, which ends on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Engler has done a lot of phone calls and personal
visits,'' Truscott said. ``Over the years, he's put together a
great team that's extremely loyal to him. So when he asks for the
help, they line up quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers say Pataki may be able to do the same thing with his
Wall Street connections. The New York governor was joined at his
news conference by former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, another prodigious
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pataki is tight with Wall Street, and that's where the money
is. He and D'Amato can raise unlimited dollars, and I mean almost
unlimited,'' Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Spitzer, a political science professor at the State
University of New York in Cortland, said Bush's endorsements also
help foster the impression that the Texan's campaign is ``a train
rolling downhill at ever greater speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed to catch that spirit as he welcomed Pataki aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to count on you in the state of New York,'' he said,
dropping any pretense that he is merely exploring the possibility
of a campaign. ``You understand New York politics as well as
anybody. You've proven you can win, and I intend to win New York.''

 DIVIDED SUPREME COURT HOLDS SCHOOLS LIABLE FOR SEX HARASSMENT BY
STUDENTS  (rm) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ School districts can be liable for damages under
federal law for failing to stop a student from subjecting another
student to severe and pervasive sexual harassment, the Supreme
Court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-to-4 decision, with a majority opinion by Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor, found the court bitterly divided over the role of
federal law in the public school classroom. The ruling opened
school districts to liability for sexual harassment by students on
essentially the same grounds that a Supreme Court decision a year
ago set for liability when teachers harass students.
</P>
<P>
   What O'Connor, the author of both decisions, described Monday as
a statutory weapon against sex discrimination so severe that it
impairs a victim's ability to learn was labeled in Justice Anthony
M. Kennedy's dissenting opinion as an unwarranted federal intrusion
into ``day-to-day classroom logistics and interactions,'' a
judicial overreaction to ``the routine problems of adolescence.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens,
David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. Chief
Justice William Rehnquist joined Kennedy's dissent, along with
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually direct rejoinder from the bench, O'Connor
concluded her announcement of the decision by addressing the
dissenters who, she said, maintained that the ruling would ``teach
little Johnny a perverse lesson in federalism.'' Rather, she said,
the majority believed the decision ``assures that little Mary may
attend class.''
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion, O'Connor emphasized that ``damages are not
available for simple acts of teasing and name-calling among school
children'' but rather for behavior ``so severe, pervasive, and
objectively offensive that it denies its victims the equal access
to education'' guaranteed under Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972. School officials must have known of the
harassment and, acting with ``deliberate indifference,'' failed to
take reasonable steps to stop it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving a dispute among the lower federal courts, the decision
overturned a ruling last year by the federal appeals court in
Atlanta that Title IX, which bars sex discrimination in schools and
colleges that receive federal money, simply did not apply to
student-on-student harassment. The case will now go back to the
appeals court for an application of the test the court set Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The case was brought by the mother of a girl who, as a
fifth-grader in Forsyth, Ga., complained that she was subjected to
months of sexual advances, taunting and unwanted touching of her
breasts and genital area by a boy who was eventually charged and
convicted in juvenile court of sexual battery against her. The girl
said, among other complaints, that the boy put a door stop in his
pants and acted in a sexually suggestive manner toward her in a gym
class.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and school administrators refused to respond to
complaints brought by the mother, Aurelia Davis, and by her
daughter, LaShonda, who sat next the boy in class and kept begging
to have her seat changed. Unable to concentrate in school,
LaShonda's grades dropped and she wrote a suicide note. The suit
seeks $500,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   While the court did not reach a conclusion on the Monroe County
Board of Education's liability, O'Connor's graphic recitation of
the details of the harassing behavior made clear that the school
district does not face an easy task in the next phase of the case.
O'Connor emphasized that schools exercise significant control over
student discipline, particularly in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly, in light of the vehemence of Kennedy's
dissent, the National School Boards Association was supportive of
the decision. ``The standard has been set so high that it's a
standard we can live with and in fact are living up to already,''
Julie Underwood, the association's general counsel, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the situation the court was addressing was, in a
sense, ``anachronistic'' because in the six years since this
lawsuit was filed, ``school districts have really worked hard to
have policies against sexual harassment and to help children
understand sexual harassment.'' Monroe County had no formal policy
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law
Center, which represented the Davis family, said she was satisfied
with the decision as well. She said the court had drawn ``a line
that makes sense,'' adding that the decision ``puts
student-on-student harassment on a proper footing with the rest of
Title IX.''

HIGH COURT RULING CURBS JOURNALISTS' WITNESSING POLICE ACTIVITY IN
HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday that the
police violate ``the right of residential privacy at the core of
the Fourth Amendment'' when they take journalists and photographers
into people's homes to witness searches or arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The decision sharply curbs the popular, but increasingly
disputed, practice in which journalists accompany the police into
private homes and get dramatic coverage of law enforcement in
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely the possibility of good public relations for the police
is simply not enough, standing alone, to justify the ride-along
intrusion into a private home,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquist
wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling does not apply to situations in which journalists
ride along with police to report on activity in a public place,
such as a street-corner drug raid. Its application to private
property that is not actually inside a residence is not clear. The
court did not address the liability of news organizations
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled in two cases, one in which a joint federal and
local law enforcement task force invited the Washington Post to
send a reporter and photographer along on an operation to arrest
fugitives in the Washington area, and one in which federal wildlife
agents brought a CNN camera crew along on a search of a Montana
ranch. In both cases, the homeowners sued on the ground that the
media presence violated their Fourth Amendment rights against
unreasonable searches.
</P>
<P>
   None of the law enforcement officers involved in either case
will face personal liability. The court found they were entitled to
immunity because it was not clear at the time _ 1992 for the
incident in Rockville, Md., and 1993 for the Montana search _ that
the actions were unconstitutional. Under the court's doctrine of
``qualified immunity,'' public officials are not liable for
constitutional violations unless the right at issue was ``clearly
established'' at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitutional question presented by this case is by no
means open and shut'' and had not been ruled on by any court at the
time, Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens dissented from the immunity portion of
the ruling, saying that the court was not announcing a new rule but
simply ``refused to recognize an entirely unprecedented request for
an exception to a well-established principle'' that police cannot
bring outsiders into a private home to witness the execution of a
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens observed that the unusual fact that all nine justices
were in agreement on the underlying Fourth Amendment question
``certainly lends support to the notion that the question is indeed
`open and shut.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Washington-area case, Wilson vs. Layne, No. 98-83, the
police and their journalist companions arrived at the wrong
address; the home was not that of the fugitive, but of his parents,
who were roused from their sleep to find, in addition to the
officers, a photographer taking pictures and a reporter taking
notes. The Washington Post never published an article about the
incident, and was not sued by the parents, who were represented by
the local affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Its director, Arthur Spitzer, said Monday that as a result of
the ruling, ``law enforcement agents should now have no doubt that
their conduct is governed by the Bill of Rights and not by the
demands of infotainment.'' His clients are also suing the
government under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which does not
contain an immunity defense.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond,
Va., had dismissed the suit on immunity grounds without deciding
the Fourth Amendment question.
</P>
<P>
   In the Montana case, Hanlon vs. Berger, No. 97-1927, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, rejected
the agents' immunity claim and found the search violated the ranch
owners' Fourth Amendment rights. In addition, the appeals court
found that CNN, which was also a defendant, had through its joint
participation become a ``government actor'' and shared the agents'
liability.
</P>
<P>
   The justices never acted on the network's appeal of that ruling,
CNN vs. Berger, No. 97-1914, which remains pending before the
court. There are a number of factual issues about the nature of the
search to be resolved in the Montana case, so the court is not
likely to examine CNN's liability before the Ninth Circuit has a
chance to reconsider the whole case in light of Monday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   New organizations said that the decision would not have a direct
effect on their work because the earlier rulings had already caused
them to adjust their procedures. However, John Langley, executive
producer of a Fox network program, ``Cops,'' said his program would
continue as a ``pure ride-along show'' next season as it has since
1989. He said the program had always received releases from anyone
shown on camera, even people under arrest. ``Most of what we show
happens on the street or in cars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion in the Washington area case, Rehnquist noted that
the police had defended the ride-along practice as assisting law
enforcement in various ways. ``Were such `law enforcement
objectives' themselves sufficient to trump the Fourth Amendment,''
he said, ``the protections guaranteed by that amendment's text
would be significantly watered down.'' He said that outsiders could
join the police for specific purposes, giving the example of
property owners who come to identify stolen property.

 &HT;    Gore makes call for faith-based solutions in violent society
 &HT;    (EDS: MOVING IN (W) Washington and (A) General news categories.)
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vice President Al Gore came to Atlanta on Monday and
proposed that the government subsidize religious organizations so
that ``the unique power of faith'' can combat social ills.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking at an adult rehabilitation center run by the
Salvation Army, embraced an idea first offered by Republicans as he
called for ``a new partnership'' between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith- and value-based organizations'' already have shown ``a
muscular commitment'' to facing the nation's social problems, Gore
said, and a partnership with government would allow them to have an
even greater impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen the difference faith-based organizations make,''
Gore said, citing the experiences of his wife, Tipper, in working
with the homeless at Christ Church in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the lesson to the nation is clear: In those
instances where the unique power of faith can help us meet the
crushing social challenges that are otherwise impossible to meet
... we should explore carefully tailored partnerships with our
faith community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, the vice president went to Conyers, where he
met privately for more than 45 minutes at Rockdale Baptist Church
with the families of students who were wounded in last week's
shootings at Heritage High School.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight at the meeting, and media were kept at a
distance.
</P>
<P>
   At the rehab center earlier, Gore was introduced by Bradford
Culpepper, a resident of the rehabilitation center who marveled
that he had the opportunity to stand on the same platform with the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also shared the podium with Atlanta firefighter Matt
Mosely, whose daring rescue of a man trapped on a burning crane
mesmerized viewers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposed expanding the so-called ``Charitable Choice''
provision of the 1996 welfare overhaul law that allows states to
enlist ``faith-based'' organizations to provide basic services to
help move people from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must dare to embrace faith-based approaches that advance
our shared goals as Americans,'' he said. To do so would usher in
``a new era of civil society collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a former divinity student at Vanderbilt University, said
that approach should also be used for other social services, such
as drug treatment, homelessness and the prevention of youth
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that some civil liberties experts object that such
support could breach the constitutional wall between church and
state, Gore said there should be ``clear and strict safeguards''
against the government promoting a particular religious view.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president made a veiled reference to former President
Bush's emphasis on volunteerism, rather than expanded government
programs, in addressing social ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some past national political leaders have asked us to rely on
a fragile patchwork of well-intentioned volunteerism to feed the
hungry and house the homeless,'' he said. ``That approach,
optimistic though it was, was not adequate for the problems too
many Americans face. It left too many American children behind to
suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   From Conyers, Gore returned to Atlanta for a reception and
private dinner that were expected to net about $350,000 for his
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Gore's
address, which his campaign promoted as a major statement on
values, came as the vice president began a three-day campaign swing
through the South.
</P>
<P>
   Gore struck similar themes earlier in the day in Orlando at a
luncheon that netted his presidential campaign an estimated
$250,000. The vice president was flying late Monday night to Texas,
where he plans two more days of events.
</P>
<P>
   His press office said Gore planned today to announce a
regulation reassuring families that enrolling for government
benefits would not affect their immigration status.

RESCUERS RUSH TO FREE RIGHT WHALE   OFF NANTUCKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An animal rescue crew was recalled from training exercises in
South Carolina Monday to attempt a daring open sea disentanglement
of a rare Northern right whale that has become dangerously snarled
in fishing gear.
</P>
<P>
   The whale, swimming 60 miles off Nantucket, Mass., where gale
warnings and up to 12-foot seas were reported, has three buoys
floating near its head, and fishing line around its body and
trailing behind. Already, Charles ``Stormy'' Mayo of the Center for
Coastal Studies has placed a satellite tracking device on the
animal to allow rescuers to monitor its movement.
</P>
<P>
   But rough seas and fog prevented Mayo and his crew from
attempting to free the animal Monday, and National Marine Fisheries
Studies officials said the weather may prevent a rescue again
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we might have said this type of event isn't our
highest priority,'' said Center for Coastal Studies spokesman Scott
Landry, noting that the whale seems to be feeding normally. ``But
we've learned that even the most innocuous entanglement can turn
into something pretty grotesque pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry said the main concern is that fishing lines around the
45-foot-long whale's middle will grow tighter as the whale fattens
up at its summer feeding ground in the Bay of Fundy off Nova
Scotia. That, in turn, could interfere with feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Since there are only about 300 Northern right whales left in the
world, Landry said his Provincetown, Mass.-based organization did
not want to take a risk. Instead, two center officials who normally
work with Mayo on whale rescues were called back from South
Carolina where they were training others.
</P>
<P>
   The whale is one of three Northern right whales reportedly
entangled in fishing gear off the Massachusetts coast right now,
the first time that Landry could recall that more than one right
whale was in danger. Unfortunately, he said, observers have lost
track of the other two animals.
</P>
<P>
   Entanglements with fishing gear are the second leading
human-induced cause of death _ behind ship collisions _ for the
right whales, a species that has failed to recover more than 60
years since the end of whale-hunting. Already, lobster traps and
other fixed fishing gear are banned in Cape Cod Bay during certain
times of year to prevent even more entanglements.
</P>
<P>
   The drama began last weekend after an environmental organization
spotted an entangled whale 80 miles east of the island of
Nantucket, but lost the animal in the fog. A federal surveillance
plane found the animal again, and Mayo flew out by helicopter to
the Coast Guard cutter Diligence to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to reach the entangled whale on Saturday night,
Mayo approached the animal on Sunday morning in a hard-bottomed
inflatable raft, and attached the satellite tagging device. Now,
the center is using the tag to track the whale's movements on its
Internet homepage, www.coastalstudies.org.
</P>
<P>
   Once the weather clears, Mayo and the crew will return to the
whale, this time to cut away the fishing lines.
</P>
<P>
   The entanglement off Nantucket comes six weeks after the death
of another right whale, nicknamed Staccato, off Cape Cod when it
was apparently struck by a ship. The loss of Staccato, the mother
of at least six whales, was painful, since she was one of the most
prolific breeders left in the species.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Marine Fisheries Service were hoping
for a happier ending with the entangled whale off Nantucket, which
may be identified by its nickname once aerial photos of its
markings can be studied.

 &HT;    Gore makes call for faith-based solutions in violent society
 &HT;    (EDS: MOVING IN (W) Washington and (A) General news categories.)
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vice President Al Gore came to Atlanta on Monday and
proposed that the government subsidize religious organizations so
that ``the unique power of faith'' can combat social ills.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking at an adult rehabilitation center run by the
Salvation Army, embraced an idea first offered by Republicans as he
called for ``a new partnership'' between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith- and value-based organizations'' already have shown ``a
muscular commitment'' to facing the nation's social problems, Gore
said, and a partnership with government would allow them to have an
even greater impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen the difference faith-based organizations make,''
Gore said, citing the experiences of his wife, Tipper, in working
with the homeless at Christ Church in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the lesson to the nation is clear: In those
instances where the unique power of faith can help us meet the
crushing social challenges that are otherwise impossible to meet
... we should explore carefully tailored partnerships with our
faith community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, the vice president went to Conyers, where he
met privately for more than 45 minutes at Rockdale Baptist Church
with the families of students who were wounded in last week's
shootings at Heritage High School.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight at the meeting, and media were kept at a
distance.
</P>
<P>
   At the rehab center earlier, Gore was introduced by Bradford
Culpepper, a resident of the rehabilitation center who marveled
that he had the opportunity to stand on the same platform with the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also shared the podium with Atlanta firefighter Matt
Mosely, whose daring rescue of a man trapped on a burning crane
mesmerized viewers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposed expanding the so-called ``Charitable Choice''
provision of the 1996 welfare overhaul law that allows states to
enlist ``faith-based'' organizations to provide basic services to
help move people from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must dare to embrace faith-based approaches that advance
our shared goals as Americans,'' he said. To do so would usher in
``a new era of civil society collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a former divinity student at Vanderbilt University, said
that approach should also be used for other social services, such
as drug treatment, homelessness and the prevention of youth
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that some civil liberties experts object that such
support could breach the constitutional wall between church and
state, Gore said there should be ``clear and strict safeguards''
against the government promoting a particular religious view.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president made a veiled reference to former President
Bush's emphasis on volunteerism, rather than expanded government
programs, in addressing social ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some past national political leaders have asked us to rely on
a fragile patchwork of well-intentioned volunteerism to feed the
hungry and house the homeless,'' he said. ``That approach,
optimistic though it was, was not adequate for the problems too
many Americans face. It left too many American children behind to
suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   From Conyers, Gore returned to Atlanta for a reception and
private dinner that were expected to net about $350,000 for his
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Gore's
address, which his campaign promoted as a major statement on
values, came as the vice president began a three-day campaign swing
through the South.
</P>
<P>
   Gore struck similar themes earlier in the day in Orlando at a
luncheon that netted his presidential campaign an estimated
$250,000. The vice president was flying late Monday night to Texas,
where he plans two more days of events.
</P>
<P>
   His press office said Gore planned today to announce a
regulation reassuring families that enrolling for government
benefits would not affect their immigration status.

TIMES CO. CREATES UMBRELLA ON-LINE SUBSIDIARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times Co., owner of The Boston Globe, said Monday
it will consolidate its Internet holdings into a new business unit
called Times Company Digital.
</P>
<P>
   ``By aggregating our portfolio of Internet assets into one
business unit, we will sharpen our strategic focus and gain the
flexibility to bring our digital future to scale,'' Arthur
Sulzberger Jr., chairman of Times Co., said in a statement. ``This
step significantly advances our ability to build a high-quality,
high-valued Internet presence and to respond even more quickly to
the fast-moving Web marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Times Company Digital will include The New York Times on the Web
(www.nytimes.com), which has 7 million registered users; the
Globe's boston.com (www.boston.com), the country's largest regional
gateway, with more than 29 million page views in April; New York
Today (www.nytoday.com), an on-line source of lifestyle and
entertainment news in New York City; and Wine Today
(www.winetoday.com) a site for news on the California Wine Country.
The division will comprise almost 50 Web sites in all, including
sites operated by Times Co.'s regional newspapers, magazines, and
broadcast group.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from Internet properties operated by Times Co. is
expected to total $24 million to $26 million this year, the company
forecasted. In 1998, new media properties accounted for $18 million
of Times Co.'s $2.9 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is probably not profitable for the New York
Times, but it is a growing business and if they wanted to spin it
out as a separate company, it makes it easier to do now,'' said
Mary Ann Winter, media analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   A Times spokeswoman said the company is always looking at ways
to increase shareholder value, and that management has explored and
will continue to examine various options.
</P>
<P>
   The Times is not the only media company reorganizing its on-line
offerings. Last week, Tribune Co. announced that it will create
Tribune Interactive, a unit for the on-line sites of its four
newspapers, 17 television stations, and other Internet-related
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sulzberger announced that Martin A. Nisenholtz, president of the
New York Times Electronic Media Co., will become chief executive of
Times Company Digital.
</P>
<P>
   Times Co. stock closed Monday at 34 3/4 on the New York Stock
Exchange, down 5/16.

`HOME IMPROVEMENT' CLOSES UP SHOP; DON'T MISS THE OUTTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TV stars usually say they don't watch much TV. Many say they
don't even own a TV. Too busy, don't you know.
</P>
<P>
   So it's refreshing to know that Patricia Richardson _ Jill
Taylor of ``Home Improvement'' _ watches TV. Even more refreshing
to know she likes ``Everybody Loves Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's edgy and it hits on some real nerves of family life,''
Richardson said via conference call. ``It's the kind of show I
always wanted our show to be more of.''
</P>
<P>
   Not gonna happen. After eight seasons, ``Home Improvement'' airs
its last original episode Tuesday night _ a 90-minute special that
incorporates clips from the past, a continuation of last week's
story line about the family moving to Indiana, and a half-hour of
blooper outtakes.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the outtakes are the funniest part of Tuesday night's
swan dive. I mean swan song. They are so natural. Or, as they like
to say in TV land, so organic. Actually, I'm never quite sure what
TV producers mean when they say their product is organic, but I
think it has something to do with not being artificial as opposed
to not having been sprayed with DDT.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, ``Home Improvement'' never struck me as very
natural. I may be in the minority, because the ABC series continues
to show up in the Top 20, but it always seemed about as authentic
as Pamela Anderson, the first ``Tool Time'' Girl.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple hundred episodes, Richardson said she, too, would
have liked a ``more real'' take on the Taylor family.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) I was opposed by people who wanted to make family life
seem very pretty,'' said Richardson, a divorced mother of three.
She added: ``Shows that present vanilla are on their way out
because they're boring to watch.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Myrna Barzelatto knows that what happened to her is
not, technically, a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   After all, she was simply swindled out of her life savings _
hundreds of thousands of dollars _ along with other New Yorkers
who, together with her, lost at least $20 million. They thought
they were investing in ultra-safe securities backed by banks and
real estate; instead, they were victims of a long-running Ponzi
scheme orchestrated by a man they had considered a friend.
</P>
<P>
   As she describes the betrayals, her constant worries about
money, another victim's loss of a house, all the marriages bruised
and retirements postponed, Mrs. Barzelatto says the same thing over
and over: ``This is a violent crime.''
</P>
<P>
   And a small but growing group of people would like to see it
treated that way. The victims' rights movement, which two decades
ago began demanding recognition and help for those who have
suffered from violent crimes, is now turning its attention to those
injured by white-collar crime.
</P>
<P>
   Their advocates have already succeeded in persuading Congress to
allow money from a special fund for crime victims to be used to
help those injured by economic crimes, and the first federally
financed pilot programs began last year. These efforts are likely
to be expanded in coming years because of the growing recognition
of ``just how devastating these crimes can be,'' said Kathryn M.
Turman, acting director of the Office for Victims of Crime in the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   And the victims themselves are becoming increasingly assertive.
They have begun to insist on their right to participate in court
proceedings by speaking when the criminals who stole their money
are sentenced. And they are setting up self-help groups, including
one in Los Angeles for people whose credit records have been ruined
by charge-card thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the movement to assist these victims is a surge in their
numbers. For while violent crime has plummeted nationwide,
white-collar crime against individuals has risen sharply, according
to law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   The crimes range from securities frauds to sweepstakes schemes
to identity theft _ using someone's Social Security number or other
personal data to apply for credit cards, loans or even fake
driver's licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more swindles, more frauds,'' said Robert M.
Morgenthau, the district attorney in Manhattan. The strong economy
and booming stock market help explain the trend, he said, adding,
``Honey attracts bears.''
</P>
<P>
   New uses of technology, especially Americans' infatuation with
the Internet, have contributed to a shift to defrauding individuals
from defrauding institutions, like savings and loan associations
or, as in the big insider trading cases, the overall stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that has dramatically changed is the availability of
mass technology that lets those with criminal motivations reach a
much wider audience of victims,'' said James K. Robinson, assistant
attorney general for the criminal division of the justice
department.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no government statistics on the incidence of
financial crime, complaints to watchdog groups and regulatory
agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission have jumped by
20 percent in two years. Last week, the FBI announced it was
setting up a special complaint center for Internet fraud that would
collect data and analyze trends.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of American households, almost 40 percent of
respondents said they had been defrauded in some way in the last
year, the National White Collar Crime Center, a clearinghouse and
training center for law-enforcement groups, reported this month.
Though most complained of consumer rip-offs like unnecessary auto
repairs, dozens of the 1,169 who replied in the survey said they
had lost money through Internet schemes, credit-card fraud and
investment swindles.
</P>
<P>
   Groups and government agencies that help crime victims say they
have been slow to respond to this flood in part because the victims
themselves are often too embarrassed to come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Y. Kusic said she fell into a deep depression after she and
her husband, a lawyer, invested in a Florida real estate
development that turned out to be fake and cost investors about
$100 million. While her experience prompted her to become a
professional consultant on financial crimes, Ms. Kusic, who is
based near Washington, D.C., points out that most people who lose
big sums must put all their energy into trying to stay afloat
financially.
</P>
<P>
   Many victims of con men speak of the betrayal as the
psychological equivalent of rape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never get over this _ it is far worse than a rape of
the body,'' said one woman who said she was sexually assaulted at
gunpoint earlier in her life, before losing her savings in the same
scheme that entrapped Mrs. Barzelatto. ``Every moment I'm reminded,
every waking moment,'' said the woman, who spoke only on the
condition that neither her name nor the amount of her losses be
printed. After a lifetime of hard work, she said, she now worries
about making the payments on her medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Stories like this do not surprise those who counsel victims of
financial crimes. ``When I talk about how the impact can be as
serious as with violent crime, some people's eyes glaze over, but
I've had attempted suicides,'' said Debbie Deem, who manages the
victims' assistance program for the United States Attorney in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The victims of financial crimes are a diverse lot. Senior
citizens often fall prey to telemarketing frauds, but people in
their 30s and 40s complain most often that they have been defrauded
over the Internet, according to the National Consumers League. And
at least one federal study suggests that young, well-educated
people are the most likely to fall for swindles.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are victims of financial crimes always well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are poor, and told you have won $1 million in the
lottery, that's appealing to everyone,'' said Marta Sotomayor,
executive director of the National Hispanic Council on Aging, which
runs a fraud prevention program.
</P>
<P>
   There are still few programs to help victims of economic crimes.
That frustrates people like Lisa Curtis, the victims' advocate in
the Denver district attorney's office, which has one of the most
active economic crime programs in the country (one of its cases
just ended in a 96-year sentence for a man who ran a fraud ring).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're considered second-class citizens,'' Ms. Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, government and private groups have begun to respond to
the needs of these victims. Two years ago, Congress made the legal
change to permit money in the Federal Crime Victims Fund to go to
programs that help those injured by economic crimes, although the
victims themselves cannot receive direct financial aid. Previously,
this money could be used only to help those hurt by violent crime,
though most of the money in the fund comes from fines paid by
white-collar criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The first Federally financed programs after the congressional
change began last year. In October, the Office for Victims of Crime
in the Justice Department released a video for federal employees
called ``Victims of Fraud: Beyond Financial Loss'' to show how
devastated these lives are, said Ms. Turman.
</P>
<P>
   The justice department is also financing some demonstration
programs, like one run by the Oregon Division of Senior and
Disabled Services that sends counselors to the homes of older
people whose names turn up on ``mooch lists'' _ lists of people who
have fallen for schemes in the past _ seized from illegal
telemarketing operations.
</P>
<P>
   On the private side, the California Public Research Interest
Group helped Elsie Strong, a California businesswoman, set up a
support group for victims of identity theft. Ms. Strong says it
took her years to clear her credit record after someone took out
five charge cards in her name, ran up big bills and stopped making
payments.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Center for Victims of Crime has set up a
special association for lawyers who specialize in representing
crime victims who turn to civil courts to attempt to recover money
after they have been defrauded.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of the legal association alarms some prosecutors,
who worry that it will encourage victims to sue them for not
pursuing cases even when the evidence is weak. Just the process of
having to notify all the victims in a big fraud case is an
overwhelming undertaking, some complain.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors lobbied successfully for the narrowing of a proposed
constitutional amendment on victims' rights sponsored in the Senate
by Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Jon Kyl,
Republican of Arizona, to exclude victims of financial crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The narrowing has caused a split among victims' rights groups,
with some, like the National Center for Victims of Crimes,
withdrawing their support for the amendment, said David Beatty,
director of public policy for the center.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest dream for those who have suffered from financial
crime is not a constitutional amendment; it is getting some money
back, preferably from the people who stole from them. That seldom
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Judges do sometimes order people who are guilty of financial
crimes to make restitution to their victims. Victim Services, a
nonprofit agency which handles many of the restitution orders in
New York City courts, is pushing prosecutors to ask for repayment
more often, ``because the sense of accountability is so
important,'' said Paula A. Rogowsky, program director for the
Brooklyn Criminal and Supreme Courts.
</P>
<P>
   Even when repayment is ordered, victims usually collect only
pennies on the dollar of what they are owed or get nothing at all.
The perpetrators have frequently spent all the cash; in many cases,
prosecutors suspect, they have hidden the assets. Some try to use
bankruptcy protection to make it harder for their victims to
collect anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were finding is that by the time we get there, there
is nothing left,'' said Melinda L. Haag, deputy chief of the
general crimes section in the Office of the United State Attorney
in San Francisco. Ms. Haag directs a pilot program that attempts to
deal with this problem by assigning fraud investigators to track
the assets of suspected perpetrators before they are indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Though the program is only a few months old, it is already
attracting the attention of people like Mary Jo White, the United
States Attorney in Manhattan, who prosecutes hundreds of
white-collar criminals a year and supervised the case against
Gerald P. Hirsch, who pleaded guilty to six counts of mail fraud in
the scheme that victimized Myrna Barzelatto and faces a prison term
of about four to six years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White hopes to meet with fellow prosecutors to explore ways
of improving restitution to victims of financial crimes. Getting
money back, she said, ``will make them feel better than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Barzelatto would agree. From her home in White Plains, she
is helping to organize her fellow victims, who hope to speak at the
July sentencing of Hirsch. While she hopes he gets the longest
possible sentence as a just punishment for all the harm he has
caused, she said, ``I'd be very happy to let this guy go free if it
would let me have my money back.''

SETBACKS FOR DEUTSCHE TELEKOM'S GLOBAL ASPIRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ It is still Europe's biggest telephone
company and it still seems intent on spending billions of dollars
on acquisitions around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Deutsche Telekom AG lost more than just a takeover battle
when Olivetti SpA trumped its $81 billion bid to acquire Italy's
dominant phone carrier, Telecom Italia. It also suffered at least
two costly blows to its global aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   It all but destroyed its alliance with France Telecom, which
accused Deutsche Telekom of double-dealing when it made its Italian
bid. The French utility is now suing. That rift threatens to
destroy Global One, the two companies' money-losing joint venture
with Sprint of the United States that provides worldwide business
services.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti's victory also greatly strengthens a formidable rival
of Deutsche Telekom, Mannesmann AG. Mannesmann is its biggest
competitor in Germany in both wireless and traditional phone
services, and it has important stakes in other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Olivetti's plan to finance the takeover, Mannesmann
will buy Olivetti's stake in Italy's second-largest cellular phone
carrier, Omnitel Pronto Italia, as well as Infostrada, a competitor
to Telecom Italia in fixed-line services. Mannesmann will pay 7.6
billion euros, or about $8.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mannesmann struck gold,'' said Dwayne Taylor, a
telecommunications analyst at Robert Fleming Securities. ``They
paid a reasonable prices for a very good property, which isn't too
easy to do these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sommer, Deutsche Telekom's chairman, is to meet with the
board on Tuesday to sort through the company's options. Over the
weekend, Sommer hinted that he had not given up and was ready to
discuss an alliance with Olivetti's chairman, Roberto Colaninno.
</P>
<P>
   But while Colaninno left himself open to such talks, most
analysts doubt that Olivetti has any interest in giving up its
hard-won control.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Deutsche Telekom say that Sommer is certain to
attempt other international moves in the months ahead. Both
Deutsche Telekom and Mannesmann are believed to have bid about $16
billion for One2One, the British cellular phone company that has
been put up for sale by its owners, Cable and Wireless PLC and
Mediaone Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer has made it clear that he is looking for acquisitions in
the United States, as well. Deutsche Telekom plans to raise more
than $10 billion through a stock offering later this year, and
Sommer has said that the money will be used to finance
international expansion. It already owns 10 percent of Sprint, one
of the largest long-distance carriers in the United States. But
France Telecom also owns 10 percent of Sprint and would almost
certainly try to block a German takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer seems increasingly pressed by hostile challengers. Within
Germany, Deutsche Telekom has lost nearly 30 percent of its
domestic long-distance market to new rivals since the market was
deregulated at the start of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sommer stabilized the decline by cutting prices as much
as 70 percent in recent months, the cost has been high: Deutsche
Telekom's revenue declined 6.7 percent in the first quarter of 1999
and earnings from continuing businesses fell 1.9 percent. At the
same time, Mannesmann has become an extraordinarily powerful rival.
</P>
<P>
   Once an old-line manufacturing conglomerate known for industrial
pipes and automotive equipment, Mannesmann has transformed itself
into a fast-growing telecommunications business. It controls
Germany's second cellular phone license through Mannesmann
Mobilfunk, whose partners include AT&AMP;T and Airtouch Communications,
and is running about even with Deutsche Telekom's cellular
subsidiary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mannesmann has also become the biggest rival in fixed-line phone
service. It controls a competing German telephone network called
Arcor, and recently bought the country's third-biggest competitor,
Otelo, from Veba AG.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Mannesmann is ahead of Deutsche Telekom in
building a pan-European business. As a partner in France with
Vivendi SA, it owns minority stakes in the country's second-largest
wireless carrier, SFR, and in Cegetel, France Telecom's competitor
in traditional phone services.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann also owns a majority stake in Telering, an Austrian
company that acquired that country's fourth cellular phone license
earlier this month. Telering already operates high-speed phone
networks in Austria for business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mannesmann appears to have outmaneuvered Deutsche Telekom in
Italy, Europe's fastest-growing mobile phone market. Though
competition has been slow to take off in Italy's traditional
telephone market, it has been booming in cellular phones. By
acquiring control of Omnitel from Olivetti, Mannesmann will control
national franchises in Europe's two biggest markets. The highly
profitable mobile phone business will make it easier for Mannesmann
to finance its attack on the traditional telephone market,
including Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann has also been fortifying its war chest. It recently
raised $3.1 billion through Europe's biggest corporate bond
offering to date.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer and Deutsche Telekom face competition, as well, from
companies building high-speed European fiber optic networks. These
include British Telecommunications PLC; Colt Telecommunications
PLC, which is building high-speed fiber-optic rings in cities
across Europe; and MCI Worldcom, which is building a broad network
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Olivetti's remarkable success made clear, Sommer failed
to persuade institutional investors that combining the two former
national monopolies could overcome these competitive threats. When
Deutsche Telekom executives paraded their forthcoming stock
offering in a ``road show'' on both sides of the Atlantic, many
were sharply critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't provide enough information,'' said Michael
Schneider, portfolio manager at Deka Telemedien, a large German
mutual fund. As Olivetti proceeded with its own tender offer,
Deutsche Telekom's shares stagnated to the point where its
all-stock offer was only marginally higher than Olivetti's offer of
$11.50 in cash and securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their big miscalculation was thinking that this would be the
panacea for investors,'' Taylor of Robert Fleming Securities said.
``The industrial plan was not brilliant by any stretch of the
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   And it seems hard to believe that Sommer can patch up his
alliance with France Telecom. Asserting that Deutsche Telekom broke
contractual agreements by making the Italian bid without consulting
its partner, France Telecom filed a lawsuit last week for damages
in the ``billions of euros.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, neither the French nor the German phone utilities have
said that they would break up Global One, which provides global
networking services for multinational companies. That venture has
lost hundreds of millions of dollars, and none of the partners has
been happy. But without it, analysts say Deutsche Telekom would be
hard pressed to keep up with other international alliances.

 &HT;    Gore makes call for faith-based solutions in violent society
 &HT;    (EDS: 1st writethru _ adds grafs 8-10. MOVING IN (W) Washington
and (A) General news categories.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vice President Al Gore came to Atlanta on Monday and
proposed that the government subsidize religious organizations so
that ``the unique power of faith'' can combat social ills.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking at an adult rehabilitation center run by the
Salvation Army, embraced an idea first offered by Republicans as he
called for ``a new partnership'' between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith- and value-based organizations'' already have shown ``a
muscular commitment'' to facing the nation's social problems, Gore
said, and a partnership with government would allow them to have an
even greater impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen the difference faith-based organizations make,''
Gore said, citing the experiences of his wife, Tipper, in working
with the homeless at Christ Church in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the lesson to the nation is clear: In those
instances where the unique power of faith can help us meet the
crushing social challenges that are otherwise impossible to meet
... we should explore carefully tailored partnerships with our
faith community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, the vice president went to Conyers, where he
met privately for more than 45 minutes at Rockdale Baptist Church
with the families of six Heritage High School students who were
shot last week by a fellow student.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight at the meeting, and media were kept at a
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Malarney, the Rockdale school board chairman, said the Gore
took off his coat, put his foot up on a chair and told the
students, ``You tell me how you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Malarney said the vice president talked with each of the 50
people present individually during the one-hour stop at the church,
about 5 miles from Heritage. The 152-year-old church is the
namesake for the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an opportunity for (Gore) to meet in private with the
families,'' said Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   At the rehab center earlier, Gore was introduced by Bradford
Culpepper, a resident of the rehabilitation center who marveled
that he had the opportunity to stand on the same platform with the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also shared the podium with Atlanta firefighter Matt
Mosely, whose daring rescue of a man trapped on a burning crane
mesmerized viewers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposed expanding the so-called ``Charitable Choice''
provision of the 1996 welfare overhaul law that allows states to
enlist ``faith-based'' organizations to provide basic services to
help move people from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must dare to embrace faith-based approaches that advance
our shared goals as Americans,'' he said. To do so would usher in
``a new era of civil society collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a former divinity student at Vanderbilt University, said
that approach should also be used for other social services, such
as drug treatment, homelessness and the prevention of youth
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that some civil liberties experts object that such
support could breach the constitutional wall between church and
state, Gore said there should be ``clear and strict safeguards''
against the government promoting a particular religious view.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president made a veiled reference to former President
Bush's emphasis on volunteerism, rather than expanded government
programs, in addressing social ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some past national political leaders have asked us to rely on
a fragile patchwork of well-intentioned volunteerism to feed the
hungry and house the homeless,'' he said. ``That approach,
optimistic though it was, was not adequate for the problems too
many Americans face. It left too many American children behind to
suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   After the trip to Conyers, Gore returned to Atlanta for a
reception and private dinner that were expected to net about
$350,000 for his campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination. Gore's address, which his campaign promoted as a major
statement on values, came as the vice president began a three-day
campaign swing through the South.
</P>
<P>
   Gore struck similar themes earlier in the day in Orlando at a
luncheon that netted his presidential campaign an estimated
$250,000. The vice president was flying late Monday night to Texas,
where he plans two more days of events.
</P>
<P>
   His press office said Gore planned today to announce a
regulation reassuring families that enrolling for government
benefits would not affect their immigration status.

ADVERTISING COLUMN: KAPLAN THALER GROUP TO BE ACQUIRED BY MACMANUS
GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The agency responsible for that much-discussed
Clairol Herbal Essences campaign in which women simulate sexual
ecstasy now has some excitement of its own: a new owner.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan Thaler Group, a creatively focused independent
advertising and entertainment shop in New York, has reached an
agreement in principle to be acquired by MacManus Group, which owns
agencies including N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners and D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP;
Bowles Communications. Financial terms of the deal, to be formally
announced today, are not being disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan Thaler, founded in September 1997 by the creative veteran
Linda Kaplan Thaler, estimates its billings for this year at $145
million from clients including the American Red Cross and the
United Jewish Appeal, as well as the Bristol-Myers Squibb &UR;  &LR; Co., for
Herbal Essences and five other Clairol brands and for corporate
branding programs and pharmaceutical projects.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan Thaler joins a lengthening list of small and midsize
agencies that are being engulfed and devoured, as Mel Brooks would
say, by the Madison Avenue giants. MacManus is the world's
10th-largest agency group, with estimated billings of $7.6 billion
from such clients as the Coca-Cola &UR;  &LR; Co. the General Motors &UR;  &LR; Corp.,
Mars &UR;  &LR; Inc. and the Procter &AMP; Gamble &UR;  &LR; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent examples of this widespread consolidation trend
include the purchases of the New York agencies Avrett Free &AMP;
Ginsberg and Berenter Greenhouse &AMP; Webster by the Bozell Worldwide
unit of True North Communications; the acquisitions of Citron
Haligman Bedecarre in San Francisco and Jordan McGrath Case &AMP;
Partners in New York by the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas
Advertising, and the sale of a majority stake in Mullen Advertising
in Wenham, Mass., to the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group
of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew a zillion times more fast than we thought,'' Ms.
Kaplan Thaler, president and chief executive at Kaplan Thaler, said
during a breakfast interview yesterday. ``The clients coming to us
are big clients.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a couple instances in the recent past when we
wanted desperately to pitch business, but we knew it required media
capabilities, research capabilities,'' she added. ``Now I can talk
about how we have media capabilities, research capabilities,
worldwide capabilities,'' through MacManus.
</P>
<P>
   MacManus plans to operate Kaplan Thaler as a freestanding,
autonomous unit, reporting directly to Roy J. Bostock, chairman and
chief executive at MacManus in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Linda and I do our jobs well, that independence will be
maintained and hopefully enhanced,'' said Bostock, who joined Ms.
Kaplan Thaler for the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have significant confidence we're smart enough to make sure
that continues,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaplan Thaler agreed, declaring that it would be
``counterproductive to do anything other than continue doing what
we were doing'' at Kaplan Thaler.
</P>
<P>
   For MacManus, Bostock said, owning Kaplan Thaler ``enables us to
compete for the kinds of businesses we're not able to without Linda
and her talented group of people.'' The agency has 35 other
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows Linda is a world-class talent,'' Bostock said.
``And that's obviously what this business is all about, talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaplan Thaler, 48, is a former comedy writer and performer
who worked at the big J. Walter Thompson and Wells BDDP agencies
before founding Kaplan Thaler. She is known for campaigns for
brands like Herbal Essences, Eastman Kodak &UR;  &LR;  and Toys ``R'' Us &UR;  &LR; 
that seek to make emotional connections with consumers using
tactics ranging from spicy humor and celebrities to heart-tugging
schmaltz and uplifting music.

<P>
   Indeed, as Ms. Kaplan Thaler showed a reel of her work, Bostock
tapped his coffee cup against a table to the beat of a tune during
one commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Bostock said he anticipated ``a lot of cross-fertilization''
between Kaplan Thaler and units of MacManus, which include Blue
Marble Advanced Communications Group, specializing in interactive
advertising; Manning, Selvage &AMP; Lee, public relations, and
Mediavest Worldwide, media services.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Mediavest is involved in television programming
and Kaplan Thaler has produced films and television programs for
clients, including an hourlong special about the Red Cross that ran
on CBS in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about creating ways to promote clients' brands whatever
they may be,'' Ms. Kaplan Thaler said, ``whether a TV commercial, a
TV special, a book or a CD-ROM.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaplan Thaler said that her decision to sell Kaplan Thaler
predated the agency's loss in March of the creative portion of the
account of Toys ``R'' Us, with billings estimated at $50 million.
Kaplan Thaler was eliminated from a review for the creative duties,
which were reassigned May 10 to the Leo &UR;  &LR; Burnett &UR;  &LR; Co. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to grow the way we want,'' Ms. Kaplan Thaler said,
``this kind of partnership is absolutely essential.''

   NEW YORK _ Two current trends in footwear _ ballerina flats and
mules _ have converged for summer as the (unfortunately named)
ballet mule. In solid colors or with contrasting toes, the new
mules are trimmed with the little bow-tied loops that mark dancers'
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Klein's ballet mules ($145) are in all-black with patent
toes at Bloomingdale's, in all-black or in beige with black toes at
Bergdorf Goodman and in all-black or in white with black toes at
Macy's. Cynthia Rowley's version ($160) comes in all-white or
all-black at Bloomingdale's; in black, white or pale gray at
Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   Bergdorf Goodman also has Sigerson Morrison's mules ($198) in
black or white and Rebecca Moses' mules ($290) in pale blue, peach
or dark purple, all with contrasting bows.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's also has two slightly different ballet shoes: Joan
Halpern's with flat bows on the front ($275) and BCBGs takeoff on
point shoes, satin mules that have squared-off toes ($148).

 &HT;    Students return to school following shooting
 &HT;    By Leon Stafford

<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ Heritage High School students _ together as a
school for the first time Monday since last week's shootings _
hugged, signed yearbooks and said their goodbyes to the 1998-99
school year.
</P>
<P>
   They came in droves, filling the student parking lot by 8:10
a.m. and streaming off school buses. Some walked arm in arm,
preceding as if it were an ordinary day. One student held a sign
that read, ``We will survive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had so much school spirit until this happened,''
said senior April Sargent, 17. She said the buzz among her
classmates was that they wanted everyone to know how proud they
were to be associated with Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Lowell Biddy said Monday's attendance was 90 percent,
a number that included four of the six students shot _ Brian
Barnhardt, Ryan Rosa, Jason Cheek and Drake Hoy. Cania Cullins had
said earlier that she would not be at school Monday. Stephanie
Laster was still hospitalized in Atlanta on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy, who had not spoken to the media since the shootings,
recounted early Monday a brief conversation he had with suspected
gunman, 15-year-old T.J. Solomon, after the Heritage sophomore
surrendered to administrators about nine minutes after he fired
into a crowd of fellow students last Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was quite hysterical,'' Biddy said. ``I was asking him if
he was OK. And then I asked the big questions. I asked if those are
blanks, and he said no. Then I asked if he had acted alone, and he
said yes. And then he started sobbing, and he said, `Mr. Biddy, I
don't know why I did this. I just don't know why I did this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Several students said they came back because they wanted to get
their yearbooks, which administrators had planned to release last
Thursday. The homeroom period was extended to almost two hours so
that the students could get the books signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just real happy to see everybody was alright and were
back,'' said Linda Ayala, 16, a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   However, most left after the first class period, opting to go
home early and start their summer vacations. School officially ends
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jacquelyn Whalen, 15, said she was a little apprehensive about
returning to school, but wanted to say goodbye to her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is okay,'' the freshman said of the atmosphere.
``It's practically normal, just a lot of police.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockdale County Sheriff's Department had about 20 deputies
on the scene patrolling the grounds and inside the building.
Another six Georgia State Patrol troopers directed traffic onto the
campus. Parents also were patrolling the hallways in an effort to
keep students safe.
</P>
<P>
   The news media, whose numbers have dwindled significantly from
last week when a horde descended on the school, was kept at bay and
not allowed on campus to talk to students.
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale Schools Superintendent Don Peccia praised the student
turnout, saying that normally it would not have been that high the
last day of classes.
</P>
<P>
   For Jenni Buchanan, the option given students to skip exams if
pleased with their final grade was a blessing in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I took my economics exam I would be here taking
class this summer,'' the 17-year-old graduating senior said as she
left school for the last time.

LAWMAKERS TOLD PLAN TO DOUBLE PRESIDENT'S SALARY ISN'T ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former top White House officials told lawmakers
Monday that a House plan to double to the president's salary to
$400,000 annually doesn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   The figure should be $500,000, according to Kenneth Duberstein,
who served as chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the compensation of the leader of the free
world, not about the salary of the chief of a small startup company
or the head of a third world country,'' Duberstein said.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before a House government reform subcommittee, six
other former White House officials agreed that a $500,000 annual
salary would be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   They were John Sununu, chief of staff to President George Bush;
Alexander Haig, chief of staff to President Richard Nixon and
secretary of state under Reagan; James R. Jones, special assistant
to President Lyndon Johnson; Robert Hartmann; counsel to President
Gerald Ford, Samuel Skinner, another Bush chief of staff, and
Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty III, former chief of staff to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress isn't likely to accept a $500,000 figure. Last week
a House Appropriations subcommittee approved a plan to raise the
president's salary from $200,000 to $400,000 beginning Jan. 20,
2001. Clinton would not be affected by any pay boost.
</P>
<P>
   The president's salary has been the same since 1969 when
Congress raised it from $100,000 to $200,000. Richard Nixon was
then president.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the $200,000 salary, Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif.,
chairman of the government reform panel, said, ``I am sure to most
Americans, a salary of that amount seems to be a lot of money and
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Horn pointed out that ``it is the pay for one of the most
difficult, demanding and important jobs on the face of the earth''
and added that he supports the House appropriations panel's plan to
double it.
</P>
<P>
   Haig and the other former officials noted that the pressures on
the president have greatly increased over the last 30 years with
the rise of instant communication and around-the-clock news.
</P>
<P>
   ``People demand answers almost instantaneously to every domestic
and international crisis,'' often forcing the president to make
snap decisions rather than thinking things through, Haig said.
</P>
<P>
   If the 1969 salary were adjusted to 1998 dollars, it would be
$888,283, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), a
research arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When George Washington took office in 1789, Congress established
a salary of $25,000 a year, according to CRS. If adjusted for a 2.5
percent inflation rate, Washington's salary would be worth more
than $4 million today, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's salary was increased from $25,000 to $50,000
when President Ulysses Grant began his second term in 1873 and
again in 1909 to $75,000 when President William Howard Taft took
office. In 1949 it was raised to $100,000 when President Harry
Truman, who took office in 1945 after the death of Franklin
Roosevelt, began his first full term. There was no other increase
until 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Sununu said Congress should also consider reviewing the
president's salary every eight or 12 years to better keep up with
cost of living changes.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Congress may alter a president's salary only between
terms. If it doesn't raise the pay before 2001, when Clinton leaves
the White House, the next opportunity won't come until 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, if Congress doesn't raise the president's salary,
the amount paid the vice president, the chief justice of the United
States and the House speaker could outstrip the president's sum by
2004.
</P>
<P>
   These officials currently earn $175,400, but their salaries,
like those of most other federal employees, are adjusted annually
to reflect cost-of-living changes.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone testifying at Monday's favored an increase in
presidential pay.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ruskin, director of a nonprofit, watchdog group called the
Congressional Accountability Project, said $200,000 is a ``great
sum of money.'' Ruskin's organization receives funding from
consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Ruskin noted that the president lives rent-free in the White
House, gets free travel expenses, leaves office with a $152,000
annual pension ``plus a near-certain prospect, if desired, of
becoming a multi-millionaire'' afterward.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion poll released Monday finds the idea of a presidential
pay raise has lukewarm support among the public. When told that the
president's salary has not been raised since 1969, 49 percent
favored a pay boost while 39 percent opposed it, according to the
survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press.
</P>
<P>
   But when people were also told the president now earns $200,000
and gets housing and travel expenses, 41 percent of people favored
a pay raise and 55 percent opposed it, the poll showed.

GM SHAREHOLDERS TO RECEIVE MORE THAN 82% OF DELPHI AUTOMOTIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The General Motors Corp. is pushing Delphi, its auto
parts maker, out of the nest and into its shareholders' portfolios
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For GM the spinoff ends a 90-year tradition of vertical
integration _ a strategy of making most of the parts as well as the
final product. It began the transformation in February, when it
sold 100 million Delphi shares, or 17.7 percent of the company, to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   The auto maker plans to spin off the remaining 82.3 percent to
those who are GM shareholders of record as of Tuesday, creating the
nation's 36th-largest company in terms of revenue. The shareholders
will get 70 shares of the Delphi Automotive Systems Corp. for every
100 GM shares they own.
</P>
<P>
   The divestiture is a milestone in the auto maker's continuing
struggle this decade to transform itself from a complacent and
noncompetitive company into a streamlined, more agile organization.
Instead of relying on its in-house auto-parts maker, GM wants to
farm out the business to leaner, cheaper parts makers worldwide, as
other auto makers have done for years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that poses a problem for Delphi because GM has been
its only customer for decades. In anticipation of the spinoff,
Delphi has been furiously slimming down by cutting costs. It also
has been expanding its customer base. Now, for example, it supplies
the power sliding doors not only on GM's Pontiac, Oldsmobile and
Chevrolet minivans, but also on a number of 1999 models of GM's
competitors: the Ford Windstar, the Toyota Sienna and the
Volkswagen Caravelle, which is sold only in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the challenge is huge. Last year, 78 percent of Delphi's
$28.5 billion in sales were to GM. Just $6.2 billion, or 22
percent, came from other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But J.T. Battenberg 3d, Delphi's chairman and chief executive,
says the company's independence presents an opportunity to win
contracts other auto makers have been reluctant to award to a
subsidiary of a competitor. ``The 30 car companies in the world are
knocking on our door more and more,'' he said in an interview
earlier this month at the company's headquarters in Troy, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point out that such freedom works both ways: the more
than $22 billion in parts Delphi now sells to GM will soon be up
for grabs. ``The independent parts makers say, `Now there's an
opportunity to go sell stuff to General Motors,''' said Maryann N.
Keller, an auto analyst in the New York office of ING Baring, an
international investment bank. ``The big question is: Can Delphi
get business from other auto companies in volumes to offset the
loss of business from General Motors?''
</P>
<P>
   Delphi says it expects to keep GM as a customer and plans to
increase non-GM business by 10 percent a year. ``All of our General
Motors business is competitively priced today,'' Battenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   GM has agreed to keep all current supplier contracts with Delphi
_ typically they run 2 to 10 years. It has also agreed to give
Delphi a chance to match any competitors' bid on a new GM contract
until 2002. After that, it is tough love: Delphi is not assured any
preferences over other suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Delphi will face another challenge: getting
through the year without a costly strike. The three-year contract
between GM and its largest union, the United Automobile Workers,
expires in September, and union leaders have signaled that they are
angered by the Delphi spinoff and plan to make it an issue.
</P>
<P>
   But there is good news for the company, as well: Last week,
Delphi got a boost when Standard &AMP; Poor's announced that it planned
to add the company to its S&AMP;P 500-stock index, increasing demand
for the stock from index mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Delphi closed at $20.9375, off 37.5 cents. With an
estimated price-to-earnings ration at 11.43, many analysts think it
is a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``one of the cheapest stocks in the stock market,'' said
Scott F. Merlis, a managing director and head of the automotive
practice at Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc., who rates the
stock a ``buy.'' &QL;

RUSSIAN ENVOY SEES PROGRESS IN KOSOVO TROOP QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Russian envoy to the Balkans claimed Monday to
have bridged one of the central gaps in peace negotiations between
NATO and Yugoslavia, convincing Western powers of the importance of
letting some Yugoslav forces stay inside Kosovo even after the
bombing stops.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is scheduled to meet with US Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott Wednesday, also repeated his plea
for NATO airstrikes to end, saying the attacks were complicating
the negotiations and eventually ``may spell catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials did not immediately react to Chernomyrdin's
claim, although a White House spokesman said Monday the demand is
still that ``all troops have to withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks coincided with a grim report from UN official Sergio
Vieira de Mello, who led a three-day fact-finding mission into
Kosovo, and emerged from the province Monday describing what he saw
there as ``a lot worse than we expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Serb forces blocked the team from certain areas of
Kosovo, they still managed to interview large numbers of displaced
ethnic Albanians, many of whom were in dire need of humanitarian
aid and military security, he said. At the same time, survivors
indicated that the region had been destroyed by widespread ``ethnic
cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen enough evidence and heard enough testimony to
confirm that there has been an attempt at displacing internally and
externally a shocking number of civilians,'' said de Mello, who is
the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Chernomyrdin's remarks, Talbott has said nothing about
a shift in policy since his meeting with the Russian envoy last
week, and Monday, as the third month of airstrikes began, NATO
officials gave every indication their campaign was continuing as
planned. In the past, officials have insisted that all Yugoslav
troops be withdrawn from Kosovo _ except, possibly, from the areas
around holy sites _ before the bombing is halted.
</P>
<P>
   But Chernomyrdin, who plans to fly to Belgrade Thursday for
further talks, said he had managed to convince NATO of the need to
let some of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's troops stay
inside the province. More than 40,000 Yugoslav troops have been
posted in Kosovo since March 24, and another 10,000 are said to
have been sent there in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has taken two or three weeks to convince our counterparts _
the United States and NATO countries _ that while withdrawing the
(Yugoslav) troops, it's necessary to leave some of them behind,''
Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Monday:
</P>
<P>
   --Yugoslav media reported black-outs in large sections of the
country and a dwindling water supply, following another night of
severe NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said it was targeting military sites only and reported
hitting a radar site and a command center inside Yugoslavia on
Sunday night. At least one tank, nine artillery positions, seven
armored vehicles and 12 mortar positions were hit, according to
NATO spokesman Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz.
</P>
<P>
   --Crowds in the Serbian communities of Krusevac and Alexandrovac
gathered in protest against the local draft, rallying in groups as
large as 2,000 people. Anti-war leaders in the town of Cacak were
stopped for questioning, according to a news agency in neighboring
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   --NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana marked the end of two
months of airstrikes with an announcement that Milosevic ``is
cracking.'' Solana said there was increasing evidence of dissent
inside Yugoslavia, so NATO should stay the course with airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to maintain the strategy at this very moment, which is
producing results rapidly. Therefore we don't want to give the
impression that we are going to change the strategy,'' Solana said
in an interview in Brussels with Associated Press Television News.
</P>
<P>
   --Serb media reported that NATO airstrikes killed as many as 100
people when a jail in Istok was hit Friday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   --Twenty more US warplanes were on their way to join the fight.
The F/A-18 attack jets, flying from their base South Carolina, were
expected to bring the number of NATO planes involved in the
conflict to more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   --Hashim Thaci, the populist leader of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, offered words of comfort in a speech to thousands of refugees
in Kukes, Albania, near the southwest border of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are not alone in our fight. The whole world is
helping us win our freedom,'' Thaci told the cheering crowd. ``We
are now reorganized. We are a better, more efficient force.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NATO members continued to push for a diplomatic
solution to the crisis, looking with cautious optimism toward this
week's meetings in Europe and Belgrade, where Chernomyrdin hopes to
find an end to the military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But it was by no means clear that any solution was imminent.
According to White House officials, the withdrawal of Yugoslav
troops remained a requirement of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no particular breakthrough, but we continue to work
with Mr. Chernomyrdin and'' Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari ``to
find a way to meet the NATO conditions'' to end the conflict, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is all troops have to withdraw, including
military and paramilitary,'' said David Leavy, spokesman for
national security adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger. ``Once
there's a peace agreement, whether there can be a discussion about
having small numbers of troops come back to protect Serb holy sites
under the supervision of peacekeepers, that's something we'd look
at ... down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek echoed the
firmness of US officials Monday. Speaking to Globe editors, he
warned that NATO should be careful not to let war fatigue cause too
many compromises in working out a peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   Geremek, whose nation is one of NATO's newest members, said the
alliance must continue to demand the withdrawal of Serb forces from
Kosovo and the return of all refugees, although the alliance might
give ground in accepting Serb guard units to patrol Kosovo's
borders with Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the war is worth it _ to see that a dictator at the end
of the century cannot impose his will on the international
community,'' said Geremek. ``The Kosovo war is preparing us for the
21st century.''

<P>
   TEL AVIV _ Amid bitter debate over whether an ultrareligious
party should be brought into his coalition, Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak started talks Monday aimed at forming a broad government
to tackle some of Israel's most formidable problems.
</P>
<P>
   With just 26 seats in the 120-seat parliament, Barak's One
Israel alliance must first decide who it wants as its second
largest partner: the Likud Party with 19 seats, or the
ultrareligious Shas Party with 17 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a big coalition, and that means bringing in Shas or
Likud. Otherwise you end up with too many small parties and that's
not good for implementing policies,'' said Ra'anan Cohen, a member
of Labor, which dominates the alliance and is headed by Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, elected with 56 percent of the vote, has said he wants to
form as wide a coalition as possible to ensure strong backing when
he renews peace talks with the Palestinians and tries to implement
his promise to withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The country also faces a bitter internal debate over the role of
religion in the Jewish state and Barak has said he will take steps
to ensure that religious school students do not get a blanket
exemption from compulsory military service.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the campaign debate before the May 17 elections centered
on accusations that religious parties like Shas were trying to turn
Israel into a religious state.
</P>
<P>
   But voters did not give Barak's alliance a majority, leaving him
to figure out which of the other 14 parties in parliament will make
good coalition partners. Barak has until mid-July to form a
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his own party members have called on him to avoid
joining up with Likud, which until recently was headed by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Over the three years that the
Likud-led coalition governed, the peace process with the
Palestinians stalled and relations with all Arab countries
worsened.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many voices raised against a coalition with Shas,
which is liberal when it comes to peace with the Palestinians but
very tough when it comes to demanding further implementation of
Jewish religious law.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors of Shas, which gets most of its support from
working-class Israelis whose origins are in North Africa or the
Middle East, say the party is a danger to democracy because of its
fundamentalist religious views, which are spreading thanks to the
party's state-funded school system.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's victory speeches have been interrupted by chants of
``Just no to Shas'' while his office has been flooded with tens of
thousands of emails and faxes calling on him to keep the party in
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Meretz Party, which has 10 seats in parliament and
usually serves in Labor-led coalition governments, has said it
opposes a coalition government that would include Shas, although it
also would prefer not to be in a coalition with Likud.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I prefer neither, but it is impossible to have Shas as
part of the government, although it will also be difficult to sit
down with Likud,'' said Ran Cohen, a Meretz member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The new Shinui Party, which has six seats and a platform that
opposes religious interference in personal matters, has also said
it cannot imagine governing in a coalition with Shas. The Russian
immigrant party, Yisrael B'Aliyah, with six seats, has only said it
does not want Shas to be in charge of the Interior Ministry.
Barak's other likely partner, the Center Party headed by former
Likud party member Yitzhak Mordechai, has six seats and does not
have a set position on Shas.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, whose One Israel alliance includes the Orthodox Meimad
faction, has not made it clear where he stands. Last week, Shas
overcame one obstacle when Aryeh Deri, convicted of bribery and
fraud, resigned as the party's political leader and from the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts and even members of Barak's own party
say it is important to include Shas in a coalition because many of
its supporters already feel alienated from the system and
discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   Shas has been in and out of governments since it was formed in
the early 1980s and, when in, it usually has managed to control the
Interior Ministry, giving the party good access to state funds for
its social programs and schools and helping it win new supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find much of what Shas stands for as unappealing but a true
politics of inclusion calls for understanding the root causes of
Shas' anger and frustration,'' wrote political scientist Shlomo
Avineri in the Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the black garb of the ultra-Orthodox Jews, he wrote,
``there exist real people who have real problems of poverty and
alienation, of identity and marginalization.''

STRAINS BETWEEN NRA AND FIREARMS MAKERS MAY HELP ADVOCATES OF GUN
CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of depending on the National Rifle
Association to carry their fight, many of the nation's largest gun
makers are breaking free of their powerful patron, supporting
limited gun-control measures they hope will ward off lawsuits and
more sweeping gun restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the opposition of NRA leaders, several top firearms
industry officials have in recent weeks attended a White House
meeting on violence, met with lawyers for cities that have sued gun
makers and endorsed Democratic gun-control proposals in Congress,
including requiring background checks of people who buy firearms at
gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The support of some big gun companies for several Democratic
proposals has weakened the NRA's political clout in Washington and
helped advocates of further restrictions win passage of the first
gun-control measures since the Republicans took control of Congress
in 1994. Tensions between some gun makers and the NRA could also
make it harder for the rifle association to defeat those measures
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Friction between the two groups is not new. Neither is the
industry entirely united, with some executives, particularly from
ammunition and rifle companies, continuing to support the NRA's
hardline stance against new gun restrictions. But the school
shootings in Littleton, Colo., last month have caused further
strains, particularly between the makers of handguns and the rifle
association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of different cross pressures pulling us
apart,'' said Robert A. Ricker, executive director of the American
Shooting Sports Council, a trade group representing 350 firearms
and ammunition manufacturers, including most of the nation's
largest gun companies. ``Littleton just drives the wedge deeper
between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many gun control advocates complain that the industry has yet to
support far-reaching firearms restrictions that might reduce their
profits. But they say that a breach between gun makers and the NRA
could make it easier to enact tougher gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of an opportunity,'' said Kristen Rand,
director of Federal policy for the Violence Policy Center, a
gun-control advocacy group. ``This split is going to continue to
widen.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the NRA, with its network of activists and brimming
campaign war chest, is a far more imposing lobbying presence in
Washington, support from major gun makers could provide political
cover for moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats looking
for reasons to vote for gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, Ricker has been telling wavering
Republicans and Democrats that his group supported several of
President Clinton's gun-control proposals, including mandatory
background checks of gun buyers at gun shows, raising the minimum
age for buying or possessing a handgun to 21 from 18 and expanding
a federal program to trace guns used in crimes. The gun show and
tracing measures passed in the Senate last week and are now before
the House.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats clearly see the value in isolating the NRA. Two weeks
ago, Clinton administration officials invited several gun industry
officials _ including Ricker and executives from Glock Inc., O.F.
Mossberg &AMP; Sons, the nation's largest shotgun maker, and Smith &AMP;
Wesson, the largest handgun manufacturer _ to the White House
summit on youth violence. But they did not invite top NRA
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the industry has stepped up to the plate and the
NRA doesn't seem too happy about it,'' said Bruce N. Reed,
President Clinton's chief domestic policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Rifle association officials acknowledge differences with some
gun makers, but blame Democrats for trying to inflame things.
``Some people are trying to divide us,'' said Robert L. Viden, an
NRA board member from New Jersey. ``There is more cooperation than
people realize.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, most gun makers had been willing to let the NRA
serve as their principal lobbyist and mouthpiece. But in the late
1980s, a number of smaller companies, concerned about legislative
efforts to restrict gun sales, formed the American Shooting Sports
Council to lobby for them in Washington. By the mid-1990s, most
major firearms companies had joined the council, and under its
executive director at the time, Richard T. Feldman, the group began
taking increasingly independent stands from the rifle association.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Feldman appeared at the White House to announce a
voluntary program by major handgun makers to include trigger locks
with new guns. The NRA denounced the agreement. But the shooting
council estimates that 80 percent of new guns sent to dealers now
include such locks.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the gun companies and NRA have also been
strained over their conflicting strategies for dealing with
lawsuits against the industry filed by shooting victims and cities.
Nine cities have filed suits, and many more are expected in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Under Feldman, the sports council began meeting with Mayor
Edward Rendell of Philadelphia, who has been considering filing a
suit, as well as with John Coale, a lawyer representing New Orleans
and four other cities that have sued.
</P>
<P>
   Though the industry is not willing to pay monetary settlements
to plaintiffs, its leaders say, many gun executives might endorse
certain gun control measures in exchange for having the cities drop
their suits. But the NRA adamantly opposes new restrictions on gun
owners, asserting that gun crimes could be prevented if existing
laws were simply enforced.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the NRA sought to reassert its influence over
the gun makers. It promised to use its power in state legislatures
to enact measures that would block cities from suing gun makers.
And it helped create an umbrella organization called the Hunting
and Shooting Sports Heritage Foundation that would help finance
litigation and a national public relations campaign for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The man placed in charge of the heritage foundation, Robert T.
Delfay, is also head of another trade group, the National Sports
Shooting Foundation, that remains close to the NRA. The National
Sports Shooting Foundation is heavily influenced by ammunition
makers and rifle companies that are less threatened by lawsuits
than the handgun makers that dominate the American Shooting Sports
Council.
</P>
<P>
   But in exchange for its assistance, NRA officials demanded in
February that the American Shooting Sports Council fire Feldman,
according to Feldman and other industry officials. NRA officials
deny forcing out Feldman, who was let go in March.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Feldman's ouster, relations between the sports council
and the NRA remained tense, and only got worse after the Littleton
shootings. Sensing that public opinion was turning strongly against
the industry, Ricker, who had replaced Feldman, began meeting with
White House aides about gun-control measures and reopened talks on
combating lawsuits with Rendell and Coale.
</P>
<P>
   Ricker said many members of his group no longer believe the NRA
can block lawsuits in certain major states, including California,
where as many as 16 cities are expected to file suits in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs of decay in the once formidable alliance.
Last week, the Hunting and Shooting Sports Heritage Foundation
suspended an advertising campaign intended to promote gun sports
like target shooting amid concerns that the ads would appear
insensitive in the wake of Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Feldman said that clashes between the
industry and the NRA will only get worse because the rifle
association's intransigence has made it ineffective, particularly
for gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways they prefer to lose, because losing is wonderful
for getting the troops activated, and for fund raising,'' Feldman
said of the current NRA leadership. ``The industry just wants to be
left alone to produce product and make money.''

FEDERAL WORKERS PROMISED GAINS IN MENTAL-HEALTH COVERAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration intends to require that
health insurance plans for federal employees provide comparable
coverage for severe mental illnesses and for physical ailments,
according to administration officials and Tipper Gore, who is
heading a White House conference on mental health next month.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, a longtime advocate for the rights of the mentally
ill, disclosed this month that she was treated for clinical
depression after her son was injured in an auto accident in 1989.
She said Monday that a goal of the White House conference was to
eliminate disparities in insurance coverage for mental and physical
illnesses _ to ``provide parity for all,'' while eliminating the
stigma of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   The new standards for health benefits for federal employees,
being drafted by the administration, are intended as an example for
employers across the country, federal officials said. The
administration has authority to act on federal employee benefits
under existing law, without congressional action.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new policy, health plans covering federal employees
and their families could not set more stringent limits on the
number of outpatient visits or days in the hospital for treatment
of mental disorders than for the treatment of physical illnesses
like heart disease or cancer. The policy would also bar higher
copayments for mental health care than for the treatment of
physical illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, who coordinates health policy at the White
House, said: ``The president believes that the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program should serve as a model for the rest of the
health care industry. Parity for federal health plans will not only
provide better access to needed mental health services, but also
illustrate that coverage of these services can be done
affordably.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said that details of the new policy were being worked
out with the Office of Personnel Management, which runs the health
insurance program for federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1996 law, group health plans are already forbidden to
set annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health care that are
lower than the limits for general medical and surgical services.
But insurers can get around the law by setting different limits on
the number of covered outpatient visits or hospital days, or by
charging different copayments and deductibles.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they expected to disclose details
of the new policy at the White House conference on mental health,
scheduled for June 7.
</P>
<P>
   The federal employees' health plan is the largest
employer-sponsored health insurance program in the United States.
It covers 9 million people through 285 private insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   The standards would not affect the health benefits provided by
private employers. Similar requirements for private employers have
been proposed by members of Congress from both parties, including
Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., and Rep.
Marge Roukema, R-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Mrs. Gore said that comparable coverage
for mental and physical disorders would have a very modest cost,
and she predicted that it would not be abused by people seeking
endless ``talk therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just too many people who saw Woody Allen movies
years ago,'' Mrs. Gore said. ``Lying on the couch forever and ever,
that's a stereotype, the Woody Allen syndrome. That's not what
we're talking about. It's another myth to bust. Most people with
mental illness are not out to rip off the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Mrs. Gore said: ``A number of companies are already
providing parity, and it's costing about 25 cents a day, at the
most. That is much less than the people who have been afraid to
provide mental health coverage were predicting.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five cents a day represents an increase of $91 a year, or
3 percent of the $3,000 spent by a typical employer on health
benefits for an employee.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, employers, insurers and health maintenance
organizations have found ways to provide mental health services at
predictable costs. In many cases, they hire specialized
managed-care companies to monitor the work of psychiatrists,
psychologists and other mental health professionals, to make sure
patients receive appropriate and effective treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists often resent such second-guessing. But Dr. Jerome
Vaccaro, medical director of Pacificare Behavioral Health, in Van
Nuys, Calif., said the work of these companies often led to better
outcomes for patients.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996 law took effect, some insurance companies and
group health plans simply replaced the old dollar limits on mental
health care with numerical limits on outpatient visits, treatment
sessions or days in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day and visit limits wind up being more restrictive in
some cases than the dollar limits for which they substituted,''
said Ronald Bachman, an actuary at the accounting firm of
PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore said she favored full equivalence, or parity, in
coverage for ``the recognized major mental health disorders.''
Those conditions, she said, include schizophrenia, bipolar
(manic-depressive) disorder and major or clinical depression.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Personnel Management is seriously considering a
broader policy that would require parity for many other mental
disorders as well, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 19 states, including Connecticut, have laws that
require the same or similar levels of coverage for mental and
physical illnesses. A study by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services found that the state laws had had ``a small effect
on premiums.''

BELL ATLANTIC FILES LONG-DISTANCE PLAN FOR BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Bell Atlantic filed its Monday application to start
selling long-distance service in Massachusetts early next year,
touching off a high-stakes debate about whether the company has
done enough to open its local phone market to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like MediaOne, RCN, AT&AMP;T, and MCI-WorldCom said they
would fight Bell Atlantic's long-distance proposal. They said the
company hasn't cracked open its local phone network, a regulatory
bar the company has to clear if it wants to break into the
long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators at the state Department of Telecommunications and
Energy reacted cautiously Monday to Bell Atlantic's 15,000-page
filing, which was delivered in 28 boxes. They declined to say how
they would proceed, other than to say that Bell Atlantic's claims
would be scrutinized closely. Approval of the Federal
Communications Commission also is required.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is the second market where New York-based Bell
Atlantic has sought permission to offer long-distance services. The
company filed its first application last year in New York, and
another is expected shortly in Pennsylvania. Analysts say none of
the other six regional phone companies across the country is as far
along as Bell Atlantic in the regulatory process.
</P>
<P>
   Long distance is the key missing ingredient in the efforts of
Bell Atlantic and the other regional phone companies to offer
customers a rich stew of telecommunications services on one bill.
But the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 authorizes state and
federal regulators to treat the $80 billion long-distance market
like a carrot, withholding it from the regional phone companies
until they open their markets to competition.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bell Atlantic officials were vague about what consumer
benefits they would bring to the already-crowded long-distance
market, they were insistent that they had met or exceeded all of
the 14 items on the local-competition checklist established by
Congress in the Telecommunications Act.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said 98 companies are now vying to provide local
phone service in Massachusetts and consumers can easily switch
carriers and keep their existing phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any company that says it can't compete with us simply doesn't
wish to do so,'' said Wayne Budd, Bell Atlantic's group vice
president for New England.
</P>
<P>
   But companies that are actually trying to compete against Bell
Atlantic say dealing with Bell Atlantic is not easy, with customers
all too often losing their dial tone as a customer is transferred
from Bell Atlantic to a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   RCN and MediaOne, the two companies vying for residential local
telephone customers in Massachusetts, said they have experienced a
host of problems in connecting their networks with Bell Atlantic's.
MediaOne, in fact, reached an impasse with Bell Atlantic on several
issues last month, and both companies have asked the DTE to step in
and arbitrate.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Jenkinson, MediaOne's spokesman, said Bell Atlantic's
market is open only on paper. ``It's nice to have interconnection
agreements signed, but the experience of the one facilities-based
company competing against Bell Atlantic in the residential market
is that they have not proven themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its dealings with Bell Atlantic, Mike Mahoney, president and
chief operating officer of RCN, said his company has experienced
billing problems, delays in gaining access to Bell Atlantic
telephone poles, and difficulties in transferring a customer
numbers from Bell Atlantic to RCN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to determine whether these things are
happening because of incompetence or sabotage, but the end result
is the same,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic officials said the regulatory process in
Massachusetts should proceed smoothly because the company has gone
through a rigorous review in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Public Service Commission hired an outside
consulting firm to test Bell Atlantic's computer systems to see
whether they mesh easily with those of competitors. Bell Atlantic
passed 90 percent of the tests, but is still working to pass the
others.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic officials said most of the same systems deployed
in New York are also in use here, which means regulators here could
easily piggyback on the New York review.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and MCI-WorldCom both said the lack of local phone
competition in Massachusetts is proof enough that Bell Atlantic has
not opened up its market sufficiently.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bell Atlantic's filing, less than 30,000 customers
have had their numbers ``ported'' to a competitor, while 138,000
lines have been purchased for resale. Most of Bell Atlantic's
competitors target the business market because that's where the
biggest profits are. Bell Atlantic officials said Monday they did
not know how many residential customers have defected to a
competitor. The company serves a total of four million business and
residential customers in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Atlantic has 99 percent market share in Massachusetts.
That is not evidence of competition by any definition,'' said
Robert Lopardo, regional director for public policy at
MCI-WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   But Budd said Bell Atlantic doesn't have to show that
competitors control a certain percentage of the Massachusetts
market. It only has to demonstrate that the market is open to
competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic shares rose 1/16 Monday on the New York Stock
Exchange to close at 55 9/16.

TIMES CO. CONSOLIDATES ITS INTERNET UNITS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Times Co. said Monday it would
consolidate its numerous Internet properties into one division.
</P>
<P>
   The new unit, Times Company Digital, will include nearly 50
World Wide Web sites from the company's newspaper, magazine and
broadcast groups. Among the most popular are nytimes.com, the Web
site of The New York Times, and boston.com, the nation's largest
regional site.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Company Web sites have previously operated under
several divisions. The new structure will establish the division as
a separate operating unit reporting directly to the chairman and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Times Company Digital is part of a growing trend
among newspaper corporations to publicize their Internet holdings.
The Tribune Co., which publishes The Chicago Tribune, said last
week that it would create an interactive unit.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being more efficient to manage, these Internet
divisions make it easier for investors to spot a newspaper's
dominance in cyberspace. In the last several months, investors have
flocked to Internet stocks. By advertising their Internet holdings,
newspaper companies are hoping to raise their market values.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper companies are also strong Internet players. The Times
Co. said Monday it expected its new-media properties to generate
$24 million to $26 million in revenue this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for The New York Times and all newspaper
companies to have an Internet division,'' said Michael A. Kupinski,
an analyst at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. ``Three years ago, the
Times executives were beating themselves up because their stock
valuation was not as high as The Tribune's. What The Tribune had
done exceedingly well was to promote its multimedia businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Times Co. dropped 31.25 cents, to $34.75, on the
New York Stock Exchange Monday.

   EXCERPTS FROM SUPREME COURT CASE RULING ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN
SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, joined by
Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
Stephen Breyer:
</P>
<P>
   ``We stress that our conclusion ere . . . does not mean that
(school boards) can avoid liability only by purging their schools
of actionable peer harassment or that administrators must engage in
particular disciplinary action. We disagree with (the school
board's) contention that, if Title IX provides a cause of action
for student-on-student sexual harassment, 'nothing short of
expulsion of every student accused of misconduct involving sexual
overtones would protect school systems from liability or damages.'
. . . In fact, as we have previously noted, courts should refrain
from second-guessing the disciplinary decisions made by school
administrators. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the dissent, we acknowledge that school administrators
shoulder substantial burdens as a result of legal constraints on
their disciplinary authority. To the extent that these restrictions
arise from federal statutes, Congress can review these burdens with
attention to the difficult position in which such legislation may
place our nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe, however, that the standard set out here is
sufficiently flexible to account both for the level of disciplinary
authority available to the school and for the potential liability
arising from certain forms of disciplinary action. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``While it remains to be seen whether (Aurelia Davis) can show
that the board's response to reports of G.F.'s misconduct was
clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances, (she) may
be able to show that the board 'subjected' LaShonda to
discrimination by failing to respond in any way over a period of
five months to complaints of G.F.'s in-school misconduct from
LaShonda and other female students.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing in dissent, joined by Chief
Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas:
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority's opinion purports to be narrow, but the limiting
principles it proposes are illusory. The fence the court has built
is made of little sticks, and it cannot contain the avalanche of
liability now set in motion. The potential costs to our schools of
today's decision are difficult to estimate, but they are so great
that it is most unlikely Congress intended to inflict them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only certainty flowing from the majority's decision is
that scarce resources will be diverted from educating our children
and that many school districts, desperate to avoid Title IX peer
harassment suits, will adopt whatever federal code of student
conduct and discipline the Department of Education sees fit to
impose upon them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's schoolchildren will learn their first lessons
about federalism in classrooms where the federal government is the
ever-present regulator. The federal government will have insinuated
itself not only into one of the most traditional areas of state
concern but also into one of the most sensitive areas of human
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal control of the discipline of our nation's
schoolchildren is contrary to our traditions and inconsistent with
the sensible administration of our schools. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority seems oblivious to the fact that almost every
child, at some point, has trouble in school because he or she is
being teased by his or her peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most children respond to teasing in ways that detract from
their ability to learn. The majority's test for actionable
harassment will, as a result, sweep in almost all of the more
innocuous conduct it acknowledges as a ubiquitous part of school
life.''

63 TEACHERS ACCEPT SIGNING BONUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When Lois Hedberg was diagnosed with breast cancer
five years ago, she used her education to research the disease, ask
doctors informed questions, connect with other patients and write
about it in a journal as therapy.
</P>
<P>
   What struck the church secretary as she went through
chemotherapy treatments and recovered from a mastectomy was how
much more excruciating the illness was for people less literate,
not as well-schooled.
</P>
<P>
   And so, her cancer acted as a muse, guiding her to teaching as a
new vocation so she could help others help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Hedberg, 53, was one step closer to the classroom as she
_ and 62 other new Massachusetts teachers _ accepted a $20,000
signing bonus from Senate President Tom Birmingham and state
Department of Education Commissioner David P. Driscoll.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made me want to teach was seeing people with this disease
who were poor and could not read and did not know what they were
dealing with,'' said Hedberg, of Wilbraham. ``I thought, `I want to
be the one to say, `You can do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A former college English teacher who has a master's degree from
Cornell and is a longtime school volunteer, Hedberg represents 41
percent of the recipients who are mid-career professionals between
the ages of 30 and 60.
</P>
<P>
   At a State House press conference Monday, Birmingham called the
recipients diverse and impressive and noted the bonuses were a way
for the state to lure people who had been flirting with education
as a career _ but hesitated because of the $26,000 starting salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should go into teaching to get rich,'' said Birmingham,
who devised the bonus program. ``But you shouldn't have to be rich
to afford to be a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would support an increase in the $60 million Teacher
Quality budget item that supplied the funds this year, to help
entice more teachers next year. The bonuses will be given out in
four annual payments, the first is $8,000, to be used at the
teacher's discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll called the bonus program ``a tremendous success story''
built on Birmingham's vision, and serving to uplift education at a
time when ``things looked fairly bleak.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is the only state offering bonuses in its teacher
recruitment campaign. To spread the word, DOE officials visited
cities and college campuses nationwide last year.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 responses flooded into the DOE; 800 applications
were accepted. Of those, 120 finalists were selected based on class
rank (top 10 percent or better), grade-point averages (a minimum of
3.5), writing samples, recommendations and, for mid-career
professionals, work experience.
</P>
<P>
   All had to pass the state-mandated Educator Certification Test,
present a sample teaching lesson and interview one-on-one. The 62
chosen recipients agreed to teach in urban schools and will be
teaching in summer schools to prepare for their classroom debuts in
the fall. The new teachers also will be matched up with veteran
teacher-mentors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching is not something you learn totally, you have to bring
something deep down inside you to the profession; you must be
called to it,'' said Taiwo Stephenson, 31, a former biological
researcher at Harvard University Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson left a potential career in medicine in 1995 to
substitute-teach at Lowell High School, and now will begin his more
formal teaching career. ``You must enjoy children and love people
and bring that to the classroom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus recipients come from 10 states nationwide and one
foreign country, Romania. They have attended Ivy League colleges,
state universities and technical schools and have graduate degrees
in education, law, and civil engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The mid-career professionals have worked in business, research,
journalism and public health, among other professions. Forty-four
percent of the recipients are men, 56 percent are women, 23 percent
are minorities and 48 percent have strong backgrounds in math and
science, areas that need bolstering in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of bonus recipients, however, are soon-to-be
college graduates, like 22-year-old William Triant of Wellesley,
who will graduate June 10 from Harvard College with a 3.75 GPA and
a degree in American history and literature.
</P>
<P>
   Triant, who will teach physics and chemistry at a Boston public
high school, said he was inspired by instructors at Roxbury Latin
High School, who ``didn't just teach me things, but taught me how
to be myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about encourging kids to have their own thoughts
and expressions,'' Triant said. ``I know it will be a little
strange to have such a young teacher in front of them, but I think
I will bring a lot of energy into the classroom.''

 &HT;    Passed-over Oliver sues Auburn
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ In these parts, where life tends to revolve
around little more than college football, Bill Oliver has been
labeled a defensive guru by Auburn and Alabama fans, alike. The
faithful know him not just as coach Oliver but as ``Brother''
Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   And now, they can call him by another title _ plaintiff in a
potentially nasty court tussle that might expose Auburn's dirty
laundry for public airing.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver filed a civil lawsuit Monday in Lee County Circuit Court,
citing Auburn athletics director David Housel, influential
university trustee Robert E. ``Bobby'' Lowder and the university
itself. The eight counts include breach of contract, fraud and
deceit.
</P>
<P>
   A who's who of college football coaches and administrators could
parade across the Plains for depositions by summer's end, from
ex-Auburn coach Terry Bowden to Florida coach Steve Spurrier.
Auburn previously drew criticism for its handling of the Bowden
situation and for later backing out of a contract to play Florida
State, coached by Terry Bowden's father, Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the Oliver case is his contention that Housel
promised him the position of head coach, as a condition for
replacing Bowden on an interim basis last October. Oliver's
attorney, Kenneth Ingram Jr. of Alexander City, said Monday that
Oliver was later ```blindsided'' upon learning the job was offered
to former Mississippi coach Tommy Tuberville.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, assuming that he had the job, turned down an offer to
serve as Spurrier's defensive coordinator, Ingram said.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Housel led him to believe he would be the next head
coach,'' Ingram said. ``He assured him of it. . . . It was things
like: `You're the man. You're gonna get it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There was never a written agreement, however.
</P>
<P>
   As early as the summer of 1997, Ingram said, Lowder widely cast
as the man behind the hiring and firing of Auburn coaches
approached Oliver about the replacement of Bowden. Oliver had
joined Bowden's staff as defensive coordinator in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Lowder said, `Brother, I'm not pleased with Terry Bowden
as our head coach,' '' Ingram said. `` 'I want you to be ready to
step in at anytime. In fact, that may happpen before this season
even starts.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lowder, founder of Colonial Bank in Montgomery and chairman of a
$9.5 billion holding company, could not be reached for comment
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Housel referred inquiries to university attorney Lee Armstrong,
whose office declined comment. Likewise, Ingram has advised Oliver
not to discuss the lawsuit. Oliver was out of state Monday to
prepare for the birth of a grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   During a 30-minute news conference Monday, Ingram, dressed in a
dark blue suit, charged that the university should be run by its
board of trustees, not by one man ``who obviously has anointed
himself as some monarch over what he considers to be his kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingram said Auburn is named in the suit only as a means to
recover more than $100,000 in principal that Oliver owes on a loan
he took out when he was hired in 1996. The suit seeks unspecified
damages, but Ingram said his firm will donate any fees it earns to
the university's general scholarship fund. Terry Bowden has been
identified as the first to give a deposition, here beginning next
month. Oliver's attorneys are expected to make Bowden a key witness
in its argument that Housel, as the university's representative,
had agreed that Auburn would pay off a loan of $136,000 over five
years that the coach took upon being hired as defensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition for coming to Auburn, Oliver had asked Housel to
add the almost nine years in pension monies that he had accumulated
in out-of-state coaching jobs into the Alabama State Retirement
Fund. Instead, the suit alleges, Housel encouraged Oliver to take
out a loan for the amount with Colonial Bank and promised that the
athletic department would cover the principal and interest with
five annual payments to Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   The verbal agreement was reached in a meeting attended by Oliver
and his attorney, Ricky Davis, Bowden and Housel. According to
Ingram, the university made only partial payments. and Oliver still
owes more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Housel told everyone in that room, and I believe they'll
testify to it,'' Ingram said, ``that he had run this by Bobby
Lowder and (that) Bobby Lowder had agreed to it . . . I want
damages for what this man has been put through.

NEW YORK AND LONDON LAW FIRMS PROPOSE FIRST OVERSEAS MERGER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Senior lawyers at Rogers &AMP; Wells in New York and
Clifford Chance in London have voted to join forces in what would
be the first overseas merger of large law firms.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger, which would create the world's
second-largest law firm in terms of revenue, must still be voted on
by all partners at the two firms, said a lawyer involved in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the union could touch off a flurry of mergers
between law firms in the United States and Britain, which are
scrambling to expand their global reach to better serve
multinational clients. The law firms also feel threatened by the
giant accounting firms, which have jumped into the legal business
by hiring thousands of lawyers and merging with whole law firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undoubtedly, there will be more of these mergers,'' said Joel
F. Henning, senior vice president at Hildebrandt International, a
consulting firm that advises law firms. ``In a world where
Daimler-Benz merges with Chrysler, where European banks are
acquiring American banks and where BP acquires Amoco, it would be
peculiar if the major law firms advising those companies were not
looking to grow correspondingly.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger would mean the end of the New York institution known
as Rogers &AMP; Wells, which has roots that date back 128 years. The
firm's partners include William P. Rogers, 85, who served as
secretary of state in the Nixon administration and attorney general
in the Eisenhower administration.
</P>
<P>
   With 400 lawyers, Rogers &AMP; Wells would be dwarfed by its
potential mate. Clifford Chance, with 2,000 lawyers, is Britain's
largest law firm.
</P>
<P>
   The new law firm would be known as Clifford Chance Rogers &AMP;
Wells in the United States, the lawyer said, and as Clifford Chance
in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But for the 400 lawyers at Rogers &AMP; Wells, a marriage with the
British giant brings global opportunities. Clifford Chance has
offices in 26 cities worldwide and has been aggressively expanding
its practice, intending to be the world's largest law firm.
</P>
<P>
   The British firm has long had its eye on large law firms based
in Manhattan. By joining Rogers &AMP; Wells, Clifford Chance gains
access to Wall Street and its booming market of corporate financial
deals. The lucrative legal fees associated with those deals are
helping New York's top law firms earn record profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to be a good match-up,'' Henning said. ``But no
merger is easy.''
</P>
<P>
   And, for this union to work, the two law firms must adapt to
each other's culture. Most significantly, the partners must agree
on how to split their profits.
</P>
<P>
   At Rogers &AMP; Wells, like most American law firms, partners'
salaries are based largely on what lawyers call the ``eat what you
kill'' approach: Those who bring in more clients and bill more
hours get paid more than those who do not. But at Clifford Chance
and most other British law firms, partners get paid based on their
seniority and the number of years they have worked for the firm, in
a system known as ``lockstep.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer who has been involved in the talks says that the
two firms' leaders think they can work through the compensation
issues because the average partner at each firm earns the same,
about $650,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The partners must also work through some client conflicts that
would be created by a merger. In one case, the law firms represent
clients on both sides of a lawsuit that is scheduled for trial
soon, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The partners at the two firms are expected to vote on the merger
by the end of June. If approved, it would be effective on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by The American Lawyer magazine, Rogers &AMP;
Wells, which had gross revenue of $187.5 million in 1997, was
America's 43rd-largest law firm. According to a similar survey of
global firms in 1998, Clifford Chance was the world's third-largest
law firm with $629 million in revenue. Only New York's Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, with $826 million in revenue, and
Baker &AMP; McKenzie in Chicago, with $696.5 million, were larger.
</P>
<P>
   But even those law firms are small compared with the five
largest accounting firms. The Big Five are years ahead of the law
firms in creating global practices that offer ``one-stop shopping''
in a myriad of services to their corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting firms are already practicing law in many European
countries but have been limited in the United States by laws that
prevent lawyers and accountants from sharing fees. A committee at
the American Bar Association is reviewing those rules and
considering changes that may make it easier for the accounting
firms to practice law and the law firms to hire accountants and
consultants.

   Sergei Khrushchev, whose father Nikita Khrushchev ruled the
Soviet Union and its Communist Party during the pinnacle of Cold
War tensions with the United States, will become a naturalized
American citizen next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about this decision and I had the freedom to make
this decision,'' Khrushchev said in a telephone interview Monday
from his home in Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been living here for seven years and working for Brown
University and I am planning to live here longer. If I am living in
the country, I think I have the obligation to be a citizen, not a
foreigner who came for temporary residence.''
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev's Seattle-based immigration lawyer, Dan P. Danilov,
said Khrushchev and his wife, Valentina Golenko, are scheduled to
become citizens June 23 at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service regional headquarters in St. Albens, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev, 63, a senior research scholar and lecturer at Brown
University's Center for Foreign Policy Development, is a rocket
engineer and computer scientist who once headed the Soviet Missile
Design Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   He received his ``green card,'' granting him permanent resident
status, in 1993 with the support of former Presidents Nixon and
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He has published several books about his father, who ruled the
Soviet Union from 1953 until he was deposed in 1964, and about the
Cold War that kept the world under threat of nuclear conflict.
Nikita Khrushchev died in virtual isolation on Sept. 11, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important for everyone to understand that many
of the mistakes made during the Cold War that led to dangerous
conflicts were based on misconceptions and misunderstandings of the
way of thinking of the other side,'' Khrushchev said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even today, the White House did not think Yugoslavia would
resist after NATO began bombing. When you see the whole picture of
how and why leaders make the decisions that they do, you create a
greater chance for resolving conflict and achieving peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev has just published in Russia the four-volume memoirs
of his father. He and Pennsylvania State University Press hope to
have an English-language version published here. Khrushchev's own
book on the history of the Cold War and post-Soviet Russia is to be
published next month.
</P>
<P>
   Nikita Khrushchev once told Americans, ``We will bury you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This comment was among the things that were misunderstood and
it shows how dangerous this type of misunderstanding can be,''
Sergei Khrushchev said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, he was refering to a socialist centralized
economic system, which he believed would prevail and be more
effective than a free market system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the unfortunate phrasing, it was understood
incorrectly to mean a threat to the safety of the people of the
United States. He never wanted to bury anybody, but he believed in
a Soviet centralized economy. In the end, a free-market system
prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev's immigration lawyer, Dan Danilov, said Khrushchev's
main hesitancy in applying for U.S. citizenship had been a concern
over what his father would think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that Papa will never know about it,'' said Danilov.

SABERHAGEN GETS A CHANCE TO WORK OUT ARM IN AKRON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rain will keep the Red Sox in New York for one night
longer than they expected, as Monday's postponement was rescheduled
for Thursday night, giving Roger Clemens an extra day's rest before
he faces his former mates for the first time in pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   There's one Sox player who won't be sticking around for the
occasion: Bret Saberhagen, who won his first Cy Young Award one
year (1985) before Clemens won his, intends to be in Akron, Ohio,
where he is scheduled to pitch Thursday for Class AA Trenton
against the Aeros, minor-league affiliate of the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen is on what he hopes will be a short rehabilitation
assignment before he rejoins the Sox rotation. It is six weeks
since he won a game for the Red Sox, five weeks since he pitched as
many as six innings, and three weeks since he was stashed on the
disabled list, done in by a strained muscle in the back of a
reconstructed right shoulder that held up remarkably well last
season.
</P>
<P>
   If he is able to throw around 70 pitches, Saberhagen said, he
expects to be able to rejoin the Sox rotation by the following
week. If not, the muscle strain threatens to make hash of what had
been a remarkable comeback story.
</P>
<P>
   A story known well to David Cone, the Yankees' righthander who
not only counts Saberhagen among his closest friends in the game,
but scripted his own storybook comeback from an aneurysm in his
pitching shoulder two years ago, winning 20 games at age 35, a
decade after he'd won 20 games for the Mets in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one pulls for him as much as I do,'' Cone said in the
Yankees' clubhouse. ``He's been to hell and back with his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough. He'll come back. But it's disappointing to see him
struggle with it.''
</P>
<P>
   At 35, Saberhagen is 15 months younger than Cone, with whom he
first became friends as prospects in the Royals' system before
being reunited with the Mets in 1992. It's regrettable, Cone said,
but inevitable that for as long as Saberhagen continues to pitch,
he'll have worries about his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The type of surgery he had was so (radical), he'll have to be
careful the rest of his career,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Red Sox) did a great job of handling him last
season. Jimy (Williams) handled him as well as I've ever seen an
injured pitcher handled.''
</P>
<P>
   What many fail to realize, Cone said, is the toll extracted from
Saberhagen each time he pushes himself to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you pick up a baseball and throw, you've got to
work through the pain,'' Cone said. ``The pain wears you down. The
pain itself is fatiguing. I know that every time I threw, it would
take me 15 minutes to get loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant fight, dealing with the pain. And it's a
different type of pain, a very sharp, deep type of pain when you
have a shoulder operation. And the meter's still running. It's not
one of those things when you wake up one morning and it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   So, why not concede the fight, count up your big-league wins
(157), your all-star appearances (three), your Cy Young Awards
(two), your World Series ring and Series MVP, and spend the rest of
your afternoons on a golf course someplace warm?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to walk away when there's still a chance you can do
it,'' Cone said. ``He's still a great pitcher. He can still pitch
with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great tandem they have, Pedro (Martinez) and Sabes
when he is right. Sabes has a feel for pitching; you saw what he
did last year. He used to have the best fastball in the American
League, he and Roger. He doesn't throw 95 anymore, but he can still
throw hard, and he doesn't have to throw 95 to be successful,
because he knows how to pitch and change speeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night in Canal Park in Akron, far from Yankee Stadium
in the Bronx, Saberhagen will ignore the pain one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipate he'll be back,'' Cone said. ``He knows what he
needs to do.''

BOMBARDIER GETS NEW YORK ORDER

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York
has ordered 192 electric rail cars from Bombardier Inc. to replace
commuter trains on the Long Island Rail Road, the company announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The initial contract is worth $445 million, but if options for
808 additional cars are exercised the total price for 1,000 cars
would be $1.85 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier, a Montreal-based company that has become a global
leader in mass-transit equipment, will build stainless steel bodies
for the trains at La Pocatiere, Quebec, and install the drive
systems and interior fixtures at its United States plant in
Plattsburg, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The contract requires that at least 30 percent of the value of
the work be done in New York, said Kim Fischer, a Bombardier
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Electric of Japan and Supersteel of New York have a
joint-venture company that will make the electric drive systems.
</P>
<P>
   Deliveries to the LIRR are to begin in the second quarter of
2002 and continue for a year. If additional cars are ordered, some
will go into service on the Metro North Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Founded as a maker of snow-moving equipment in 1942, the main
business of Bombardier, has evolved into the construction of subway
cars, trains, airplanes and other motorized vehicles to a broad
range of international clients that range from the New York City
subway system to Shandong Province in China. The company's $8
billion in annual business has been growing at a rate of 20 percent
a year.

 DIVIDED SUPREME COURT HOLDS SCHOOLS LIABLE FOR SEX HARASSMENT BY
STUDENTS  (rm) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ School districts can be liable for damages under
federal law for failing to stop a student from subjecting another
student to severe and pervasive sexual harassment, the Supreme
Court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-to-4 decision, with a majority opinion by Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor, found the court bitterly divided over the role of
federal law in the public school classroom. The ruling opened
school districts to liability for sexual harassment by students on
essentially the same grounds that a Supreme Court decision a year
ago set for liability when teachers harass students.
</P>
<P>
   What O'Connor, the author of both decisions, described Monday as
a statutory weapon against sex discrimination so severe that it
impairs a victim's ability to learn was labeled in Justice Anthony
M. Kennedy's dissenting opinion as an unwarranted federal intrusion
into ``day-to-day classroom logistics and interactions,'' a
judicial overreaction to ``the routine problems of adolescence.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens,
David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. Chief
Justice William Rehnquist joined Kennedy's dissent, along with
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually direct rejoinder from the bench, O'Connor
concluded her announcement of the decision by addressing the
dissenters who, she said, maintained that the ruling would ``teach
little Johnny a perverse lesson in federalism.'' Rather, she said,
the majority believed the decision ``assures that little Mary may
attend class.''
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion, O'Connor emphasized that ``damages are not
available for simple acts of teasing and name-calling among school
children'' but rather for behavior ``so severe, pervasive, and
objectively offensive that it denies its victims the equal access
to education'' guaranteed under Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972. School officials must have known of the
harassment and, acting with ``deliberate indifference,'' failed to
take reasonable steps to stop it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving a dispute among the lower federal courts, the decision
overturned a ruling last year by the federal appeals court in
Atlanta that Title IX, which bars sex discrimination in schools and
colleges that receive federal money, simply did not apply to
student-on-student harassment. The case will now go back to the
appeals court for an application of the test the court set Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The case was brought by the mother of a girl who, as a
fifth-grader in Forsyth, Ga., complained that she was subjected to
months of sexual advances, taunting and unwanted touching of her
breasts and genital area by a boy who was eventually charged and
convicted in juvenile court of sexual battery against her. The girl
said, among other complaints, that the boy put a door stop in his
pants and acted in a sexually suggestive manner toward her in a gym
class.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and school administrators refused to respond to
complaints brought by the mother, Aurelia Davis, and by her
daughter, LaShonda, who sat next the boy in class and kept begging
to have her seat changed. Unable to concentrate in school,
LaShonda's grades dropped and she wrote a suicide note. The suit
seeks $500,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   While the court did not reach a conclusion on the Monroe County
Board of Education's liability, O'Connor's graphic recitation of
the details of the harassing behavior made clear that the school
district does not face an easy task in the next phase of the case.
O'Connor emphasized that schools exercise significant control over
student discipline, particularly in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly, in light of the vehemence of Kennedy's
dissent, the National School Boards Association was supportive of
the decision. ``The standard has been set so high that it's a
standard we can live with and in fact are living up to already,''
Julie Underwood, the association's general counsel, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the situation the court was addressing was, in a
sense, ``anachronistic'' because in the six years since this
lawsuit was filed, ``school districts have really worked hard to
have policies against sexual harassment and to help children
understand sexual harassment.'' Monroe County had no formal policy
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law
Center, which represented the Davis family, said she was satisfied
with the decision as well. She said the court had drawn ``a line
that makes sense,'' adding that the decision ``puts
student-on-student harassment on a proper footing with the rest of
Title IX.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's dissenting opinion, at 34 pages half again as long as
the majority opinion, took issue with the majority's premise that
``sex discrimination'' or ``sexual harassment'' was the proper way
to describe what he called at various points ``immature, childish
behavior'' and ``inappropriate behavior by children who are just
learning to interact with their peers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the workplace context as well as, more recently, in the
schools, the cCourt's precedents have treated sexual harassment as
a form of sex discrimination. But Kennedy said the court now had
taken that analysis too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The norms of the adult workplace that have defined hostile
environment sexual harassment are not easily translated to peer
relationships in schools,'' he said, ``where teen-age romantic
relationships and dating are a part of everyday life.'' He added,
``a teen-ager's romantic overtures to a classmate (even when
persistent and unwelcome) are an inescapable part of adolescence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that while the majority described its test as
narrow and limiting, it was ``in fact, so broad that it will
support untold numbers of lawyers'' and lead courts and juries ``to
second-guess school administrators in every case.'' The result, he
said, would be ``a climate of fear that encourages school
administrators to label even the most innocuous of childish conduct
sexual harassment.'' He cited recent incidents in which schools had
suspended young children for kissing classmates of the opposite
sex.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor replied with a warning of her own. ``We trust that the
dissent's characterization of our opinion will not mislead courts
to impose more sweeping liability than we read Title IX to
require,'' she said, adding that to meet the court's test, the
behavior would ordinarily have to have a ``systemic effect'' rather
than reflect a single incident.
</P>
<P>
   But it was on the ground of federalism that the real battle in
this case, Davis vs. Monroe County Board of Education, No. 97-843,
appeared to have been fought.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said, ``Perhaps the most grave, and surely the most
lasting, disservice of Monday's decision is that it insures the
court's own disregard for the federal balance soon will be imparted
to our youngest citizens.'' He continued, ``Federal influence will
permeate everything from curriculum decisions to day-to-day
classroom logistics and interactions.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, until now, had been a reliable ally on the states'
rights side virtually any time a case raising federalism issues was
before the court. In the teacher harassment case last year, Gebser
vs. Lago Vista Independent School District, it was O'Connor and
Monday's dissenters who formed the 5-to-4 majority that set a high
hurdle for students to meet in suing school districts for
harassment by teachers; the four more liberal justices who joined
the majority Monday complained then that the test was too strict.

HURTING EWING KEEPS HOPING FOR THAT CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fourteen years removed from his Georgetown days and
five years removed from his only appearance in the NBA Finals (a
painful coulda/shoulda/woulda seven-game loss after being up, three
games to two), Patrick Ewing labors mightily for the New York
Knicks these days.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a pretty sight.
</P>
<P>
   It is now a cliche to label him a ``warrior.'' You'd think it
was on his birth certificate. But let's not go there. Just call him
a proud professional who wants desperately to win a championship,
and who hopes he doesn't get in the way while healthier and younger
men (Herb Williams excepted) bring more tangible assets to the
table.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks won Sunday's third game against Atlanta with their
captain making a minimal contribution. He had two baskets in 12
attempts. He never went to the line. He had no assists. He did grab
seven rebounds, and that often is his major contribution. He
blocked no shots. He only played 24 minutes, and it is almost a
given that his team would have won had he not played at all. His
backup, Chris Dudley, put up playoff career highs of 14 points and
12 rebounds and he, not the aging All-Star center, got a standing O
when he fouled out with 1:06 left.
</P>
<P>
   There have been much better times to be Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all this is known to everyone who cares. It's not
simply a case of him being less than three months shy of his 37th
birthday. Or maybe it is. The reason he looks 136, and not merely
36, is that he is injured. Or is the reason he is injured because
he is a worn-out 36? We may not know the answer until next season,
when the Knicks are obligated to pay this man in excess of $14
million.
</P>
<P>
   He's got the textbook bad knees, but what 36-year-old center
doesn't? All that asphalt pounding as a youth and all that running
up and down the floor _ and, oh, how Patrick Ewing could run _
takes an inevitable toll. Now he also has a damaged left Achilles'
tendon. His best friend, more often than not, is a bucket of ice.
</P>
<P>
   He is probably too heavy, if you want to get right down to it.
He never was able to get in shape, at least not the kind of shape
he is accustomed to. He is now paying a fearful price for his
countless hours as a Players Association leader. Time that would
ordinarily have been spent working out was given over to hours
logged in a suit plotting the future of his fellow players. And in
the end he was discarded, as a deal many believe to be harmful to
the players was cut. He was not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Time really does fly by, doesn't it? We are, after all, talking
about our Patrick Ewing, arguably the best Greater Boston high
school product ever. This is the Patrick Ewing of Cambridge Rindge
&AMP; Latin, who emigrated from Jamaica at age 11 and who grew up to be
the leader of multiple state champions. He took his services to
Georgetown, where he played in three NCAA title games in four years
and where he won a championship in 1984, when he and Michael Graham
terrorized Sam Bowie and Mel Turpin in an unforgettable semifinal
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   He was an extraordinarily shy young man who was not comfortable
outside his circle of close friends, but who was said to be a
delightful companion to those he knew best. The rest of us couldn't
see it then, but we can see it now. He is a poised man, entirely
sure of himself. He has a killer smile. He can be as elusive as the
next guy when it comes to granting interviews, but when he is in
the mood he is charming, engaging, and informative. As an adult, he
has always been good for a few surprises. I mean, who would have
thought that the No. 1, guaranteed, mortal lock, go-to-dinner
companions on the dream team would have been Larry Bird and Patrick
Ewing, or, as they were known for those seven weeks, ``Harry and
Larry?''
</P>
<P>
   Molded by Mike Jarvis to be a facsimile Bill Russell, and
further trained by John Thompson to treat offense as an
afterthought, he has turned out to be one of the great offensive
centers of all-time. When the short list of Most Reliable Moves of
all-time is compiled, sure to be included is Patrick Ewing's
patented baseline turnaround jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Relying primarily on that shot, Ewing averaged between 20 and
28.6 points a game for his first 13 NBA seasons. After missing 51
games in his first two seasons because of injury he became a
classic clock-punching machine, missing but 20 games over the next
10 seasons before missing the final 56 games of the 1997-98 season
with a freak wrist injury that could have happened to some
21-year-old kid as easily as to a 13-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   But an assortment of ailments kept him out of 12 games this
year, and it's pretty obvious that as soon as the playoffs are over
he will go to bed for about a month. He is really, really hurting.
He struggles to get up and down the floor, looking like a '49
Studebaker attempting to keep up with a bunch of Porsches.
</P>
<P>
   But Patrick Ewing has a fierce heart, and he wants to be in
there. You can feel very comfortable attaching the word
``inspiration'' to his name.

CHINA CHANGES STRATEGY FOR RESETTLING 1.3 MILLION PEOPLE FOR DAM
PROJECT
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In an implicit admission that severe problems bedevil
the giant Three Gorges Dam project, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji has
announced a major change in strategy for resettling at least 1.3
million people who will be driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, in a speech that was heavily publicized Monday, said more
of the people who will be uprooted by a new 400-mile-long lake on
the Yangtze River should be sent to distant parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The current effort to move displaced people to sites near their
old homes has been plagued by public bitterness, inadequate funds
and an acute shortage of cropland. But critics say the new solution
may be no more practical.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, given last week at a closed conference, Zhu also
said many of the industries facing inundation by the new dam were
so obsolete and polluting that they should simply be closed rather
than moved. He also issued a new warning against misuse of funds
intended to help the uprooted people.
</P>
<P>
   Half the front page of Monday's People's Daily, the flagship
newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, was devoted to an article
recounting Zhu's speech on the dam project and to an editorial
voicing similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The prominence given to Zhu's remarks suggests that he remains
in firm command of the government, with the support of President
Jiang Zemin and other Communist leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu is a proponent of deep market-oriented economic reforms and
closer ties with the West. Some Chinese and foreign political
experts have speculated that Zhu has been seriously weakened in the
anti-American atmosphere following the bombing of China's Embassy
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Three Gorges project is a special interest of Li Peng, the
conservative former Prime Minister who remains No. 2 in the
Communist Party, ahead of Zhu. Li and other leaders have portrayed
the Three Gorges Dam as an homage to China's prowess that will
provide great benefits in electric power and flood control.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, who replaced Li as prime minister last year, has never
shown enthusiasm for the dam, which will cost tens of billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although Monday's articles did not suggest that the project
should be halted, they differed markedly in tone from the usual
glowing accounts of progress.
</P>
<P>
   The project has long been attacked by critics abroad who say the
environmental and social costs will greatly outweigh the economic
benefits. Many Chinese privately question the dam, but over the
last decade public criticism has been suppressed. Only in the last
few months have sporadic articles in the official press mentioned
the emerging problems.
</P>
<P>
   The relocation of at least 1.3 million people from a 400-mile
stretch of the Yangtze River basin in central China, mostly in the
crowded, mountainous province of Sichuan, has emerged as the most
serious immediate obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   In the next four years, when the serpentine lake is to be partly
filled, more than 550,000 people, including poor farmers and
factory workers in hundreds of towns, must be moved and given new
livelihoods. As many more people again will have to be moved by
2008 when the project is competed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials assert that 160,000 people have already been
relocated. But private reports indicate that some people have
refused to move, that the slopes where farmers are being sent
cannot support new farming and that the meager funds to help
settlers have often been stolen or wasted.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a journal in Beijing published a searing critique
by an anonymous Chinese sociologist who said the plight of uprooted
people may become ``an explosive social problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The article, in the journal Strategy and Management, also
suggested that sending people to other parts of the country, the
new answer offered by Zhu, will be no panacea. ``In China,'' the
article said, ``all of the areas with better natural conditions
were filled with people long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, according to Monday's report, Zhu agreed that
farming the steep mountains along the Yangtze would cause erosion
and other ecological problems, ``creating endless harm.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged other provinces, regions and cities to
``enthusiastically absorb and resettle migrants and make more
contributions to the construction of the Three Gorges project.''

NATO ATTACKS DISRUPT ELECTRICITY, WATER SUPPLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite poor weather, NATO planes attacked
electrical transformers throughout Serbia early Monday in an
attempt to cut off the Yugoslav military communications and supply
links to Kosovo, Pentagon and NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By striking at the power complexes, the air campaign disrupted
daily civilian life, cutting off both electricity and the water
supply, since water pumping stations rely on electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Monday that their intention was to undercut
the military effort in Kosovo, not to hurt civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not targeted the water system,'' said Peter Daniel, a
NATO spokesman in Brussels, Belgium. ``The difficulties with water
supply relate mostly to the difficulties that exist with the supply
of electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official said that despite the problems caused to
civilians, targeting the electrical grid system is a legitimate
objective, since the military operation of President Slobodan
Milosevic depends upon electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware this will have an impact on civilians, but we are
in the midst of a military operation against Slobodan Milosevic,''
said a Pentagon official. ``Compare that to the consequences
suffered by the civilian population of Kosovo who have been driven
from their homes and have neither shelter, heat, water or food.''
</P>
<P>
   When NATO began hitting electrical plants earlier this month,
blacking out Belgrade and other cities, human rights groups
questioned whether the military benefits outweighed the harm they
caused to civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that in a modern society, the electrical grid
is critical to providing essential services, especially the water
system, which has serious consequences for civilian health,'' said
Dinah PoKempner, deputy general counsel of Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said that the allied warplanes had attacked power
transformers at Nis, Drmno and Novi Sad early Monday, to disrupt
the military's command system, the air defense systems and
propaganda transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   William Arkin, the military consultant to Human Rights Watch,
objected to the bombing. ``Didn't the Air Force learn its lesson
from Iraq?'' he asked. ``You cut off electricity and the water
supply, you undermine public health and undermine your own
objectives of not only achieving your military mission but winning
the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air war entered its third month, NATO and Pentagon
officials said the campaign was undermining the ability of
Milosevic to supply and maintain soldiers in Kosovo. Even though he
has been able to send replacements to Kosovo, the Pentagon said,
these troops have gone in without the usual equipment or supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marching in with troops without equipment probably makes them
feel good from the numbers standpoint, but it doesn't make them
effective from a standpoint of a very sophisticated military,''
said Air Force Major Gen. Charles Wald.
</P>
<P>
   Wald said there was evidence that the Yugoslav troops in Kosovo
are so low on fuel that they are taking gasoline from cars left
behind by fleeing refugees. Basic stocks are low, forcing soldiers
to forage for food.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not to the point where they're not effective,'' said
Wald. ``But it will be hard to sustain them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced the arrival of 20 fighter bombers, the
F/A-18D, at airbases in Hungary. Four more planes were expected to
arrive this week.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of training, the official said, the planes
will begin operations against targets in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   This month NATO officials expanded the basing of planes to
Hungary and Turkey to allow the air campaign to operate around the
clock. Without the introduction of ground troops, NATO is flying
more low-level missions over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's fleet of aircraft now numbers more than a thousand,
including 723 American airplanes and 281 aircraft from other
allies. This is more than twice the number originally committed in
March.

BUSH-PATAKI TICKET NO DONE DEAL DESPITE ENDORSEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARA JAKES and JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George Pataki became the 17th Republican state
chief executive Monday to endorse Texas Gov. George W. Bush for
president, setting up renewed speculation that the New Yorker was
positioning himself to become Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Pataki dreams of a date in November 2000 with Bush _
a prospect he refused to discuss Monday _ political analysts were
divided over whether he would be tapped from the long list of names
on Bush's dance card.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats said that even with Pataki on the ticket, New York
was unlikely to fall into the Republican column in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With GOP loyalists behind him on the podium of a Manhattan hotel
and several dozen reporters looking on, Pataki turned to a
10-foot-high video screen, where Bush appeared via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're here this morning not to talk about me, but to talk
about ideas,'' Pataki said. ``And that's why I am very proud this
morning to join with my colleagues in saying that not just me, but
New York state, is going to work to make sure that the next
president of the United States is my friend, the great governor
from Texas, Gov. George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid cheers, Bush said, ``The goal is much bigger than `The Two
Georges.' The goal is restoring dignity to the White House, and the
goal is to make sure America is better for everybody as we head
into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   With its 33 electoral votes _ the second-largest bloc in the
country, behind California _ New York is a crucial state to win in
a presidential election. Pataki backers say his presence on a
national ticket would sweep the Empire State for the Republicans, a
feat that has eluded the party since Ronald Reagan's 48-state 1984
landslide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George Pataki makes perfect sense for Bush,'' said New
York-based GOP strategist Jay Severin. ``When you look at a
Texas/New York axis, when you begin to calculate what it means to
Democrats if they're denied Texas and possibly New York, the math
becomes very daunting.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether Pataki could deliver New York for the GOP is, at
best, questionable. Democrats carried 52 of the state's 62 counties
in 1996. Pataki won a second term last fall with only 53 percent of
the vote against a significantly outspent Democrat, Peter Vallone.
And Democrats say the possible presence of Hillary Rodham Clinton
on the ballot for an open U.S. Senate seat now held by Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, could draw votes to their ticket.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party spokesman Matthew Hiltzik, pointing to
polls showing Pataki's approval rating has slid 17 points over the
last four months, said New Yorkers would be less likely to vote for
a national ticket that includes Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Some political observers said Monday that Pennsylvania Gov.
Thomas Ridge, for example, was a more likely pairing if Bush wins
the GOP nomination and seeks a moderate Republican governor. ``He's
pro-choice, he's a Vietnam vet and he's better looking,'' one
Democratic Party leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates mentioned by Republicans Monday included
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson or Michigan Gov. John Engler. Both
fit Bush's need for a moderate Republican from a big state far from
Texas, said Michael Edelman, a GOP analyst from Westchester County,
who also pointed to Arizona Sen. John McCain, a presidential
hopeful, as a potential vice presidential candidate if Bush is the
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   But as Bush weighs such factors as ideology, reputation and
geography, Edelman said, a Northeast governor like Pataki could
help him win.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki would not acknowledge that his endorsement could
translate into a vice presidential nomination, and he did not
answer when asked twice if he would be willing to give up the
governorship midway through his four-year term to join Bush in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Many at the event, however, said they were sure Pataki would
seize the vice presidential nomination, if offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. Without equivocation,'' said Rep. John Sweeney,
R-N.Y., a close Pataki political adviser. ``While that isn't one of
the primary goals that the governor based his (Bush endorsement)
decision on ... we're hoping that'll happen. It's incumbent upon us
to make this a success and do the good things that have to be done
for Governor Bush so Governor Pataki has a better opportunity at
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But state GOP Chairman Bill Powers, referring to the vice
presidential nomination, noted, ``You don't run for that. And if
you do, you don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pataki has scheduled political speeches this summer in
Detroit, California, Washington state and Montana _ engagements
Powers said the governor should keep in order to continue espousing
Republican themes of tax cuts, reducing welfare and crime control
and what Pataki called ``passionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Bush must first make his
final decision to run for president _ a decision that won't come
until after May 31, when the Texas Legislature adjourns _ before he
starts thinking about running mates. ``It's too early to
hypothesize about that,'' she said, when asked if a `George-George'
ticket was possible for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Republican Party unity that the governor touted
Monday, however, apparently did not extend to fellow Republican
Rudolph Giuliani, the mayor of New York City, who was not invited
to the endorsement event.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, a political rival of the governor's, is widely
considered the party favorite running for the Moynihan seat.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Pataki on the ballroom stage Monday was Rep. Rick Lazio,
a Long Island Republican, a yet-unannounced candidate for the same
Senate post.

PATTERNS: ROUNDING UP STARS TO LEND GLAMOUR TO FASHION AWARDS SHOW
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
STARS OF THE SHOW  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What would an awards ceremony be without celebrities? Lacking in
glamour, most people seem to think. So the Council of Fashion
Designers of America is working hard to corral Hollywood
personalities to participate in its annual awards show on June 2,
now called the American Fashion Awards. No matter that the only
clear connection may be that the performers wear designer clothes
(usually borrowed) at other awards ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who will be presenters are Chris Rock, who will give
Calvin Klein the men's wear designer of the year award, and Joanna
Margolies, who will fittingly cite In Style magazine for ``putting
the spotlight on fashion and Hollywood.'' Bette Midler and Martha
Stewart will give Simon Doonan of Barneys New York a special award
for his ``window on fashion.'' Rita Wilson, along with Donna Karan
and Klein, will bestow posthumous honors on Elizabeth Tilberis, who
was the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   Two actresses will be co-hosts of a television show, produced by
the council, that will precede the June 13 telecast of an edited
version of the awards ceremony on the E! cable network. The job
will be shared by Sela Ward, who won an Emmy for ``Sisters,'' and
Caroline Rhea, who plays Sabrina's aunt on ``Sabrina, the Teen-Age
Witch.''
</P>
<P>
   Other confirmed presenters, celebrities in the fashion world,
will be Donatella Versace, who will give the Eugenia Shepard award
for fashion journalism to Elsa Klensch of CNN; John Fairchild, the
former publisher of Women's Wear Daily, who will give the lifetime
achievement award to Yves Saint Laurent, and Andre Leon Talley of
Vogue, who will present the international award to Yohji Yamamoto.
</P>
<P>
   Not learning from last year's fiasco with Christine Baranski as
host, the council is negotiating with another actress to fill that
post but would not confirm the name.
</P>
<P>
   And there is still some question whether the biggest potential
stars of the evening _ Sophia Loren, who will be cited by the
council for a lifetime of glamour, and Cher, cited for her
influence on fashion _ will actually be at the ceremony. Last year,
a major dose of glamour was provided by Elizabeth Taylor, who
sparkled in dangling jeweled earrings and a silver-beaded white
dress that set off her white hair. She was honored for _ what else?
_ a lifetime of glamour.  &QL; 
FROM DAY INTO EVENING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After 36 years of making jewelry, 15 in his own business, Pedro
Boregaard refuses to be type-cast. His designs range from punklike
oxidized silver chains with menacing spikes, to rings with sawtooth
edges, to pretty little eggs and hearts inset with diamonds or
colored stones.
</P>
<P>
   ``My idea is to do jewelry in a modern way,'' he said the other
day in his Manhattan atelier, ``so the woman can put it on in the
morning and go out at night in the same jewelry. To create jewelry
with a glamorous luster is old hat. You have to do it for today's
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate his 15th anniversary this year, Boregaard, who was
born in Germany and learned his craft at a renowned Munich jeweler
called Hemmerle, was looking for a streamlined shape. He found it
in an unexpected place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was observing moths,'' he said, ``and I saw that when moths
sit they create a triangle. It's a very aerodynamic shape, like a
stealth fighter almost.''
</P>
<P>
   So he designed a collection of sleek moths with folded wings,
ranging from inchlong pins of oxidized silver and gold ($660) to a
two-and-a-half-inch-long mosaic brooch of three different golds set
with 11 carats of colored diamonds in shades of brown and beige
($65,000).
</P>
<P>
   His jewelry may be viewed by appointment: (212) 826-3660.

 &HT;    Honda snub has Georgia asking 'Why not here?'
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia likes to crow about its economic successes,
but car makers apparently remain unimpressed even as they have
scoured the Southeast for new factory sites.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Georgia recruiters have begun a hunt to find out what the
problem is. They plan to ask auto manufacturers what they can do
better.
</P>
<P>
   The latest hit came from Honda, which earlier this month
announced that it will employ 1,500 people and build a $400 million
assembly plant near Lincoln, Ala. Georgia officials were surprised.
They had never been told by company representatives that a site the
state offered northeast of metro Atlanta was no longer in the
running.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia offered Honda a free site, more than $20 million worth
of road improvements, a new worker training center, tax breaks and
encouragement from the governor and other top state officials. But
Honda didn't even talk directly with Georgia officials about their
offer.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in the 1990s, an automaker had chosen to
bring new jobs and money to a neighboring state. And for the third
time, Georgia didn't appear to be close in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, BMW selected a site in Greer, S.C., for a new plant.
Georgia apparently wasn't even in the running. A year later,
Mercedes-Benz announced it would take its considerable name and
clout to Vance, Ala., to build a $300 million assembly plant west
of Birmingham, Ala. Georgia, by some estimates, came in fourth. In
earlier years, other automakers came to the Southeast. Toyota went
to Kentucky, and Nissan and Saturn settled in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia economic recruiters say they aren't sure what's been
lacking in the state's offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make you pause and say, `What is it?' '' said John
Malone, a manager in economic development for Georgia Power. ``It's
a large project. You don't enjoy not at least being strongly
considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Georgia Department of Industry, Trade &AMP;
Tourism; Georgia Power; NationsBank; and other companies involved
in economic development say they will try to meet with Honda
officials, their site selection team and perhaps Mercedes
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all been reflecting on it,'' said Mike Lott,
NationsBank's vice president for economic development in Georgia.
``We need to find out some after-the-fact information.''
</P>
<P>
   Several recruiters aren't so sure Honda officials will agree to
sit down and talk candidly. There would be little benefit to the
company to highlight Georgia's shortcomings, recruiters say.
</P>
<P>
   That may leave the state's recruiters exactly where they are
now: Guessing why Georgia hasn't landed a new auto assembly plant
since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Cardoza, the commissioner of Georgia's Department of
Industry, Trade &AMP; Tourism, says he believes the presence of large
Ford and General Motors assembly plants in metro Atlanta was a
factor in Honda's decision. Both plants have unions. Cardoza said
that may scare off automakers who may fear unionization efforts at
new plants.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Jeff Humphreys from the University of Georgia says car
makers worry less about union demands for higher wages but more
about the flexibility they fear they would lose in a unionized
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is that Georgia traditionally does not offer
financial incentives as rich as those in neighboring states. While
Georgia officials never placed a value on the incentives they
offered to Honda, they said it fell well under the $158 million
pricetag that Alabama reported on its offer. Georgia also offered
far less than Alabama when that state attracted Mercedes with over
$250 million in enticements.
</P>
<P>
   Honda spokesman Jeffrey Smith said the company was ``leaning
very strongly toward Alabama'' even before financial incentives
were discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also said the presence of unions in existing auto plants
``is not really a factor'' in the placement of Honda's new assembly
plant. Instead, Smith said, Alabama emerged as a strong contender
early on because of issues such as its climate, transportation
network and large pool of available workers.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters also say Georgia has not felt the need to be as
aggressive as Alabama in the hunt for assembly plants. Georgia has
been able to rely on a healthy economy. Even in terms of
manufacturing jobs, Georgia has seen growth while the rest of the
nation has slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Car plants also raise air pollution issues. Metro Atlanta's air
pollution problems put limits on industry, and that could restrict
car makers, who have been most interested in the northern part of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state has also put some of its focus on other areas, such as
high-tech companies that may show more promise for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power's John Malone said that when Honda made its
announcement about Alabama, he was more concerned about the
similarly timed decision by Dell Computer Corp. to build a new
plant in Nashville that would employ 3,000. Georgia apparently was
not a top contender for Dell's facility, Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia officials say they will continue to compete for auto
plants. They could get extra tools for that effort soon. Some state
officials are pushing for money to buy or reserve large sites to
offer to large employers, such as assembly plants. And Georgia Gov.
Roy Barnes has said he intends to review the state's incentive
options this year to see if improvements are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Malone offers some ideas on how Georgia could bolster its
chances to attract auto makers: Be ready with broad and very
flexible incentive options. And, he said, create a team to include
the governor and the commissioner of the Department of Industry,
Trade &AMP; Tourism to court auto makers personally.
</P>
<P>
   Form a team, he said, ``that aggressively attacks this and
doesn't quit until they get a plant.''

JUSTICES PULL PLUG ON TELEVISED POLICE RAIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BENNETT ROTH  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a decision that could put a damper on televised
police raids, the Supreme Court ruled Monday that police officers
can be sued for allowing the media to accompany them on authorized
searches of private homes.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the justices agreed that so-called
media ride-alongs with police violate the Fourth Amendment
protections against unreasonable or unlawful searches.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was in response to two cases, from Maryland and
Montana, where officials were sued after they allowed members of
the media to accompany them on searches of private property.
</P>
<P>
   The court, however, held that the officers involved in the two
challenged searches could not be sued because the courts had not
previously established such actions as unconstitutional. The cases
occurred in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In writing for the court, Chief Justice William Rehnquist
emphasized the historic roots of the Fourth Amendment, which he
said ``embodies this centuries old principle of respect for the
privacy of the home.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice argued that while raids of homes are sometimes
necessary, police do not need to bring journalists or photographers
along to carry out their mission.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist also dismissed arguments by the police and media
organizations that having reporters along served the public because
it helped promote crime fighting efforts and deterred police from
abusive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely the possibility of good public relations for the police
is simply not enough, standing alone, to justify the ride-along
intrusion into a home,'' the chief justice stated. ``And even the
need for accurate reporting on police issues in general bears no
direct relation to the constitutional justification for the police
intrusion into a home in order to execute a felony arrest
warrant.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court's action will affect the spate of ``reality-based
television'' shows such as Fox network's popular ``Cops'' that
features live footage of police raids.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty four news organizations had filed a friend of the court
brief siding with the police officials.
</P>
<P>
   The media organizations argued that restricted access to such
raids would erode ``public understanding of government law
enforcement activities in a manner inimical to the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Monday's ruling a number of police departments have
moved to restrict live coverage of raids. The Los Angeles Police
Department issued guidelines in March that bars television cameras
from entering homes and other private property without the owners'
permission.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Police Department does not allow the media to
accompany them on raids, according to spokesman Robert Hurst. He
said the policy had been in effect at least as long as C.O.
Bradford had been chief of the department.
</P>
<P>
   The justices spelled out their rationale in a Maryland case
involving police authorities who allowed a Washington Post reporter
and photographer to accompany them when they entered the Rockville
home of Charles and Geraldine Wilson early one morning in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery County sheriff's deputies and deputy U.S.
marshals had been looking for the Wilson's son, Dominic, who had
violated his parole on several felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   But Dominic Wilson was not at the home at the time of the search
and instead the police awakened his parents. The police initially
confused the father with the son and subdued him while his wife
watched.
</P>
<P>
   During the incident the Post photographer took numerous
pictures, including one showing Wilson in his undershorts with a
police officer's gun to his head. The photographs were never
published.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilsons sued the police officers, but the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals threw out their lawsuit. The Supreme Court agreed
with the lower court's ruling that the officers could not be sued,
saying that until Monday they had not established the media
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The court came to the same conclusion in another case involving
a Montana rancher and his wife who sued after federal agents let a
Cable News Network reporter and camera crew accompany them on raid
of their property.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, about 20 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents had
raided the sheep and cattle ranch of Paul and Erma Berger searching
for evidence of eagle poisoning. Berger was acquitted of all
charges except the improper use of a pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   CNN used footage of the raid in a segment on government efforts
to protect endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Montana
couple could sue government officials as well as CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Once again the Supreme Court ruled that while such a search was
in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the officials involved in the
Montana raid could not be sued because they could have reasonably
believed that they were within their constitutional bounds to
invite the media along.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice John Paul Stevens differed from his colleagues
on the question of whether the officers in the two cases should be
held liable.
</P>
<P>
   In a lone dissent, Stevens wrote that the constitutional
principle guiding police searches was not a new one.

<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ After waiting with other refugees for 12
hours to cross the border into Macedonia, shivering in the freezing
rain, Zelije Hajdari, 75, said she decided last night that she did
not care where she went as long as the half dozen grandchildren who
were with her family made it to shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Isa Hasani, 54, said that after his group crossed the border, a
Macedonian policeman told them that if they did not get on the bus
they might be pushed back into Kosovo. And Musa Tomgola, 59, said
he was so disoriented and exhausted that he did not know where he
was going when he and his wife climbed aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The three of them and 500 other Albanian refugees from Kosovo
were the focus of a surreal, midnight standoff Sunday when
officials from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees blocked an attempt by Macedonian officials to send them
directly on to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian officials said the refugees had volunteered to go.
But some of the refugees themselves and officials of the refugee
agency said the refugees had been pressured into going or were
unaware of their intended destination. The standoff, which ended at
2:30 a.m. when the refugees were sent to a nearby camp, prompted
bitter recriminations Monday morning, and symbolized the rising
tensions here as the largest influx of refugees into Macedonia in
three weeks continued.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive day, thousands of Albanians crossed
the border into Macedonia on Monday as Serbian forces continued a
new wave of mass expulsions from Pristina, Kosovo's provincial
capital, and towns across southeastern Kosovo. More than 20,000
refugees have arrived in Macedonia in the past three days, 6,000 of
them on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrivals have increased the sense of uneasiness in a
small country of 2 million people where long-running tensions
between the Slav majority and Albanian minority have been
exacerbated by the arrival of more than 240,000 Albanian refugees
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Macedonians, Slavs who generally sympathize with the
Serbian effort to hold onto the Kosovo province, fear that if the
influx continues, they may find themselves in the minority here.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, local Albanians _ up to one-third of the
country's population _ are angered by what human rights activists
say is the government's latest heavy-handed effort to contain the
number of Albanian refugees here by shipping some of them to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Arben Xhefari, a member of the country's fragile coalition
government and the leader of Macedonia's major Albanian party, said
Monday that he was still investigating what occurred Sunday night
and Monday morning, but he warned that all movements of refugees
from Macedonia must be voluntary. ``This is a principle of
international law,'' he said. ``You cannot deport the deportees
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is expected to continue to arise. If the influx of
refugees continues at the same rate, refugee camps here will be
filled to capacity on Wednesday, refugee agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, after the standoff ended, Boris Trajkovski,
Macedonia's deputy foreign minister, asked NATO countries to back
the plan to ease the pressure by offering refugees who arrived at
the border the opportunity to be sent to Albania immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the refugee agency and human rights activists
cited the procedures Sunday night as an example of how such an
approach was ripe for abuse. Benjamin Ward, a researcher for Human
Rights Watch, said that international law guaranteed refugees safe
haven and warned that frightened, exhausted refugees could be
easily pressured into allowing themselves to be sent on to Albania.
``Refugees who in some cases have been on the road for days and
weeks, who are physically exhausted and psychologically frail are
in no state to make a free choice about matters that could affect
their lives for months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the refugees, the dispute causes further agony. Ms. Hajdari,
who spent 12 hours waiting on the border with her grandchildren,
said her family had spent three weeks living off bread and salt in
the woods. One of the young children with her showed signs of
severe hunger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people were crying and screaming and it was cold,'' she
said of the scene at the border. ``I ran from the Serbs and I came
here and I didn't get anything. There has to be an open door for us
somewhere.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats here, eager to keep Macedonia stable, played
down the dispute. American and European diplomats have generally
followed a course of trying to be supportive to the fragile
Macedonian government, arguing that attacking the Macedonians could
alienate them and further destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of getting into the minutiae,'' said a
Western diplomat, referring to the dispute. ``The larger issue is
that the people are getting out of Kosovo and getting refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the mistrust of Macedonian intentions stems from an
incident in early April, shortly after the NATO bombing brought the
first wave of Kosovo Albanians over the border. On that occasion,
Macedonian police, again working in the dead of night, rousted
thousands of Albanians and shipped most to other camps across
Macedonia, and several hundred to Albania and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the U.N. refugee agency also accused Macedonian
police of pushing 1,000 refugees back into Kosovo under cover of
darkness on May 5, the height of the last large refugee influx.
Macedonian officials vehemently denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday night's incident, five buses arrived at the border
crossing here. Refugee agency officials said they initially assumed
the buses would carry some of the 3,000 to 4,000 refugees waiting
to be processed by Macedonian border guards to refugee camps in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   But Macedonian police loaded the buses and told the refugee
agency the refugees had volunteered to go directly to Albania.
Because they had not been told of the plan in advance and had not
interviewed the refugees themselves, the refugee agency officials
used another vehicle to block the convoy. They also called
reporters and at one point even considered forming a human chain to
block the buses.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis McNamara, the refugee agency's special envoy to the
region, arrived at the scene and angrily accused the Macedonian
government of breaking repeated promises to keep the border open.
</P>
<P>
   After negotiations, Macedonian officials bused the 500 people to
the nearby Brazda refugee camp at 2:30 a.m. The remaining refugees,
numbering several thousand, were finally placed in a transit camp
just over the border here, said Astrid van Genderen Stort, a
refugee agency border monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Trajkovski, the Macedonian official, said all of the refugees
wanted to go to Albania and refugee agency officials agreed that
some, in fact did. He added that the plan to bus people to Albania
was first suggested by NATO countries when the overcrowded camps
were near the breaking point during the earlier influx.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee camps have been built in southern Albania to house
refugees from Macedonia, but only 260 refugees have voluntarily
gone there. Many stay in Macedonia because they have an opportunity
to move to Western Europe and the United States from here. In
Albania, they do not.
</P>
<P>
   Trajkovski complained that NATO countries were not keeping their
promise to evacuate more of the refugees and help Macedonia's
collapsing economy.

COKE PURSUES SCALED DOWN CADBURY DEAL
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the face of resistance from regulators around the world, the
Coca-Cola Co. scaled back its agreement Monday to buy the
soft-drink brands of Cadbury Schweppes PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The companies had announced a $1.85 billion deal in December in
which Coca-Cola agreed to buy Cadbury's brands worldwide, but
regulators in Australia, Mexico, Belgium and the European Union
have rejected or expressed concern in recent weeks about the
purchase, usually because of the increased market dominance it
would give Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to preserve as much of the deal as possible, Coca-Cola will
pay $1.1 billion to control brands like Dr Pepper, Schweppes and
Crush except in most of the European Union countries. The deal is
expected to close by July in most of the countries and will be cut
back further if certain countries do not approve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Coke would not have wanted this to happen, and
neither would Cadbury,'' Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst for
Salomon Smith Barney, said. ``It's a disappointment to both
parties, but I don't think it's a shock to investors. Everyone was
starting to get nervous about the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Baskin, a Coca-Cola spokesman, said the revised agreement
came about because of ``regulatory resistance in certain countries
within the European Union, and they would have resulted in
unacceptable delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Baskin said the new agreement would mean about 500 million cases
of additional annual volume for Coca-Cola compared with 600 million
under the original plan. ``It's still a good strategic move for
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest effect would seem to be on Cadbury's plans. When the
sale of its international brands was first announced, Cadbury
executives made much of the fact that the sale would free them to
concentrate on a fresh strategy: expanding their global
confectionery business as well as building up their bottling
network and running their soft-drink business in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new terms, Cadbury will continue selling its brands in
19 countries in Western Europe, including Belgium, Germany, Italy,
Spain and Switzerland, but not in Britain, its largest market. The
company will also retain Norway and Sweden, for what a spokeswoman
called ``geographic completeness.'' The company will also continue
to sell its brands in France, which would have been true under the
original plan as well.

COURT OPENS WAY FOR PEER HARASSMENT SUITS IN SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Addressing a different school-safety issue and
expanding the definition of illegal gender discrimination, a
sharply divided Supreme Court told the nation's schools Monday that
they can be sued for student-on-student sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision _ its first on the issue of peer harassment in
schools _ the court ruled that educational institutions receiving
federal funds would be liable for monetary damages if they are
``deliberately indifferent'' to student-on-student harassment ``so
severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive'' that it interferes
with the victim's education.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling had the immediate effect of reviving a lawsuit
brought in 1992 by Aurelia Davis, who had unsuccessfully argued
that the Monroe County (Ga.) Board of Education had not done enough
to protect her fifth-grade daughter, LaShonda, from the persistent
and unbearable sexual advances of a 10-year-old male classmate
identified in court records as ``G.F.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's advocacy groups generally hailed the Davis decision as
an important milestone in the interpretation of the laws barring
gender discrimination. Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the
National Women's Law Center, which argued the Davis case before the
high court, called it ``a very important win for women and girls in
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision also sent chills through the country's elementary
and secondary schools as well as colleges and universities that
receive federal funds. Julie Underwood, general counsel for the
National School Boards Association, said schools could take some
comfort that the court had set ``an awfully high standard'' for
liability. ``It is one we can live with,'' Underwood said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``deliberately indifferent'' standard is identical to the
one the court set last year in the case of a Texas teacher who had
a secret, sexual affair with a student. The court ruled that under
Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments, the victim could not
recover damages because the school district was not aware of the
harassment and therefore not liable for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the Davis case, the majority found, the Monroe County school
board remained idle in the face of knowing a student was harassing
another student in its schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having previously determined that `sexual harassment' is
`discrimination' in the school context under Title IX, we are
constrained to conclude that student-on-student sexual harassment,
if sufficiently severe, can likewise rise to the level of
discrimination actionable under the statute,'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor wrote for the majority.
</P>
<P>
   But in a biting dissent, the court minority predicted the ruling
would both set off ``runaway litigation'' by parents who mistake
childish conduct for harassment and unduly burden schools with new
costs and policing obligations. In an unusual turn, Justice Anthony
Kennedy read from the dissent in open court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of defending against peer sexual harassment suits
alone could overwhelm many school districts,'' Kennedy wrote.
``Some schools lack the resources even to deal with serious
problems of violence and are already overwhelmed with disciplinary
problems of all kinds.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, chided the court
majority for being ``oblivious to the fact that almost every child,
at some point, has trouble in school because he or she is being
teased by his or her peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girl who wants to skip recess because she is teased by
boys is no different from the overweight child who skips gym class
because the other children tease her about her size in the locker
room, or the child who risks flunking out because he refuses to
wear glasses to avoid the taunts of `four eyes,' '' Kennedy wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The court majority, including Justices John Paul Stevens, David
H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer, called those
comparisons ``misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the school setting, students often engage in insults,
banter, teasing, shoving, pushing, and gender-specific conduct that
is upsetting'' but not discrimination, O'Connor wrote. ``Damages
are only available where the behavior is so severe, pervasive and
objectively offensive that it denies victims equal access to
education.''
</P>
<P>
   LaShonda Davis and her mother reported numerous incidents of
grabbing, groping, and suggestive talk by G.F., but school
officials did not discipline him. The boy eventually pleaded guilty
to charges of sexual battery after Mrs. Davis complained to the
county sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Alzapiedi is executive director of the Title IX
Advocacy Project, a nonprofit education organization that monitors
sexual harassment in middle and secondary schools in the Boston
area. She said serious harassment is often minimized as harmless
teasing, when in fact it is widespread and can have a ``devastating
impact'' on victims who experience depression, anxiety, and even
miss school because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope that today's decision will be a wake-up call to
school officials who do not respond to complaints of peer sexual
harassment and to those officials who have ignored the sexual
harassment that they have witnessed between students,'' Alzapiedi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Rodriques, an employment lawyer with the Boston firm of
Sullivan &AMP; Worcester, said universities could be at high risk for
liability because of the age of the college population, its social
freedom, and the typical hands-off attitude of college
administrators toward students' personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put yourself at Harvard,'' Rodriques said, ``and how much do
officials know, or want to know, about sexual harassment in a
mixed-up environment where students are studying, playing, going to
class, and sleeping together?''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled last year that employers can be held
liable in a sexual harassment suit if they do not enforce policies
preventing misconduct by managers and supervisors. The standard is
higher for school administrators _ they can't be sued for what they
did not know _ but ``the bar being high doesn't mean schools won't
get sued, and it won't be a pain in the neck,'' Rodrigues said.
</P>
<P>
   W. Warren Plowden Jr. of Macon, Ga., who represented the school
board, said he was ``disappointed'' with the high court ruling but
believed having to prove school officials are ``deliberately
indifferent'' would still be difficult for plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 97-843.

 &HT;    Palm VII buyers get early Web link
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Monday morning, 150 versions of the new Palm VII that
had been sold in metropolitan New York were _ wirelessly _
activated.
</P>
<P>
   Although the device's formal launch was not until 4 p.m.at the
Rainbow Room, those who bought the Palm VII earlier were able to
register and connect to BellSouth's national wireless network
within minutes, linking to the Internet as they walked, drove or
sat and watched the pigeons in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working on this for almost three years,'' said
William F. Lenahan, president and chief executive of BellSouth
Wireless Data. ``I think this is a breakthrough kind of product.''
</P>
<P>
   Those first purchasers of the hand-held Palm VII are likely not
impulse buyers, since the device costs about $600.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Palm Computing, a subsidiary of 3Com, the Palm VII is at
its heart like the popular predecessor Palm Pilots, a personal
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   But built into the Palm VII is the ability to connect to the
Net, and those signals _ both upload and down _ are carried on the
same network used for BellSouth's interactive paging service.
</P>
<P>
   To make it work quickly enough, a Palm user has access to only
stripped-down Web sites. But perhaps more likely to draw users is
the ability to do financial transactions, send messages or receive
stock prices all day long.
</P>
<P>
   Others _ notably Psion and Microsoft _ are mounting their own
challenges with wireless devices aimed at the same market as Palm
VII. But Palm has something of a headstart.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3 million people use the Palm Pilot. ``If only 10
percent of them upgrade, that would be hundreds of thousands of
users. We see it as a significant impact on BellSouth's Wireless
Data network,'' said Lenahan.
</P>
<P>
   Users choose a monthly plan from $10 up, paying Palm Computing,
which in turn pays BellSouth for use of the network. ``By the end
of the year, I think (the revenue) from this will be significant.''
</P>
<P>
   While the devices are for sale now only in New York, Connecticut
and New Jersey, they are to be sold nationally by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   But they work on the national network right away, so a buyer can
use their Internet access anywhere in the country that BellSouth's
system works.

   SCOTUS-HARASS (Washington) _ The Supreme Court rules, 5 to 4,
that school boards can be sued for student-on-student sex
harassment. Associate Justice O'Connor, in the majority opinion,
notes that sex harassment in schools is serious, and that when a
school district is on notice that a student's education is impaired
and does nothing it can be sued. In the view of the minority, this
decision opens the way for the federal government to get involved
in such things as student desk assignments. By Linda Greenhouse.

COURT RULES AGAINST FEMINIST PROFESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A feminist theologian who has refused to admit men to
her classes lost a crucial early round Monday in her fight to keep
her teaching job at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex Superior Court Judge Martha B. Sosman said BC has
adequate cause to fire Mary Daly, citing Daly's defiance of college
policy that all courses be open to male and female students.
</P>
<P>
   The judge refused to bar BC from distributing a catalog next
month that omits courses taught by Daly or from telling people Daly
had retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston College made a strong showing in support of its
contention that Daly did in fact agree to retire,'' Sosman said, in
denying Daly's request for a preliminary injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Rulings on preliminary injunctions are often seen as a harbinger
of how lawsuits will fare when they go to trial. Daly's suit
follows repeated clashes with college administrators over her
exclusion of men from her classes.
</P>
<P>
   Daly's attorney, Gretchen Van Ness, said she is looking at
possible grounds for appeal of Sosman's decision, but Daly
nevertheless plans to take her case to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always more facts and more law to be developed over
the course of the trial,'' Van Ness said. ``We are still optimistic
we will have a full and fair hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge found that after senior Duane Naquin threatened to sue
BC over his exclusion from a course taught by Daly, the school told
Daly she could not prevent or try to dissuade males from taking her
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daly took the position that she would rather resign than admit
male students to her class,'' Sosman said.
</P>
<P>
   Daly and the college began negotiating a severance package,
although no final agreement was ever signed.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, 70, who has taught women-only courses at BC for a quarter
century, said she only agreed to take a leave of absence this
spring and planned to return to teaching this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no formal hearing and no formal notice to
her,'' said Van Ness. ``She has been simply erased from the course
catalog. All the rights that she has as a tenured professor have
been trampled on by Boston College.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sosman ruled that even if ultimately Daly's ``oral promise
to resign'' isn't found to be legally binding, ``there is no
question that the school has adequate cause to terminate Daly'' due
to her ``vehement and very public defiance'' of the school's
non-discrimination policy.
</P>
<P>
   BC spokesman Jack Dunn said college officials have reprimanded
Daly on five occasions over the past two decades for refusing to
let males into her class.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, whose books include ``Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of
Radical Feminism'' and ``Quintessence . . . Realizing the Archaic
Future: A Radical Elemental Feminist Manifesto,'' has said her
courses lose their impact if men enroll, because women become
inhibited when men are in the room.

 &HT;    Coke scales down Cadbury deal
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co., bending to European antitrust
regulators, has scaled back its proposed purchase of Cadbury
Schweppes' brands outside the United States by eliminating most
European markets from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies said Monday that the revised $1.1 billion
agreement for Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, Crush and Schweppes brands now
covers 106 countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland and
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The original deal announced last December was valued at $1.85
billion and covered 126 nations, including Germany, Italy and
Spain. Those three countries have been dropped, along with 17 other
European nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies have now concluded that regulatory resistance in
certain countries within the European Union would probably result
in unacceptable delay,'' Cadbury said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury Chief Executive John Sunderland told reporters it was no
longer fruitful to keep ``banging our heads against a regulatory
brick wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola was more measured in its comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sincerely believed that the original deal was a good one
for all parties, and that the transaction and notifications were
sensitive to all relevant legal requirements,'' Coca-Cola Chairman
and Chief Executive M. Douglas Ivester said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we may have disagreed with some of the conclusions that
were reached, we continue, as always, to have complete respect for
the regulatory processes,'' Ivester added.
</P>
<P>
   But several industry analysts said Coca-Cola may have mishandled
the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question arises: Was Coke prepared from a regulatory
standpoint?'' said Deutsche Bank analyst Scott Wilkins. ``Did they
do their regulatory homework? ... It's usually not positive when
the shape of a deal is changed in midstream, and this deal is still
not consummated.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said the companies made a pragmatic move, given
the unanticipated regulatory obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is trademark Ivester,'' said John Sicher, editor and
publisher of Beverage Digest. ``It's coming up with the best
solution in a set of circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the biggest deal announced by Coca-Cola since Ivester
took the helm from the late Roberto C. Goizueta in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in Australia and Mexico _ key markets _ also have
opposed the initial deal as anti-competitive. The companies have
submitted a revised proposal in Australia in hopes of winning
regulatory approval the second time around. They hope to do the
same in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' decision in Europe comes after EU Competition
Commissioner Karel Van Miert chastised Coca-Cola for trying to
bypass EU antitrust review by dealing with the regulators for each
country.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola and Cadbury argued that the EU did not have
jurisdiction in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium's regulators already have rejected the deal, and Germany
was reportedly poised to do the same. France has never been part of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The European pullout means the total deal, if completed in its
present form, would add nearly 500 million cases to Coca-Cola's
annual volume. The original deal covered more than 600 million
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Both Coca-Cola and industry analysts expect the volume figures
to rise considerably when the Cadbury brands are put into
Coca-Cola's vast distribution network around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cadbury Schweppes brands give us growth opportunities in
flavor segments where we currently don't have products,'' said
Coca-Cola spokesman Robert Baskin.
</P>
<P>
   While the new deal allows Cadbury to sell its European brands
not covered by the deal to other companies, including Pepsico,
Cadbury said it planned to continue to operate them for the
``foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   A few analysts even speculated that Coca-Cola would take another
swipe at Cadbury's European brands in a few years, if the
regulatory climate changes.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico spokesman Jeff Brown said he would not speculate on what
his company might do in the wake of the new deal.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the agreement will be completed in stages. The
companies hope to close the deal in about half the countries in
July, with many other closings by end of the third quarter. It
could be a longer process in several countries, possibly the United
Kingdom, Mexico and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's shares fell $1.18 3/4 Monday to close at $66.81 1/4
on the New York Stock Exchange.

COKE PURSUES SCALED DOWN CADBURY DEAL
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the face of resistance from regulators around the world, the
Coca-Cola Co. scaled back its agreement yesterday to buy the
soft-drink brands of Cadbury Schweppes PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The companies had announced a $1.85 billion deal in December in
which Coca-Cola agreed to buy Cadbury's brands worldwide, but
regulators in Australia, Mexico, Belgium and the European Union
have rejected or expressed concern in recent weeks about the
purchase, usually because of the increased market dominance it
would give Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to preserve as much of the deal as possible, Coca-Cola will
pay $1.1 billion to control brands like Dr Pepper, Schweppes and
Crush except in most of the European Union countries. The deal is
expected to close by July in most of the countries and will be cut
back further if certain countries do not approve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Coke would not have wanted this to happen, and
neither would Cadbury,'' Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst for
Salomon Smith Barney, said. ``It's a disappointment to both
parties, but I don't think it's a shock to investors. Everyone was
starting to get nervous about the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Baskin, a Coca-Cola spokesman, said the revised agreement
came about because of ``regulatory resistance in certain countries
within the European Union, and they would have resulted in
unacceptable delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Baskin said the new agreement would mean about 500 million cases
of additional annual volume for Coca-Cola compared with 600 million
under the original plan. ``It's still a good strategic move for
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest effect would seem to be on Cadbury's plans. When the
sale of its international brands was first announced, Cadbury
executives made much of the fact that the sale would free them to
concentrate on a fresh strategy: expanding their global
confectionery business as well as building up their bottling
network and running their soft-drink business in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new terms, Cadbury will continue selling its brands in
19 countries in Western Europe, including Belgium, Germany, Italy,
Spain and Switzerland, but not in Britain, its largest market. The
company will also retain Norway and Sweden, for what a spokeswoman
called ``geographic completeness.'' The company will also continue
to sell its brands in France, which would have been true under the
original plan as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury will also give up its business in Ireland and Greece,
said the spokeswoman, Dora McCabe. The company's chief executive,
John Sunderland, insisted in a statement that its strategy remained
intact. ``We will still receive a significant cash sum whilst
retaining our strong European soft drinks business,'' he said.
``What we are doing removes uncertainty for our employees, for our
bottlers and our shareowners, and ensures a swifter conclusion to
the transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, because it is keeping most of its European beverage
operations, Cadbury will be forced to hold onto about half of its
bottling plants, worth about $800 million. The company had eagerly
anticipated selling them in a separate transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Coca-Cola fell $1.1875 Monday, to $66.8125, while the
American depository receipts of Cadbury fell 62.5 cents, to
$55.375.
</P>
<P>
   Talks regarding a revised deal began in earnest just more than a
week ago, Mrs. McCabe said. There were indications earlier,
however, that both companies might have been rethinking their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters at a beverage conference on May 13,
Cadbury's global managing director of beverages, John T. Brock,
said the European Union's opposition was the result of
anti-American sentiment stemming from other trade issues, including
beef and bananas. ``The relationship between the U.S. and the E.U.
right now is not at an all-time high,'' he said, adding that ``it
is a political issue at least as much as a regulatory issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same meeting, Brock said he was ``convinced that there is
a deal to be done that will be value-creating for both Coke and
Cadbury.'' He added, ``If at some point we and Coke concluded it
made sense not to do this deal, there are other deals we could
do.'' He called the agreement one that ``made sense at the time but
it is not a deal that is critical to our future.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing chorus of criticism was hard to ignore, analysts
said, and both Coca-Cola and Cadbury wanted to avoid having their
agreement delayed further. Coca-Cola may have been worried about
the specter of another bureaucratic stalemate like the one the
company is still trying to resolve in France regarding its purchase
of the Orangina brand from Pernod Ricard SA. That purchase has been
pending since it was announced in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have given up many small countries in which their share
was small anyway,'' said Michael Bellas, chief executive of
Beverage Marketing, a research and consulting firm for the beverage
industry. ``The big countries are still in place. This
restructuring won't affect them, and it will probably appease the
European group.''
</P>
<P>
   The question remains as to whether Cadbury will seek a new buyer
for its brands in Europe. Some industry experts think Coca-Cola
will end up owning them eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never say never,'' said John D. Sicher, publisher of Beverage
Digest, an industry newsletter.

 &HT;    Long-term care firm planning to restructure
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NewCare Health Corp., an Atlanta-based long-term care
company, announced a restructuring Monday that includes contracting
with a Massachusetts-based firm to manage its operations.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring is to reduce operating losses, NewCare said in
a press release. The company also said it recently sold five
facilities to reduce debt. NewCare operates 38 nursing homes,
assisted-living centers and independent-living facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Lenox Healthcare, a privately held Pittsfield, Mass.-based
company, will take over operations of NewCare starting June 1.
Lenox will appoint two members to NewCare's board and will acquire
an undisclosed number of shares of common stock and warrants.
</P>
<P>
   NewCare executives could not be reached for comment on the
changes. Shares of NewCare rose 12 1/2 cents to close at 87 1/2
cents in Nasdaq trading Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NewCare lost $5.5 million on revenue of $19.4 million in the
first quarter of 1999, ending March 31. For the 1998 year, it lost
$7.8 million on revenue of $66.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   NewCare linked the need for restructuring to recent reductions
in Medicare reimbursements. Last year Medicare switched to a system
that pays fixed daily fees for patients according to illness,
instead of reimbursing nursing homes for their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Citing that payment change, Atlanta-based Mariner Post-Acute
Network, which also operates nursing homes, last week reported a
second-quarter loss of about $79 million and announced it was
laying off 7,300 employees.

<P>
   VIETRI SUL MARE, Italy _ The ``eco-monster'' that ate the Amalfi
coast is sinking back into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   For years environmentalists have pointed to the Fuenti, a huge,
ultramodern concrete hotel perched high on a rocky cliff
overlooking the Mediterranean, as Italy's worst ``eco-monster,'' an
eyesore that is also a particularly shameless example of
abusivismo, the Italian art of illegal construction.
</P>
<P>
   The battle to demolish the hotel, which began almost as soon as
the first girders went up in 1968, took 30 years and countless
lawsuits, and even prompted parliament to pass a special law to
insure that the Fuenti would be razed. It is one of the most
important victories for Italian environmentalists in decades.
</P>
<P>
   But it also illustrates one of the deeper complexities of
conservation, Italian style. ``In Italy we have 150,000 laws,'' a
lawyer said, ``and we can use them to reward our friends and punish
our enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fierce objections of the owner, as well as local
officials and residents, who hoped that the hotel would create jobs
in a region troubled by high unemployment, the environmentalists
won. In April bulldozers and specially built cranes began tearing
at the hotel walls and concrete terraces, which are supposed to
vanish by late June.
</P>
<P>
   The environment minister, Edo Ronchi, recently flew over the
site in a helicopter to make sure demolition crews were doing just
that. After that show of force, unemployed workers from Naples who
had earlier occupied the site to try to block the bulldozers began
passing out shards of tile, cement and faucets as souvenirs of
their protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Fuenti, which was labeled one of Italy's 10 most hideous
``eco-monsters'' by Legambiente, Italy's largest conservation
group, is a milestone in the organization's effort to correct
architectural and zoning abuses of the postwar period.
</P>
<P>
   It is only one of hundreds of similar illegal constructions, and
a drop in the bucket when set against the 20,000 to 25,000 new
illegal buildings that go up every year in Italy. But the Fuenti's
infamously jarring modern architectural style set on one of Italy's
most picturesque coasts has made it an international cause celebre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to win this one,'' Michele Buonomo, a local Legambiente
activist, said. ``The hotel had to be torn down. This is just too
important a symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what infuriates opponents, who assert that
the Fuenti was singled out to make a political point at the locals'
expense.
</P>
<P>
   They would have preferred to remove some of the more offending
parts of the hotel, disguise the rest behind lemon trees and
shrubbery and put it to profitable use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say you have a daughter and she is really ugly,'' said
Dante Mazzitelli, the owner whose father built the hotel. ``OK,
maybe you get her a nose job, a chin implant,'' he said
passionately. ``But you don't kill her.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy is a country with a widely shared sense of beauty, and
esthetics plays as large a role in Italy's efforts to reclaim
historic landscapes as abuses of the zoning laws.
</P>
<P>
   The charms of the seven-story, 35,000-square-foot Fuenti are
perhaps more suited to downtown Riyadh than a winding coast dotted
by famous fishing villages like Ravello and Positano. The Fuenti is
in Vietri Sul Mare, a lovely seaside town famous for its handmade
ceramic tiles and pottery.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he considered the Fuente ugly, the Mayor of Vietri,
Cesare Marciano, shrugged. ``Let's say it is classic 60s style,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He long sought to delay the destruction, which he says is less a
symbol of the state's power than of its underlying impotence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't pick Fuenti because it was the worst case,''
Marciano said. ``I can show you a hundred buildings down the coast
to Positano that are as bad or worse. They chose it because they
had a better chance of success here than anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists do not disagree. Legambiente has not yet
succeeded in dismantling the illegal houses built on the perimeter
of the famous Greek temples of Agrigento in Sicily, or tearing down
a large unfinished hotel in Cinque Terre. Throughout Italy _
particularly in the south, where organized crime is deep-rooted _
unchecked construction has contributed to landslides, flooding and
lethal mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   Though it took 30 years, the razing of the Fuenti was possible
in part because the hotel was never fully operational. Except for
four years from 1980 to 1984, when the government contracted with
the hotel to house homeless victims of the 1980 earthquake in
Irpinia, the Fuenti has remained empty.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not have to put people out of work to tear it
down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 the owner had a building permit, but he did what was a
common practice then, and still now: he built higher and wider than
his permit allowed. Italian law almost encourages such
disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining all the correct paperwork to build or remodel is a
nightmarish crawl through red tape. Organized crime has perfected
the short cuts, but many ordinary citizens also end up on the wrong
side of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Every few years, Italy issues amnesties for illegal
construction, allowing even flagrant abusers to pay a relatively
small fine for their infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Many apply to pay the fine even before they begin building. In
1994 in Catania, in Sicily, there were so many requests for advance
pardons that the Mayor demanded that petitioners submit a
photograph of the building for which they sought amnesty. In
response, arsonists burned down the archives of the city planning
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners of the Fuenti were unlucky,'' Ermete Realacci, the
president of Legambiente, conceded. ``So many people bet on their
chances of getting an amnesty, or sliding past bureaucratic
inertia, and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Realacci said he hoped the razing of the Fuenti would serve as
an example. So, in a way, did Mazzitelli, the owner. As he stonily
watched a crane crush through the fifth story of his hotel,
Mazzitelli said: ``If they want to apply the law, great. Then let
justice be applied without distinctions. They should tear down half
the buildings along the Amalfi coast.''

 &HT;    $12 billion to aid Atlanta area housing
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fannie Mae will invest $12 billion over the next five
years to help 160,000 low- and moderate-income families in Clayton,
Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties buy their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money will be used for down payment assistance to
get families into their own houses.
</P>
<P>
   The successes of previous initiatives and Atlanta's vibrant
housing market prompted the new efforts, Fannie Mae's chairman and
chief executive officer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see this at Summerdale Commons, Techwood/Centennial
Place, City Plaza and the Park at Briarcliff,'' Franklin D. Raines
told a crowd of about 200 gathered in Mechanicsville, a
neighborhood two blocks southeast of Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street on Ralph David Abernathy Boulevard are 16 two-
and three-bedroom townhomes, part of the 48-unit development Ware
Estates.
</P>
<P>
   Nearing completion now and priced between $95,000 and $120,000,
they sold out within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of the project has 50 buyers on its waiting
list.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae invests directly in multifamily housing projects and
uses bond programs to enable eligible families to buy homes with
below-market interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Ware Estates is being developed by the Urban Residential
Development Corp. and Summech, a nonprofit community development
corporation in the Mechanicsville, Summerhill and Peoplestown
neighborhoods that span some 40 blocks south of I-75/85 and east of
I-20.
</P>
<P>
   Although the area is enjoying renewal activity now was recently
full of dilapidated houses and, as Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell
said, ``ravaged by the success of the (Atlanta) Braves and Braves
fans' parking and trash.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was among dozens of city, state and federal officials
attending Raines' presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Raines said the $12 billion, with Ware Estates as its catalyst,
would revitalize neighborhoods located in other parts of the
five-county area, not just downtown.
</P>
<P>
   It will fund a market study to determine specific housing needs
for the target counties.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the new HouseAtlanta initiative will include new
underwriting plans and the continued rejuvenation of Auburn Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae's cooperating partners include the Atlanta
Development Authority, SunTrust, Capital City Bank, Wachovia,
Citizens Trust Bank, Enterprise Social Investment Corp. and
foundation, Atlanta Neighborhood Development Partnership and United
Way.
</P>

Fannie Mae will guarantee mortgages up to $240,000.
</P>

ALBRIGHT SAYS SADDAM'S FOES ARE BUILDING A UNIFIED FRONT  (ms) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with the
leaders of Iraqi opposition groups Monday, the first encounter the
secretary has had with such leaders and an indication of the
Clinton administration's efforts to build a more cohesive
opposition against Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between Albright and nearly a dozen Iraqi opposition
leaders came as the State Department announced moves to supply the
opposition with non-lethal assistance such as offices and
communication equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Iraqi Liberation Act passed by Congress last year, $97
million was made available for lethal and non-lethal aid to seven
opposition groups intent on overthrowing the Iraqi president.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the administration appointed Frank Ricciardone, a
Foreign Service officer, as special representative for transition
in Iraq and the official responsible for overseeing administration
policy toward the Iraqi opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   The administration decided to move ahead with supporting the
opposition groups, including Ahmed Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi
National Congress, despite skepticism at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the operations in northern Iraq of the Iraqi National
Congress were decimated by the Iraqi army and Chalabi was out of
favor with the administration after that debacle. But Chalabi
lobbied Congress to pass the $97 million plan and hoped to get his
group designated as the main recipient.
</P>
<P>
   The top American commander in the Middle East, Gen. Anthony C.
Zinni of the Marine Corps, warned last year that none of the
existing groups was strong enough to either unify the opposition or
topple Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   After Albright met with the opposition leaders, the assistant
secretary for Near East affairs, Martin Indyk, said the support for
the groups was one facet of the overall policy to change the regime
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political effort from the outside to delegitimize
Saddam,'' Indyk said.
</P>
<P>
   The broader policy embraced the continuing bombing by the United
States of Iraq, economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation, Indyk
said.
</P>
<P>
   The first funds from the $97 million would be spent on training
the opposition groups in civil administration that would help them
``move into'' Iraq should Saddam be toppled, a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about lethal assistance at this time,'' the
State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There were funds for a broadcasting system that would enable the
opposition groups to get their anti-Saddam message into Iraq. As
well, the opposition would most likely open offices in London, New
York and in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the activities Monday, Rubin, said that the
administration was embarking on a new policy. ``This kind of
broad-based political regime change, overt policy, is a new
policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He described the membership of the opposition that the
administration is backing as being a ``variety'' that stretched
beyond the interests of Chalabi.
</P>
<P>
   Among those groups at the State Department Monday were the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, led by Latif Rashid, and the
Kurdistan Democratic Party, led by Hoshyar Zebari. State Department
officials said they were pleased a centrist Sunni leader in exile,
Riyad al Yawir, was present Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the meeting with Albright Monday was intended to show to
the administration that the frequently squabbling opposition
factions had patched up their differences and were reuniting in the
goal of overthrowing Saddam, a senior State Department official
said.

 &HT;    Health care industry lags on Y2K bug, experts say
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The health care industry trails other sectors in
preparing for Y2K problems and is scrambling to catch up, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret about the vulnerability of the whole health
care industry, and hospitals in particular,'' Lew Yeouze of
consulting firm William M. Mercer said Monday. ``In a hospital, so
many things are used to keep people alive,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But many hospitals had not addressed this as a big issue until
recently, Yeouze said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Pearson of GHA, an association of Georgia hospitals,
declined to comment on a recent Senate report on how health care is
running behind other industries on Y2K readiness. But he said
hospitals in the state are aggressively tackling the issue.
</P>
<P>
   GHA has been holding information sessions with its members and
has developed a list of contingency plans for hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not predicting problems,'' Pearson said, adding, ``This
is an unprecedented event.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Georgia Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, to head
off a potential Y2K problem, ordered health insurers to allow
consumers to buy a three-month supply of life-saving prescription
drugs in advance of Jan. 1. That would ensure adequate supplies
through March 31. Insurers typically pay only for a 30-day supply,
according to Oxendine's office.
</P>
<P>
   The order would pertain to life-sustaining medication such as
insulin and heart medicine. The order does not apply to Georgians
covered by employer plans that are self-insured.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem arose because computer programmers, as a
shortcut, used a two-digit code to represent the year. Unless
software is adjusted, a 00 date could mean 1900, not 2000. If not
corrected, those computers could shut down or produce incorrect
information, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Among health care organizations, hospitals have the biggest
challenge in addressing the computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   Besides their financial transactions, and their physical plants,
hospitals depend on a maze of computer systems. And computer chips
help run a variety of high-tech equipment used in medical services,
ranging from infusion pumps and respirators to CT scans and
defibrillators. Electricity and water supplies are vital as well.
</P>
<P>
   Patient care is where many hospitals have started their Y2K
work, Pearson said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a survey by the American Hospital Association to
indicate hospitals are well on their way to completing their
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   In that February survey, 85 percent of respondents said they
expect their information systems will be ready or won't be a
problem by year end, 90 percent expect their medical devices will
be ready, and 72 expect their physical plant will be compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, the state's largest
health insurer, is spending more than $15 million over 2 1/2 years
on Y2K preparedness. ``We will be ready by year end,'' said Charlie
Harman, a Blue Cross vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Medicaid program recently failed to meet state and
federal deadlines for Y2K testing. But the Department of Medical
Assistance has improved its status with federal officials, said
Mike Hale, project manager for the Year 2000 Project for the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved from a high-risk to a medium-risk category,'' he
said. Medicaid should be doing systems testing in July, Hale said.

OUT TUESDAY: NUCLEAR THRILLER WITH AN OPEN ENDING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (jw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Inside the congressional report on Chinese
espionage due out on Tuesday is a first-rate spy story. Trouble is,
no one is sure what it means.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1995, a Chinese spy walked into the CIA's arms
in Taiwan, carrying a suitcase crammed with secret documents. But
the CIA eventually decided that the man was under the control of
Chinese intelligence, sent to deliver a message whose meaning no
one has been able to translate.
</P>
<P>
   The only valuable paper in his suitcase contained evidence that
China had obtained secret information on American nuclear weapons.
Earlier that year, three scientists at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, analyzing three years' worth of data from Chinese
nuclear tests, voiced similar suspicions. Their fears and the
Chinese documents are the seeds from which the new report grew.
</P>
<P>
   The report's conclusions are blunt, say those who have read
them: China has stolen data on every significant American nuclear
warhead, the stolen secrets helped China design and test modern
nuclear weapons, and Chinese espionage at the biggest government
weapons labs is long-standing and continuing.
</P>
<P>
   But some of its underlying facts, like China's delivery of
documents to the CIA, are so complicated that they may be argued
over for years, intelligence officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with the conclusion that the Chinese stole
nuclear weapons data. ``There is no information that we have to
say, `This information is in their hands,' '' the Energy
Department's new counterintelligence chief, Edward Curran, a
respected FBI veteran, told a Senate committee four days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some Energy Department officials argue to this day that
``no espionage occurred, and if it did occur, it did not occur at
Los Alamos,'' said Notra Trulock, the department's intelligence
chief from 1994 to 1998, who strongly disagrees with that argument.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday it will be four years to the day since Trulock, the
leading whistle-blower in the case, first got wind of suspicions of
Chinese espionage at Los Alamos. And despite countless hours of
investigation and analysis since that day _ and damage assessments
by the CIA, an outside review board and the forthcoming
congressional report _ much work lies ahead, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need to do a true damage assessment,'' he said. ``We
need to think harder about what all this means.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart,
repeated official assertions that there was no proof of Chinese
espionage under the Clinton administration. ``During this
presidency,'' he said, ``I can't point to a case where we know
something was stolen, we know who did it, and we know where it went
to and we know where it came from. That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring that bottom line are facts fraught with ambiguity
and complexity.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report concludes that Chinese leaders
deliberately sent the messenger of the crucial document to the CIA
to tell the United States that China had obtained secret
information about the American nuclear arsenal, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That ``makes the case much more complicated than we knew
originally,'' said James Lilley, who was U.S. ambassador in Beijing
from 1989 to 1991 and CIA station chief there in the mid-1970s.
``It just throws a pall over this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would China would want the United States to know that it had
stolen nuclear secrets?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was to advertise Chinese nuclear advances, to prove
that the Chinese could penetrate American security systems, or to
confuse American intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   On the last point, it may have succeeded. That may in part
explain the low-key response by law enforcement to the ticking time
bomb of espionage allegations in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the crucial document in the Chinese briefcase
contained stolen information on six nuclear weapons _ the crown
jewels of the American nuclear arsenal, officials said. The theft
of information is believed to have occurred in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a decade later, long after the investigation was under way,
key intelligence and law enforcement officials focused only on one
weapon system, the W-88, not all six, the report said. They did not
mount an all-out investigation into what some politicians and
officials are calling one of the biggest spy cases in American
history. The only suspect in the case, a Los Alamos scientist named
Wen Ho Lee, has not been charged with a crime, apparently for lack
of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Such details from the forthcoming report of the bipartisan
committee, headed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., have led to
calls from key members of Congress for heads to roll, including
that of Attorney General Janet Reno. They blame her for a lax
response to charges of Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox report concludes that there is no doubt that thefts of
American secrets accelerated Chinese weapons development, officials
said. It says espionage aimed at American secrets played a central
role in China's acquisition of key nuclear designs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it also says there is no way to tell how much information
was stolen, or what effect stolen secrets may have had on the speed
of China's drive toward a modern arsenal, officials said. They said
that without hard answers _ and without a suspect under arrest _
the case was like a thriller missing its final pages.

ASIA, SLOWING RECOVERING STILL OFFERS BARGAINS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the economies of most Asian nations appearing to be slowly
on the mend, the region's airlines and hotels are no longer
practically giving away their services, as they were less than a
year ago. Nevertheless, there are still lots of travel bargains to
Asia, and travelers whose plans can accommodate midweek departures,
Saturday stays and other restrictions can save money, or at least
enjoy an array of extras.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the bargains are also beneficial to countries in the
region. ``Tourism is actually helping to stimulate economic
recovery and growth in destinations including South Korea, Thailand
and Bali,'' said Joseph A. McInerney, the chief executive of the
Pacific Asia Travel Association in Bangkok. ``In Thailand, for
example, tourist arrivals from the U.S. reached 361,705 in 1998 _ a
16.3 percent increase over 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest bargains, as usual, are those offered by the
airlines, which typically arrange package deals with tour operators
and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines, for example, is offering a Bangkok package
that includes air fare and five nights in a hotel for $669 for West
Coast departures, and $717 from New York, Boston, Chicago, Detroit,
Memphis and Minneapolis/St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   After June 30, prices rise to $809 and $845, for travel through
Aug. 31. Other Northwest packages are available for travel to Hong
Kong, Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines' tour branch, United Vacations, is offering a

in Bangkok is offering a 50 percent discount on tennis lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton Hotels in Singapore, Tokyo, Bangkok, Taipei and Beijing
have also trimmed prices modestly and added upgrades,
transportation, breakfasts and other perks. Most of the hotels will
offer the promotions at least through September.

MOYA RALLIES, BUT CHANG CAN'T AVOID THE EXIT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ On the opening day at the French Open, the clay was a
slippery place to conduct business.
</P>
<P>
   A surfeit of past and present men's champions, a couple of them
doomed to dueling each other in the first round, scrambled through
a difficult first round Monday at Roland Garros, where the balls
soaked up so much humidity that players felt as if they were
hurling bowling balls across the net.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Moya, the men's defending champion, found himself mired
in a two-sets-to-none trough before he eventually woke up and
rallied.
</P>
<P>
   The most daunting assignment was that given to Michael Chang,
ranked 50th and a creaky version of the relentlessly resilient
17-year-old who outlasted leg cramps, Ivan Lendl and Stefan Edberg
here in 1989. A decade later, Chang was not up to the task of
getting past Yevgeny Kafelnikov, currently No. 1 in the world, and
for the first time in his career failed to reach the second round
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov, the 1996 French Open champion and the reigning
Australian Open champion, put an embarrassing string of six
opening-round losses out of his mind and kept focused for the
nearly three hours he needed to dismiss Chang, 6-2, 5-7, 6-0, 7-6
(10-8).
</P>
<P>
   Chang did not leave without a fight, but after saving three
match points, he was floored by a forehand volley.
</P>
<P>
   Chang admitted he has been mulling over missionary work as his
most appropriate post-tennis profession but said he is not ready to
turn in his sneakers and turn tail on a career that has brought him
more than $17 million but never a No. 1 ranking like Kafelnikov's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing has been to pick myself back up after
losses like this, but my time's not up yet,'' the 27-year-old Chang
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Muster, the 1995 champion, who has slipped to No. 47,
also failed to survive the opening round, losing to Nicolas
Lapentti of Ecuador, 2-6, 6-1, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4).
</P>
<P>
   During his near three-hour brush with early elimination, Moya
had visions of failing to defend his title, a fate also suffered by
Boris Becker at the 1997 Australian Open and Roscoe Tanner in
Melbourne in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   But after taking only four games from 92d-ranked Markus Hipfl in
the first two sets, the fourth-seeded Moya rediscovered his poise
and his topspin and persevered for a 3-6, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4
comeback. Moya improved his five-set record at Grand Slams to 8-1,
but it was only his second reversal of a two-sets-to-none deficit.
His other recovery came at Chang's expense at the 1998 United
States Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I was playing, I didn't see any way to escape from
this match,'' Moya said. ``But I just kept fighting. I run at all
the balls. What can you do when you're losing so badly? You just
have to do your best and pray, and that's what I did and it worked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya next faces Petr Korda, last year's Australian Open
champion. Korda has been accused of steroid use by the
International Tennis Federation and, pending the outcome of an
appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, this could be the
31-year-old Czech's final French Open.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi, a scant month after receiving his divorce decree
from the actress Brooke Shields, stormed into the second round with
a 3-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-3 comeback against Franco Squillari of
Argentina. Always a fan of the grand gesture, the 13th-seeded
Agassi finished off the match with three consecutive aces.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, the defending champion, Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario, breezed by Croatia's Mirjana Lucic, 6-2, 6-2, and both
Williams sisters reached the second round with similar ease. The
fifth-seeded Venus trounced Alexandra Fusai, 6-1, 6-1, and the
10th-seeded Serena overpowered Laurence Courtois, 6-4, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Top-seeded Martina Hingis, who is eager to correct the fact that
she has won every Grand Slam event except the French Open, downed
Amanda Hopkins, 6-1, 6-4, to set up a second-round match with
Amelie Mauresmo of France.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a dangerous player; I'll take her serious,'' Hingis said
of the 18th-ranked Mauresmo, the player she defeated in the final
of the 1999 Australia Open.
</P>
<P>
   After Mauresmo announced in Melbourne that she is gay, Hingis
blithely referred to her as ``half a man.'' The French teen-ager
got her revenge a month later at the Paris Indoors, a defeat Hingis
played down as ``not a huge loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauresmo said the sting of the comments about her personal life
made by Hingis had not worn off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since people are still talking about it, it still exists,''
Mauresmo said. ``My motivation will be at a maximum. Now I know
that I can beat her. I have no pressure.''

   The upper house of Parliament approved contentious legislation
strengthening military cooperation with Washington. The law will

MERRILL LYNCH TO USE INTERNET FOR ADVISING CLIENTS AND BOND
TRADING
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch, criticized for a go-slow approach to
online trading for consumers, is trying to stay ahead of the
Internet curve when it comes to its core corporate and
institutional clients.
</P>
<P>
   The securities firm has created a new group, called Direct
Markets, that will distribute Merrill's research and investment
advice over the World Wide Web. Clients will be able to trade some
bonds on the Internet, and Merrill says online underwriting is not
far off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the attention in the Internet world is directed toward
the retail side,'' Thomas W. Davis, an executive vice president who
heads the firm's capital markets group, said in an interview. ``But
as we look at the landscape, we see technology creating
considerable change on the institutional side as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's online push is intended to ward off competition from
upstarts that promise lower costs and more direct ways for large
fund managers, like mutual and pension funds and corporations with
big investment pools, to trade stocks, bonds and options through
the Internet. Merrill also has taken stakes in companies like
Optimark, a stock trading service for institutional investors, and
Tradeweb, a similar service for bond traders, Merrill officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are approached once a day by some organization that's the
latest and greatest facilitator of market activity,'' said G. Kelly
Martin, who heads Merrill's debt operations. ``We think we have a
lot to offer these people. As these markets mature, we anticipate
playing a bigger role in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as stock trading by individual investors has exploded, the
biggest stock and bond traders, who tend to be sensitive to how
well their trade orders are executed and the benefits they get from
close ties to an investment bank, have been slower to embrace new
trading companies. But Merrill seems eager to prevent the
defections it had from its consumer client base when rivals like
Charles Schwab and ETrade began offering a full array of brokerage
services at much lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to meet and exceed competitive offerings,'' Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill has begun offering electronic trading and research
services for some products. They include online tools for managing
clients' commercial paper, United States government and agency
bonds, and repurchase agreements. Information and trading of stock,
bond and commodity derivatives is already available. Select clients
will also have electronic access to Merrill's offerings of new debt
issues, the firm said in an internal memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   The offerings seem more evolutionary than revolutionary. Some
big Merrill clients say they have long received research on line.
Trading through the Internet can be useful for small buy and sell
orders, some said, but most clients want brokers to walk them
through placement of larger orders, particularly in volatile
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of the smaller orders, on line is great _ less
nuisance, lower cost,'' said Barbara Kenworthy, a bond fund manager
for Prudential Securities. But, she said, bond markets other than
for United States Treasury bonds are too unstable to execute large
trades automatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are trying to trade sizable blocks, you need to really
get the flavor of the market,'' she said. ``For that, you need that
relationship with your banker.'' &QL;

 &HT;    400 million ancestors hit Web as Mormons go online
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The hunt for your ancestors may have just gotten
easier.
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon Church on Monday introduced FamilySearch, a World
Wide Web site that contains nearly 400 million names. Internet
users can search the site for records of their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Online resources such as this one have helped popularize
genealogy by making information more readily available. There are
many online databases that can help researchers trace their family
trees, but the Mormon site has far more names, says April Helm,
co-author of ``Genealogy Online for Dummies'' (IDG, $24.99).
</P>
<P>
   FamilySearch contains information drawn from a century of record
gathering by the church, which possesses the largest genealogical
database in the world. Previously, researchers could search those
records only at local family history centers _ there are 14 in
metro Atlanta _ or at the Family History Library in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The FamilySearch site attracted more than 200 million hits
during a two-month test, and it bogged down in heavy traffic as
word spread Monday. Some visitors weren't able to visit the site,
which had drawn 30 million hits as of 11 a.m. The site will be
expanded to accommodate 100 million hits per day, said Elder Monte
J. Brough of Lilburn, a former executive director of the church's
Family History Department. Brough conceived the project five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the site is free for everyone, Mormon or not. ``I
don't care where you come from or what your background is, I think
we've got something you can use and enjoy,'' Brough said.
</P>
<P>
   The church spent an undisclosed amount of money to put its
records online. In the next two years it plans to add more names,
bringing the total to 1 billion people in 110 countries, Brough
said.
</P>
<P>
   The site also offers access to the Family History Library in
Salt Lake City and records of some 32 million people with pedigrees
_ information on several generations of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The church _ formally known as the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints _ encourages members to trace their family roots
so they can baptize ancestors by proxy. Mormons believe that the
dead can choose their faith in the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   The church unveiled the Internet site at press conferences in
Atlanta, Washington and Salt Lake City.

COMMENTARY: A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So here's my question for the day: Why is it (beyond issues of
personal character) that Mikhail Gorbachev, Bill Clinton, Benjamin
Netanyahu and Tony Blair engender so much passion, hatred and
adulation from their supporters and detractors?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, I would suggest, has to do with the fact that during
the 1990s the world shifted from one international system to
another. We have moved from a Cold War system, built around
division and walls, to a globalization system built around
integration and Webs. For every major country, moving between these
two systems involves crossing a Rubicon, and one of the reasons
that Gorby, Bibi, Tony and Bill have gotten under people's skins so
much has to do with the controversial strategies they each used to
cross this daunting river.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, they all share reputations for being dishonest
(Blair the least of all, but then he's just getting started!),
earned in part because the political coalitions they used to come
to power at the tail end of the Cold War system had to be
jettisoned in favor of different coalitions required for governing
in the new system.
</P>
<P>
   The man who faced the widest Rubicon was Gorbachev. The gulf
between the Communist Cold War system and the free-market
globalization system was the mother of all Rubicons. ``The only
reason Gorbachev was able to manage that transition as long as he
did, as peacefully as he did, was because he didn't realize how
wide the Rubicon really was,'' remarked Michael Mandelbaum, a Johns
Hopkins University foreign policy specialist. ``Gorbachev thought
he could cross the river in one leap, and when he discovered that
wasn't possible, he thought he could walk on water.''
</P>
<P>
   Once it became apparent how much change would actually be
required, Gorbachev found himself without friends _ his old
Communist allies despised him for doing too much, and his natural
allies, such as Boris Yeltsin, dismissed him for doing too little.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu came to power riding a coalition of people who were
wary of the Oslo peace process, but he soon discovered that he
could not govern without advancing Oslo. Too many Israelis didn't
want to live in a world of walls, but wanted to be integrated in
the broad trends of both the region and the globe, which the Oslo
process represented. Bibi's strategy was to swim laps in the
Rubicon. He crossed the river in some important ways by signing the
Hebron and Wye agreements, but then crossed back, when he
confronted the wrath of his original right-wing constituency. He
never stayed on one bank long enough to be trusted by either his
right-wing core or the centrist coalition supporting Oslo _ and he
never really tried to build a bridge between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's strategy was to cross the Rubicon by filling in
most of the river. That is, he absorbed the best of Republican
ideas _ welfare reform, deficit reduction, free trade, missile
defense _ and then left the Republicans with being anti-abortion
and pro-guns. (He left the GOP as the party that is ready to defend
the life of every unborn child, but willing to risk the life of
every born adult.) So the Rubicon between Democrats and Republicans
is now mostly filled in, but the remaining divide is very deep.
Clinton roams around with ease, while the Republicans sit over on
their bank stewing at him and trying to figure out how to widen the
river again.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair's Rubicon between the Cold War and globalization is
whether to bring Britain into the European Monetary Union, which he
clearly seems inclined to do, even though this is a hugely divisive
issue. For now, Blair is dog paddling in his Rubicon, postponing
the decision on joining Europe until the next election, after which
he will probably hold a national referendum _ in hopes that this
will be his bridge from one side of the river to the other. One
reason for Blair's tough stance on Kosovo may be to highlight
British leadership and his own nationalist credentials at a time
when he may be preparing to obscure both by merging Britain into
Europe. The more Blair prepares to abandon the British pound, the
more he speaks like Winston Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Gorby, Blair knows his Rubicon cannot be crossed in one
leap, and unlike Bibi, he actually has a strategy for bridging the
two sides. But this river between Britain and Europe is a roiling
one, and Blair best not make Gorby's mistake of thinking that he
can walk on water.(BOX)

VIETNAM'S GRAFT TRIALS DAZZLE THE PUBLIC, BUT GRAFT REMAINS

   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ Just before a huge corruption trial
began here this month with 77 defendants, including powerful
bankers and business executives, local reporters were taken aside
and handed envelopes of cash worth more than a month's pay.
</P>
<P>
   According to one reporter, who wrote about the incident in his
newspaper, Tuoi Tre, a top official of a bank that employs 16
defendants gave each reporter the equivalent of $150 and suggested
they limit their articles to narrow accounts of court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In two years the government has been engaged in a major
anticorruption drive, highlighted by a series of ever-larger trials
that have resulted in 12 death sentences. The cases are the talk of
the country. Overflow crowds are gathering to hear testimony over
loudspeakers outside the current trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the cash envelopes raised few eyebrows. Far from being
capital crimes, such gestures are simply part of day-to-day life.
As in a number of neighboring countries, the tortuous and
multilayered bureaucracy of Vietnam and its low-paid public workers
and police officers provide fertile ground for a culture of
payoffs. ``It's the weak point of our system,'' a schoolteacher who
is following the trials said. ``It's an illness of Southeast Asia,
to try to get rich on the back of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   A doctor who insisted on anonymity said: ``I'm not sure how much
effect trials like this will have because corruption is all around
is. It's a way of life. Everyone knows that if you need some
documentation or need to get something out of customs, it will cost
a little something. Parents pay to get their children into good
schools. Some hospitals expect something on the side to treat
patients. On rural roads, you see trucks lined up waiting to pay
off the police, so they can go on their way.''
</P>
<P>
   As the economy has opened over 10 years, opportunities for big
payoffs have multiplied, part of the unbridled capitalism that has
surged through other newly open economies like Russia's.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign executives report having been told they would have to
pay six-figure or even seven-figure bribes to secure major
contracts. It is common for foreign companies to hire local
``consultants,'' whose chief asset is personal connections to
important officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Communist Party leader, Le Ka Phieu, expressed
his concern, saying, ``Wasteful behavior, embezzlement and
corruption are not merely economic, but ethical issues that become
political.''
</P>
<P>
   High-profile corruption trials have picked up their pace this
year. In one, 74 defendants were convicted, and two were sentenced
to death, for being in a national smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, 35 people, including 29 local officials, were
sentenced to up to 20 years in prison for a logging swindle.
</P>
<P>
   The trial that started on May 10 involves a shell game in which
two companies, Minh Phung and Epco, are said to have colluded with
bankers to obtain huge loans using phantom collateral. Prosecutors
say the scheme cost the government up to $280 million, more than
budget revenue for Ho Chi Minh City last year. The scope of the
trial is enormous, involving 54 defense lawyers, nearly 300
witnesses and an indictment that took four days to read.
</P>
<P>
   Along with company executives, the defendants include 18 former
officers of state banks, as well as six public officials.

FIRST LADY STUMPS IN NEW YORK, RAISES CASH FOR SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton launched preparations for a
possible Senate campaign in New York on Monday, raising more than
$1 million for the Democratic candidate who will seek to succeed
retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady laid out the broad themes of her own would-be
Senate campaign and praised Rep. Nita Lowey, the Democrat who has
vowed to seek the Senate seat if Clinton does not.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, while not directly addressing her own political plans,
talked about education, child care and leadership. Leadership, she
said, ``comes through persuasion'' and efforts ``to bring people
together rather than things that push us apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of all the progress we have made, we cannot be
complacent,'' Clinton told some 500 guests who paid $1,000 each to
benefit Lowey's campaign in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recounted her experience visiting Kosovo refugees in
Macedonia last week and her visit with President Clinton to
Littleton, Colo., the site of a school shooting that left 15 people
dead. ``We have work to do at home as well,'' the first lady
declared. ``Too many children have seen too much violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to more to help every child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton raised the money during a whirlwind evening that
included an appearance at a book party for Matilda Cuomo, wife of
former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, and receipt of an award from
Americans for the Arts, an advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aides said the first lady's ninth visit to the Empire
State since Jan. 1 is the latest step in her effort to reach a
decision by mid-June on establishing an exploratory committee for a
Senate campaign _ the first by a sitting first lady in American
history.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the fund-raiser for Lowey, Clinton mingled at a private
home in Manhattan with more than 50 guests who had paid $10,000
each to raise more than $500,000 for the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee to be used by the party's candidate for Senate
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud to march forward shoulder to shoulder with my
friend, Hillary Rodham Clinton,'' Lowey said. ``We are united and
we are confidant that on Nov. 7, 2000, New York will elect its
first woman to the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know yet who will lead our march,'' she said, ``but I
do know the road. I am proud to walk it with Hillary and with each
of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowey has promised to leave her six-term seat in Congress
representing well-to-do Westchester County, north of New York City,
and run for the Senate if Clinton foregoes the race.
</P>
<P>
   Lowey could use the money raised at the fund-raiser either for
re-election to the House or for the Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you one thing, the next senator from New York will
be a woman,'' Lowey said in a broadcast interview Sunday. ``If
Hillary Clinton runs, she will win. If I run, I will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, a Democrat, is retiring next year at the end of his
fourth term in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance at the Lowey fund-raiser appeared designed
in part to soothe private grumbling by some local Democrats who
have quietly raised concerns about the impact that Clinton's
flirtation with a Senate race is having on the fortunes of
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Lowey defended Clinton's gradual exploration of a Senate bid in
an interview on ABC News' ``This Week.'' Lowey said she believed
New Yorkers would be more concerned about the substance of a
Democratic Senate candidacy than the person's origins.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was born in Illinois, educated at Wellesley College in
suburban Boston and Yale Law School in New Haven, Conn., and became
active in politics during her husband's 12 years as governor of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think New Yorkers care what you stand for, rather than where
you're from,'' Lowey said, defending the first lady's possible
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's arrival in New York coincided with fresh evidence that
she will have a tough fight on her hands for a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate exploratory committee of New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani welcomed the first lady with a message on the campaign's
Web site, www.HillaryNo.com, saying: ``Hillary can't stay away from
New York City.'' The statement added: ``The U.S. Senate is a place
for proven leaders, not a proving ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., said in a broadcast interview on Sunday
that he was ``inching closer and closer'' to challenging Giuliani
for the Republican nomination for the Senate. Lazio, who has
represented a Long Island congressional district for eight years,
criticized both Clinton and Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have somebody in New York representing New York
interests who is looking for this as a platform for power and not
watching out for New York. ... We need to have a New Yorker
represent New York,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said Giuliani was ``a reluctant Republican'' who had
endorsed Mario Cuomo over Republican challenger George Pataki in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's comments raised the possibility of a bitter GOP primary
fight for the Senate nomination, a contest that could strengthen
Clinton's chances.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States and Uzbekistan have quietly negotiated and are
expected to sign a bilateral agreement Tuesday to provide American
aid in dismantling and decontaminating one of the former Soviet
Union's largest chemical weapons testing facilities, according to
Defense Department and Uzbek officials.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Pentagon informed Congress that it
intends to spend up to $6 million under its Cooperative Threat
Reduction program to demilitarize the so-called Chemical Research
Institute, in Nukus, Uzbekistan. Soviet defectors and American
officials say that the Nukus plant was the major research testing
site for a new class of secret, highly lethal chemical weapons
called ``Novichok,'' which in Russian means ``new guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to help Uzbekistan clean up the plant is part of
wide-ranging cooperation between Uzbekistan and Washington since
the former Soviet republic became independent in 1991. On Monday,
American and Uzbek officials opened a series of meetings in
Tashkent, the Uzbek capital.
</P>
<P>
   Uzbek officials said in interviews earlier this year that, only
after their country became independent, did they come to understand
the legacy of pollution that had resulted from their designated
role as the Soviet Union's major testing ground for chemical and
biological weapons. ``We were shocked when we first learned the
real picture,'' said Isan Mustafoev, Uzbekistan's deputy foreign
minister, in an interview in Tashkent last March.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the health and environmental impact of the Soviets'
use of Uzbekistan for the production and large-scale testing of
illegal chemical and germ weapons, Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan's
president, renounced weapons of mass destruction. Since then, his
government has worked closely with American defense officials,
granting them access to sites whose counterparts in Russia are
still off limits.
</P>
<P>
   The Chemical Research Institute, which is in a closed military
complex in Nukus in the semi-autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan,
is a case in point. Uzbek officials said they were still uncertain
what kind of chemical agents, or how many, were made and tested
here and elsewhere on Uzbek soil.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has refused to disclose the information, Uzbek officials
complain, and some international arms inspectors have said there is
no proof that the Nukus plant was used to produce chemical weapons,
now banned.
</P>
<P>
   After touring the plant last year, inspectors from the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the agency
based in the Hague, Netherlands, that oversees the 1993 treaty
banning chemical weapons, concluded that the institute may have
tested weapons but was not a production site.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafoev, of the Uzbek Foreign Ministry, scoffed at the
finding, arguing that there was plenty of evidence of such work at
the lab that the Soviets built in 1986, closed to all but the
Russian scientists who worked there, and abandoned only in 1992.
American officials agreed, noting that a senior defector from the
Soviet chemical weapons program, Vil Mirzayanov, who worked for
more than 25 years in the Soviet chemical weapons program, had told
them and later said publicly that the plant was built to produce
small batches, for testing, of Novichok binary weapons, designed to
escape detection by international inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Islamov Abushair, the commander of the Uzbek military base
in Nukus, highlighted what he called evidence of the secret Soviet
chemical weapons program as he escorted a reporter recently on a
rare tour of the plant, now closed. As the Soviet Union was
crumbling, he explained, the more than 300 scientists at the plant
packed up their deadly chemicals, their most sensitive equipment,
manuals and their test results, and left.
</P>
<P>
   Shards of brown, glass laboratory bottles littered the plant's
floors, and the icy air of an early spring rushed through broken
windows. In one room stood a large test chamber into which small
animals were once placed for testing.
</P>
<P>
   Another room contained treadmills for dogs and dozens of testing
harnesses, to cram dogs' muzzles into gas masks, leaving their
bodies exposed. The device enabled scientists to expose either the
dog's skin, or lungs, to lethal chemical agents, Uzbek and American
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the monstrous rubbish they left us,'` said Islamov,
whose battalion of Uzbek soldiers now occupies the apartments in
which elite Russian scientists and their families used to live.
</P>
<P>
   Islamov and other Uzbek officials said that their country lacked
the money to decontaminate and convert the plant and stop the
pollution caused by accidents, poor safety procedures and the
disposal and dumping of chemical wastes and discarded weapons. A
Pentagon official said Monday that the United States would help
Uzbekistan dismantle and decontaminate the complex ``to prohibit
the proliferation of equipment from this pilot-scale production
facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Information is slowly emerging about the hundreds of open-air
chemical tests performed not only at the Nukus plant but also on
the neighboring Usyurt Plateau in the Turgay Steppe, an equally
inhospitable desert several hundred miles west of the Aral Sea,
which Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan share.
</P>
<P>
   Uzbek and American bio-warfare experts said that in 1988
thousands of antelope dropped dead on the plateau when the wind
unexpectedly shifted during one of the chemical tests. Their
carcasses are still buried in a pit on the range, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet-run animal research institute in Tashkent once
produced snake- and spider-venom weapons for the KGB's
assassination program, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdusattor Abdukarimov, director of the Institute of Genetics
and Plant Experimental Biology in Tashkent, now a civilian plant,
said that in Soviet times it produced wheat pathogens and other
microbes to attack plants.

PROSECUTORS SEEK TO DROP CHARGES BROUGHT BY TWO N.J. TROOPERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ Acting in what they called ``the interests of
justice,'' prosecutors have moved to drop drug and weapons charges
filed against 21 drivers by two New Jersey state troopers who have
been accused of lying about the race of other drivers they had
stopped and searched.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed last Friday in New Brunswick, the Middlesex
County prosecutor's office said the 21 cases should be dismissed
because they were undermined by an April 19 indictment that charged
that the troopers, John Hogan and James Kenna, falsified records to
cover up the fact that they were targeting black and Hispanic
drivers for stops. Of the 21 drivers whose cases could be
dismissed, at least 19 are either black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robert A. Longhi of New Jersey Superior Court has
scheduled a hearing on the motion Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, he throws out the cases, it would represent one
of the most dramatic results of the state attorney general's
ongoing investigation into charges that some state troopers have
for years singled out black and Hispanic motorists for stops,
particularly on the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say that the state's willingness to drop these
cases, in which all the drivers were stopped or arrested by Hogan
and Kenna, could lead to challenges to overturn dozens of past
convictions of minority motorists who were arrested by the two or
by other troopers who may have practiced profiling. At the time
Hogan and Kenna were indicted, state investigators said that as
many as 10 other troopers could face criminal charges of falsifying
records.
</P>
<P>
   William Buckman, a Moorestown lawyer who has helped lead the
legal fight against profiling, said he believed the attorney
general's office has an ethical and legal obligation to share with
defense lawyers any new evidence of discriminatory stops that led
to conviction of black or Hispanic motorists. Buckman also said he
expected those convicted in the past will file appeals on grounds
the state withheld evidence of profiling or their lawyers did not
raise the issue during trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Buckman cautioned that overturning convictions is difficult
in New Jersey. ``Some judge are more hostile to re-opening
convictions than others,'' Buckman said. ``That's the wildcard
that's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan and Kenna made the 21 arrests in the months before April
1998 when they opened fire on four young black and Hispanic men
riding in a van they had stopped on the turnpike. Three of the
van's passengers were wounded. A state grand jury is considering
filing criminal charges against the troopers for the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a different grand jury accused the two troopers of
falsifying official documents and reporting that black and Hispanic
drivers they had stopped were white. Both were suspended from the
state police without pay immediately after the indictment. They
face arraignment on those charges Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the motion filed last Friday, Lawrence R. West, first
assistant Middlesex County prosecutor, said the two troopers were
``necessary and essential witnesses'' against the 21 individuals.
West said the charges they had lied on official records prompted
his office to seek dismissal of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Davis, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, said
officials there agreed with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the primary witnesses in each case, and they would
have lacked any kind of credibility,'' Davis said of Hogan and
Kenna.
</P>
<P>
   The move to dismiss the cases comes nearly six months after the
attorney general's office convinced state judges to suspend
prosecution of these 21 individuals and 9 others who had been
either stopped or arrested by Hogan or Kenna.
</P>
<P>
   The state asked that the cases be suspended after a Trenton
lawyer, Robin Kay Lord, started a court fight in Mercer County to
obtain Hogan's personnel file and any evidence that he had engaged
in profiling. Ms. Lord wanted the material to help defend two black
men whom the two troopers arrested on drug charges in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The state argued that surrendering the documents would
jeopardize the ongoing grand jury investigation of the van
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Two judges granted the state's motion, and suspended prosecution
of Ms. Lord's two clients in Mercer County and 28 others in
Middlesex County from Dec. 11 to April 11. The state allowed the
suspension period to lapse about a week before the trooper
indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, judges in Mercer County dismissed drug
charges against Ms. Lord's two clients.
</P>
<P>
   Seven defendants in the 28 Middlesex cases are not involved in
the current dismissal motion. West said that some pleaded guilty
during the suspension period and that troopers other that Hogan and
Kenna will testify against the others.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 people whose cases not may be dropped in New Brunswick
include a television producer, Michael G. Moye, whom Hogan charged
with illegal weapons possession after stopping his van on the
turnpike in early 1998. Moye said the weapons, two handguns and a
shotgun, were legally purchased and registered and part of a
collection he was transferring from his home in California to his
home in Greenwich, Conn. He said he told Hogan about the guns but
was arrested because two were loaded.

   WEIMAR, Texas _ A suspect in the slaying of a Houston-area
doctor was named Monday as a suspect in the killings of a Weimar
minister and his wife after authorities linked evidence at both
crime scenes, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, a 38-year-old Mexican national who has
a 20-year criminal record in Texas, California, Florida, New Mexico
and other states, is now wanted for questioning in the murders of
the Rev.
</P>
<P>
   Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 46, and his wife, Karen, 47. The couple
was found beaten to death with a sledgehammer in the parsonage
behind the Weimar United Church of Christ when they failed to show
up for services May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez also has been charged with burglary and is a
suspect in last December's sexual assault and murder of Dr. Claudia
Benton, 39, a Baylor College of Medicine physician who was found
dead Dec. 17 in her home in West University Place, a Houston
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Her body was found on the floor in an upstairs bedroom. A bloody
kitchen knife from the home was near the body. The autopsy report
showed that she had suffered three stab wounds and at least 19
blows to the head with a heavy statue, and had been sexually
assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez became a suspect in the West University case
when his fingerprint was lifted from pieces of a broken steering
column from Benton's Jeep Cherokee, which had been stolen and later
recovered in San Antonio. Last week, workers at the Texas
Department of Public Safety Crime Lab analyzed samples from the
West University crime scene and linked them to those from the
Sirnics' home in Weimar, a town of 2,050 about 90 miles west of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Weimar authorities plan to issue warrants for Resendez-Ramirez's
arrest today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's imperative that we locate this individual as soon
as possible,'' said Weimar Police Chief Bill Livingston.
``Hopefully someone will have some idea where he may be.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston and West University Police Chief Gary M. Brye said
similarities between the two cases prompted them to compare
physical evidence, but they declined to say what specific evidence
made them suspect Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the victims were attacked in their homes at night,
with the killer entering through a garage or carport. All the
victims were beaten to death in their bedrooms and the murder
weapon was left at the scene. And both homes were located near
railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The West University police description of Resendez-Ramirez
notes: ``Suspect may be living as a transient working odd jobs and
riding the rails.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this seems a little far-fetched and you wonder, `How
did you guys get together?''' Livingston said. ``But we were
following every clue through to the hilt. Any similarity, any tie,
we were checking out.''
</P>
<P>
   DPS officials worked all weekend to compare the physical
evidence in the two cases and found it consistent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez is described as 5-foot-6, 150 pounds, with
brown eyes and black hair. Brye said he has used numerous aliases
throughout his criminal career, which has included arrests for
property crimes, auto theft and criminal trespass.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also are still searching for the Sirnics' 1998 red
Mazda pickup, with Texas plates 2DK-J47, which was stolen from
their driveway the weekend they were found dead in their bed.

DEA CHIEF ANNOUNCES HIS RESIGNATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Va.)   (jw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 39 years in law enforcement, Thomas Constantine abruptly
announced Monday that he would step down as the administrator of
the Drug Enforcement Administration, which he has headed since
March 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine said his decision was not motivated by political
considerations. Now 60 years old, he said, he wants to return to
New York and spend more time with his family. But he has disagreed,
sometimes forcefully, with the rest of the Clinton administration's
portrayal of Mexico as a full ally in fighting the flow of drugs
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics
Control on Feb. 24, Constantine asserted that Mexican drug
trafficking organizations posed the worst criminal threat to the
nation that he had seen in nearly 40 years in law enforcement. Two
days later, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared that
Mexico was cooperating fully with the United States in
drug-fighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine's readiness to assail Mexico's record on drugs set
him well apart from other senior administration officials. But Gen.
Barry McCaffrey, the White House director of national drug control
policy, who supported certifying Mexico, praised Constantine
effusively Monday for ``his dedication, persistence, seriousness
and integrity.'' McCaffrey said, ``He did a superb job as the
nation's top drug cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Constantine, who said he had planned to announce his retirement
last month, expects to leave office by July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense with these things is to make it as quick as you can,
and as short a time between when you announce it and you actually
go,'' Constantine said in an interview at the headquarters of the
federal drug agency in Arlington, Va. He added, ``What was also
important for me was a strong reputation for integrity. I wanted to
be able to leave here with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to go into details.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine was superintendent of the New York State Police,
when President Clinton appointed him head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration on March 11, 1994. As administrator he added more
than 1,100 agents, raising the agency's total strength to more than
9,000 agents and supporting employees.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said that Constantine had ``made an enormous
difference'' in refocusing the agency to give more assistance to
local sheriffs and police chiefs who were fighting drug trafficking
in their areas. This involved dispatching teams agents, who
arrested more than 8,000 suspected drug traffickers around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Under Constantine, the drug agency also helped the Colombian
police dismantle the Cali drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine's successor has not been named. A likely candidate
is the agency's deputy administrator, Donnie Marshall, a veteran
agent who was previously the chief of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine said he hoped to return to New York to teach and to
consult for law enforcement organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is totally and completely a personal decision,'' he said,
but then hinted at a sense of isolation in Washington. ``I probably
could have stuck around to the end of this administration,'' he
said, ``but it would be disingenuous.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Taft claims Ohio 'at disadvantage' when bidding for large jobs
 &HT;    By Michael Wagner and William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ A lot of states would have loved to snatch away
the new $300 million diesel engine factory and its 700 jobs from
the Dayton, Ohio area last year.
</P>
<P>
   Moraine was always considered the front-runner to land the
project from the General Motors Corp. and Isuzu Motors Ltd., but it
wasn't a done deal until the auto giants finished adding up their
big-ticket costs.
</P>
<P>
   Labor, material, and equipment were the biggest costs, but so
too was the plant's expected electric bill.
</P>
<P>
   Moraine won the bid, but Gov. Bob Taft and other backers of a
bill that would deregulate Ohio's $11 billion electric industry say
Ohio is now at a disadvantage when competing for large industrial
projects. That's because several other states already have
deregulation and potentially cheaper power costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electric and all utility costs are a huge factor when
companies like GM or Delphi Automotive are considering building or
relocating plants,'' said David Cole, director of the University of
Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. ``The
cheaper the electric bill the better chance a community like Dayton
has to keep or expand its automotive job base.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft will be in Dayton today to speak to the Dayton Area Chamber
of Commerce about the importance of deregulation and its potential
impact on regions such as the Miami Valley that rely heavily on
large energy users.
</P>
<P>
   Large users could see a significant energy savings under the
bill as written, and the governor expects deregulation to be a big
factor in retaining jobs.
</P>
<P>
   His visit comes in the middle of what Senate President Richard
Finan, R-Cincinnati, called the ``fifth inning'' of efforts to
enact legislation deregulating the state's electric industry. The
Senate approved the legislation last week and the House is now
considering the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (deregulation) is the largest single economic development
issue for the governor,'' said Scott Borgemenke, Taft's chief
policy adviser. ``It's kind of a new marketplace across the country
and nobody knows how the deregulated marketplace is going to shake
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Delphi and GM, which operate nine plants with about 18,000
workers in the Miami Valley, spend about $50 million annually on
utility costs with a sizeable portion going for electric power.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide they pay $130 million annually for electricity. Under
deregulation, they would shave $10 million to $15 million of that
annual cost, according to Delphi officials.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason GM, Delphi and the state's other large
industrial customers appear to be faring well in the political
fight for deregulation in the Ohio General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The deregulation bill would allow Ohioans to pick their electric
suppliers as of Jan. 1, 2001. For residential customers, it
provides a reduction of about 2 percent off their electric bills,
as well as the hope competition will further lower their monthly
bills.
</P>
<P>
   The savings would be much greater for large industrial users. In
an open marketplace, the big customers could buy power from the
cheapest supplier, technically anywhere in the nation. The current
bill provides big business with advantages that include:
</P>
<P>
   A flat tax that's applied to their total electric bill, while
other customers would still have to pay the more expensive per
kilowatt tax. The flat tax is expected to save large industrial
operations millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The chance to choose their electric supplier from the first day
of deregulation while residents wait until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The option of renewing special-rate contracts for up to 10 years
at the same electric cost or shopping the market for an even
cheaper electric supplier.
</P>
<P>
   The state's privately owned utility companies oppose the
deregulation bill, and say its benefits for big business will be
paid for by residential and small business customers, and by
utility shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that the legislative process for this bill
has consistently catered to the demands of large industrial energy
users. Utility costs are a factor, but not the biggest factor in
locating a business in Ohio,'' said Robert Snyder, executive vice
president of the Ohio Electric Utility Institute which represents
the state's major, private utilities, including Dayton Power &AMP;
Light Co.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the utilities say the bill limits their ability to
recover ``stranded costs'' _ state-approved investments they made
decades ago in nuclear power plants and other expensive projects.
The recovery would be in the form of a customer tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would give the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio authority to determine how much money each utility can get
back. Statewide, stranded cost estimates have been as high as $14
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups who are also opposed to the current legislation
say industry and utilities' gain will be converted into a loss for
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point there is nothing good for consumers,'' said
Jennifer O'Donnell, spokeswoman for Ohio Citizen Action. ``They
threw in this nickel-and-dime rate cut which would evaporate
quickly in exchange for handing over billions and billions to
utilities and give them a deregulated monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said the bill contains language that lets consumers
form buying groups to negotiate for lower costs. However, the
language requires local governments that want to form a buying
group to recruit members ``one by one.'' This approach has already
failed in California and Pennsylvania, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A better approach would be to let a local government declare
itself a ``buying group'' and all residents are members. Individual
residents could withdraw if they did not want to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to fight tooth and nail,'' O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial legislation is now going through the Ohio
House Public Utilities committee and could reach the House floor by
the second week of June. House Speaker Jo Ann Davidson,
R-Reynoldsburg, doesn't expect the lobbying from industry, the
utilities and consumer groups to go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure will come from all sides,'' she said.

 &HT;    Court sends Ohio fraud lawsuit back to Columbus for trial
 &HT;    By Steve Bennish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A U.S. appeals court in Cincinnati Friday
reinstated a lawsuit accusing state officials of defrauding the
government by not reporting the abuse of federal anti-poverty
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals returned fired state
employee Terry Wilkins' lawsuit to the U.S. District in Columbus,
which had dismissed it in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, a former top administrator for the Ohio Department of
Development, said state officials overlooked poverty agency
misspending _ including local alleged misdeeds at the now defunct
Montgomery County Community Action Agency _ to keep federal money
flowing to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 Dayton Daily News series found agencies around Ohio
misspent hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer funds on
luxury autos for executives, complex real estate deals that put
properties in private hands and programs that did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   With the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision, the case
returns to federal judge Joseph P. Kinneary in Columbus. Wilkins,
who headed the Office of Community Services, said his First
Amendment rights were violated when he was fired in 1993 after
pursuing persistent problems at the agencies. Kinneary now has the
option of scheduling the case for a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruling said that a Wilkins' lawsuit filed in
1993 was dismissed on purely technical grounds without a ruling on
its actual merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been six years,'' Wilkins' attorney Sandy Spater said
Monday. ``We'd like it to go to trial so we can have our day in
court. It's extremely important. The merits of the case have never
been considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Beougher, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General's
office, said the office had just received the appeals court opinion
and is considering options.
</P>
<P>
   One estimate placed MCCAA's unpaid debts at $3 million when it
folded in October 1997, including $1.1 million claimed by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services.

JUSTICES RULE SCHOOLS CAN BE HELD LIABLE IN STUDENT HARASSMENT
CASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE LASH  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A divided Supreme Court ruled Monday that school
boards can be held liable under federal law for ignoring severe
sexual harassment of one student by another.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision, the high court said Title IX of the 1972
Education Amendments requires school administrators to take action
when they discover ``severe, pervasive and objectively offensive''
harassment that interferes with a student's ability to learn. The
dissenting justices, however, assailed the court for potentially
turning adolescent sexual teasing into a federal case and
subjecting schools to costly and protracted litigation.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case was whether Title IX, which requires
schools receiving federal funds to provide equal education
facilities for boys and girls, demands that administrators take
steps to prevent students from sexually harassing fellow pupils at
school.
</P>
<P>
   The court revived a lawsuit brought by Aurelia Davis, the mother
of a fifth-grade girl who claims the Monroe County, Ga., Board of
Education violated Title IX by refusing to stop a fifth-grade boy
from groping and makInn lewd comments to her daughter, LaShonda.
The mother said that she and her daughter told teachers of the
alleged harassment but that the instructors did nothing and in one
instance required LaShonda to sit next to the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, agreeing with a trial
court, ruled that Title IX does not apply to sexual harassment
between students, even when teachers know of the malicious
behavior. The justices, overruling the 11th Circuit, sent Aurelia
Davis' lawsuit back for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Groups representing school boards and teachers hailed the high
court's ruling, saying it will safeguard students from harassment
while protecting administrators from liability, so long as they
don't ignore harassment in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``School boards across the country have developed or are in the
process of developing tough and clear sexual harassment policies
that demonstrate that such action will not be tolerated,'' said
Anne Bryant, executive director of the National School Boards
Association. ``Today's court ruling shows that if school officials
implement these guidelines, children should not be vulnerable to
harassment, and schools, with limited public funding, should not be
vulnerable to huge monetary damages.''
</P>
<P>
   The NSBA's reaction to the decision is in contrast to its
arguments to the court before the case was heard in January. In a
legal brief urging the justices to interpret Title IX narrowly, the
association said the statute does not apply to sexual harassment
between students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liability for damages under Title IX hinges on the existence
of gender discrimination by the grant recipient (school) _ not on
whether schools are successful in responding to allegations of
student misconduct,'' NSBA wrote in a legal brief to the justices.
</P>
<P>
   National Education Association President Bob Chase, whose group
represents 2.4 million teachers, called the court's decision a
``lesson ... that school districts should work to prevent sexual
harassment from occurring in the first place through education and
training programs for students and staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, Davis vs. Monroe County Board of Education, is similar
to one the justices decided last year in which they held that a
school near Austin, Texas, could not be held liable under Title IX
for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student. The court, in
Gebser vs. Lago Vista Independent School District, said schools can
be held liable for harassment only if they knew of the misbehavior
and showed ``deliberate indifference'' by failing to take action.
</P>
<P>
   Citing that decision, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in the
court's majority opinion Monday that schools can similarly be held
liable for ignoring the pleas of a student being so sexually
harassed that it interferes with her or his ability to receive an
education. To avoid liability, a school must take action to remedy
the harassment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the historical duty and freedom of schools to discipline
students, the court said administrators have leeway to decide how
to stop the harassment. The school's response, rather than having
to meet the common legal standard of being reasonable, must be just
``not clearly unreasonable,'' O'Connor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The court also went to great length to distinguish illegal
sexual harassment that prevents learning from mere sexual banter
that is a staple of teen-age discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is understandable that, in the school setting, students
often engage in insults, banter, teasing, shoving, pushing and
gender-specific conduct that is upsetting to the students subjected
to it,'' O'Connor wrote. ``Damages are not available for simple
acts of teasing and name-calling among schoolchildren, however,
even where these comments target differences in gender. Rather, in
the context of student-on-student harassment, damages are available
only where the behavior is so severe, pervasive and objectively
offensive that it denies its victims the equal access to education
that Title IX is designed to prevent.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining O'Connor's opinion were Justices John Paul Stevens,
David H.
</P>
<P>
   Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Anthony M. Kennedy registered his displeasure with
the court by taking the extraordinary step of reading parts of his
biting dissent from the bench. Kennedy, joined by three other
justices, assailed the court for what he called its improperly
broad interpretation of Title IX that will have federal judges _
rather than parents and teachers _ setting school disciplinary
policies regarding harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Litigation will increase as schools, parents and judges will
struggle to clarify the confusion the court has created by failing
to define clearly what constitutes illegal harassment under the
federal law, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the court seems ``oblivious'' to the widespread
teasing that goes on at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girl who wants to skip recess because she is teased by the
boys is no different from the overweight child who skips gym class
because the other children tease her about her size in the locker
room; or the child who risks flunking out because he refuses to
wear glasses to avoid the taunts of `four eyes'; or the child who
refuses to go to school because the school bully calls him a
`scaredy-cat' at recess,'' Kennedy wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most children respond to teasing in ways that detract from
their ability to learn. The majority's test for actionable
harassment will, as a result, sweep in almost all of the more
innocuous conduct (that is) a part of school life.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Kennedy's dissent were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.

 &HT;    Neagle goes on DL; weakness in rotator cuff the diagnosis
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ On that memorable day last Wednesday in Denver when
the Cincinnati Reds played ring-around-the-bases with 24 runs, 28
hits and six home runs, there was one frown in the postgame
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Denny Neagle was the only one who thought the food was
lousy and the beer was flat. Given a 6-0 lead in the first inning,
Neagle couldn't cruise. By the second inning, it was 6-6 and Neagle
was in the clubhouse showering nearly two hours before the game
ended, soaping up with a 0-3 record and a swollen 8.17 earned-run
average over six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Something is amiss and has been since Neagle reported to spring
training with a weak shoulder after the mid-winter trade with
Atlanta for All-Star second baseman Bret Boone.
</P>
<P>
   So, as expected, the Cincinnati Reds placed Neagle on the
disabled list Monday and are expected to fill his roster spot
before tonight's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers and pitcher
Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Jim Bowden was not assuaged by Los Angeles Dr.
Ralph Gambardella's diagnosis of weakness in Neagle's rotator cuff
after an examination Friday. Copies of an MRI have been sent to Dr.
Stanley Ho at Stanford University and Dr. James Meranus in
Cincinnati for evaluations and Neagle will be examined Wednesday by
noted sports physician James C. Andrews in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical information we have been provided is not
consistent with our baseball evaluation,'' Bowden said. ``There is
no point continuing on a path that has not allowed the strength in
Denny's shoulder to improve. If surgery is not recommended, we must
find a better way to strengthen his rotator cuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, fresh off a 6-1 trip to Denver and San Diego, are home
for three games against the Dodgers before bolting town again for
stops at Florida, New York and interleague games at Kansas City and
Minnesota _ a testy stretch of 18 road games and three home games.
</P>
<P>
   Infielder Carlos Baerga, leading the International League at
Triple-A Indianapolis with 52 hits entering the weekend, was the
top choice to join the club today, but a meeting Monday between
Bowden and manager Jack McKeon may have changed it.
</P>
<P>
   It could be infielder Aaron Boone or outfielder Mark Sweeney,
players who began the season with the Reds but were optioned to
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds want Boone to play every day, but Mark Lewis is manning
third base well and hitting .280. An extra outfielder isn't needed,
nor is a left-handed pinch-hitter, even though Sweeney had six
pinch-hits, including two pinch-hit home runs before he left.
</P>
<P>
   Baerga can play third base and second base and, as manager Jack
McKeon said, ``I'm not tub-thumping for Baerga, but he is a veteran
who knows how to play, is a switch-hitter and is a good guy in the
clubhouse.'' Baerga signed his first professional contract with the
San Diego Padres when McKeon was general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Baerga also would give McKeon a chance to rest shortstop Barry
Larkin, who has started all 40 games and missed only two innings.
Second baseman Pokey Reese, who signed as a shortstop, can move
back to short and Baerga can play second on days Larkin rests.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jeff Branson can play second, short and third and he
is hitting .280 at Indianapolis, but is another left-handed hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Also needed to be addressed is a fifth pitcher to go with Steve
Parris _ tonight's starter against Brown _ Brett Tomko, Pete
Harnisch and Steve Avery.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon indicated that Jason Bere was out of the rotation after
another shaky start last Tuesday in Colorado _ one-plus inning, two
runs, three hits, three walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, though, came back to win that game, 5-3. Amazingly,
although his earned-run average is 6.61 and he has given up 40
hits, 27 runs and 28 walks in his 31.1 innings, Bere is 2-0 and the
Reds are 6-2 in his eight starts, 5-0 over his last five.
</P>
<P>
   Bere was skipped once in the rotation last week and pitched a
simulated game Saturday in San Diego as pitching coach Don Gullett
tinkered with his mechanics. Indications are that Bere will start
Saturday in Florida when a fifth pitcher is needed, although
bullpenners Gabe White and Ron Villone have been mentioned.

WITH HASEK, THE QUESTION IS STARTING, NOT STOPPING
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Darcy Regier understood the unspoken implication of
the question. Regier, the general manager of the Buffalo Sabres,
was being asked about the injury to Dominik Hasek, his star goalie,
who missed Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals with a groin
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek missed practice Monday because he was back in Buffalo,
visiting doctors for extensive testing. And Hasek could miss Game 2
against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday night in Air Canada
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a happy surprise if he were in there,'' Regier
said.
</P>
<P>
   But some players play with pain and some do not, a reporter
said, adding, ``Do you have to swallow a little bit here and just
say, `This is what Dom wants and so this is the way we have to
approach it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Regier replied quickly and bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Regier said. ``If the question is, `Do we think he
should play with this injury?' Absolutely not. Not where he is
right now. He wanted to play very badly. When you see his eyes
welling up, you don't question what some people want to question. I
don't question it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hasek's absence on Sunday, the Sabres beat the Maple
Leafs by 5-4 as the backup Dwayne Roloson made 28 saves in the
opening game of the four-of-seven-game series. The winner will meet
Dallas or Colorado in the championship round.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres Coach Lindy Ruff said Hasek went to Buffalo for magnetic
resonance imaging and for a bone scan, after a doctor from Lansing,
Mich., was flown in to treat Hasek on Saturday night. Other
physicians were treating him in Buffalo Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek missed 12 games late in the regular season with this
injury and began to suffer from it again during the second round
against Boston. Two years ago, when a knee injury kept Hasek out of
some playoff games, some people doubted the severity of the
problem, and there were hard feelings toward him from both inside
and outside the team.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said that ``the injury has been there all along'' and
``it's just the pain factor right now.'' He said Hasek is taking
pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think one or two days is going to make a lot of
difference,'' Ruff said. ``It's painful, and we have to get that
pain eased. That is Dom's mentality. He's got to get it to a level
where he feels comfortable that he can perform his acrobatics. They
are going through every precaution with him. It's the pelvic area
and the bone there where the muscles are attached.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres also played Game 1 without Miroslav Satan, their
leading scorer in the regular season, who is out with a foot
bruise. Satan skated well Monday and could return sometime this
series.
</P>
<P>
   After practice Monday, the Leafs held a long team meeting and
said afterward that they would concentrate on their checking and
try not to allow the Sabres as many chances as they did in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Joseph, Toronto's star goalie, gave up five goals on
Buffalo's first 19 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said he was not pleased with all the Buffalo traffic in
front of his goal crease, creating distractions and blocking his
views of shots.
</P>
<P>
   But Buffalo's Ruff vowed, ``When we come out of the gates
tomorrow, we're coming with a full-court press again.'' Although
the Sabres were credited with a 52-35 edge in hitting, Ruff said
they could do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can hit more,'' Ruff said. ``We swung off a few
times. We've got to finish. It's something we've really stressed.
We've got some good hitters on the team. We'd like to take it one
level higher.''

 &HT;    IRL outlines safety procedures for Indy 500
 &HT;    By Dave Lance
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ In light of the spectator deaths at Lowes Motor
Speedway on May 1, Indy Racing League officials outlined details of
a safety system Monday that will be required on every car competing
in the Indianapolis 500 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   IRL executive director Leo Mehl hopes the new Suspension &AMP; Wheel
Energy Management System will reduce the chances of wheel
assemblies becoming detached during accidents. SWEMS takes
approximately two hours to install and Mehl said the 33 Indy cars
will be outfitted with the system by Carburetion Day on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The cars' chassis and suspension will be attached with multiple
restraints made of Zylon, which has a breaking strength of 5 tons.
</P>
<P>
   SWEMS is similar to tethers, which Formula One began using this
season. But Mehl said the two are slightly different, although they
both are designed to keep loosened suspension parts and wheels
connected during crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think tethers is the right term,'' he said from
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. ``This is a system that has several
Zylon cables, not just one rope as when you hear the word tether.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can imagine we've been working hard on this since (the
deaths). We've had a series of meetings with Dallara, G Force and
Riley &AMP; Scott (Indy car constructors).''
</P>
<P>
   Three spectators were killed at Lowes in Charlotte, N.C., when a
tire and other debris from a three-car pileup flew over a 15-foot
fence and into a grandstand. It was the second time in nine months
fans were killed as the result of an open-wheel car crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every (racing series) must react to this situation,''
Mehl said. ``I don't think any of us are sure what's going to
happen when you hit a wall at (over 200 mph), but we feel this is a
step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But how will it affect drivers during crashes? The major
complaint with tethered wheels and parts is that they might bounce
back and hit the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis Motor Speedway was closed Monday and drivers were
unavailable for comments. But team managers voiced their opinion on
SWEMS
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to make every effort to make open-wheel racing as
safe as it can be,'' said Thomas Knapp, Greg Ray's team manager.
``The initial impression is it probably has got a good design, but
unfortunately we can't design an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart's manager and car owner Larry Curry also thinks
SWEMS is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything they can do in the way of safety, I'm hugely
supportive of,'' Curry said. ``It's a problem we need to address
and not put off until tomorrow. I think it's absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a quality driver out there not concerned with the
possibility of a fan getting hurt. Anything that helps the fans,
Tony Stewart is going to be a big supporter of.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehl does not believe SWEMS will have a negative effect on
drivers during crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this is a good thing for the driver,'' he said. ``The
more we can keep attached to the car is better for the driver. The
less wheels and suspension around the track to run into is better
for the fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything possible to make sure the race is as
safe for the fans as it can be.

 &HT;    Alternative newspaper sold
 &HT;    By Jim Dillon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Impact Weekly , Dayton's major alternative
newspaper, has been sold pending shareholder approval.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Epton, co-publisher of Impact Weekly , said the paper's
board has approved its sale to a subsidiary of Yesse!
Communications Inc. of Indianapolis, a publisher of four
alternative weeklies in Indiana, Illinois and Iowa. The board will
ask shareholders June 1 to approve the sale, said Jeff Epton,
Impact Weekly's co-publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Yesse!, however, plans to
invest about $300,000 in Impact Weekly over the next 18 months so
it can hire more staff and boost its coverage, Epton said. The free
newspaper has a circulation of about 24,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal calls for all Impact Weekly staffers,
including Epton and co-publisher Marrianne McMullen, to be
retained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the masthead changes, but Jeff and Marrianne will
remain very much in charge'' of local operations, said Craig
Hitchcock, chairman and chief executive of Yesse! Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The paper will retain its ``edgy'' editorial format, but the
range and depth of editorial content will increase, Hitchcock and
Epton said.
</P>
<P>
   Impact Weekly, formerly known as the Dayton Voice , started
publication in August 1993. Epton said he has mixed feelings about
selling the newspaper, which remains unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels a little bit of regret. Certainly, if we had a
little more money or made some smarter decisions earlier, it might
be a different story,'' Epton said. ``But it's a positive thing for
us, and I hope it's a positive thing for those who read the
paper.''

STOCKS FALL FOR THIRD CONSECUTIVE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices staged a broad, steep selloff Monday,
led by big declines in Internet and technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third consecutive decline for stocks, and some
analysts said the market, which has charged ahead for much of the
year, might be in the midst of a correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said all along the market could correct anywhere from 5
percent to 10 percent at any time,'' said Ralph Acampora, chief
technical analyst at Prudential Securities. ``The market is about 5
percent off its high, but this is not over with. We could drop
another 4 to 5 percent from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and traders struggled to explain Monday's declines.
There was no economic news, and the bond market, which has been in
turmoil lately, was quiet. Trading activity was fairly light.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 754.7 million shares. On
the NASDAQ market, nearly 920 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ugly, and it's surprising to me,'' said Bill Allyn, head
of listed trading at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``It's been a
take-no-prisoners kind of day. I think this is aberrational
activity and that the market will be back.''
</P>
<P>
   By the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 174.61 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,654.67.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market averages were hit even harder.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 23.64, or 1.8
percent, to 1,306.65. The NASDAQ composite index suffered its
biggest loss in five weeks, falling 66.48, or 2.6 percent, to
2,453.66. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks dropped
8.75 points, or 2 percent, to 440.39. And TheStreet.com's Internet
stock index tumbled 46.70, or 7.5 percent, to 576.68.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mayo, a bank stock analyst at Credit Suisse First
Boston, contributed to the negative tone.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened, Mayo cut his ratings on several big
money-center banks to ``sell'' from ``hold'' on concern their
profits might suffer in part from problems related to Year 2000
computer problems. His comments ignited a selloff that spread
throughout the financial services sector of the market. By the
close of trading, the Standard &AMP; Poor's financial stock index had
fallen 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And Acampora may have added fuel to the fire when he suggested
that five big Internet stocks, including America Online, Excite and
Yahoo, were vulnerable if the stocks fell through certain price
support levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk about the banks put some pressure on some of the
sacred cows that have helped move the market up,'' said Al Goldman,
chief market analyst at A.G. Edwards Inc. ``It also conjured up
some latent fear that had been in the woodwork about Y2K. But the
economy didn't go from good to bad over the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Hewlett-Packard were the biggest losers among the Dow
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   IBM fell 6|, to 223}. And Hewlett-Packard lost 3~, to 90.
</P>
<P>
   Among financial stocks, Citigroup fell 2 11/16, to 65[. Chase
Manhattan lost 3 1/16, to 75~. American Express slumped 3 7/16, to
116 13/16. And Merrill Lynch dropped 4 3/16, to 70 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   America Online was among the biggest losers of the stocks that
make up the S&AMP;P 500. The stock fell 6 15/16, to 119{.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yahoo plummeted 13 7/16, to 137~. Excite fell 14~, to
118 1/16. Cisco Systems, another component of the S&AMP;P 500 and the
leading maker of Internet equipment, fell 3~, to 109]. And
Priceline.com fell 13 19/32, to 125 11/32.
</P>
<P>
   Airline and drug stocks also fell.
</P>
<P>
   UAL, the parent of United Airlines, fell 2\, to 72[. AMR, parent
of American Airlines, declined 2 3/16, to 64 3/16. And Delta
Airlines dropped 2{, to 58.
</P>
<P>
   Among big drug stocks, Warner-Lambert fell 3, to 63~.
Bristol-Myers Squibb shed 2}, to 65 3/16. And Pfizer dropped 4, to
106\.
</P>
<P>
   Utility stocks, often used as a haven when conditions are
unsettled in other sectors, were one of the market's few bright
spots Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Utilities average gained 2.28 points, to 327.43,
its fourth straight record.
</P>
<P>
   Peco Energy rose 1{, to 50; Consolidated Natural Gas rose 11/16,
to 58{, and Duke Energy climbed 1\, to 59].
</P>
<P>
   In other developments, Avis Rent a Car, the nation's
second-largest car rental company behind Hertz, fell 7], to 28,
after it agreed to buy Cendant's fleet operations. Cendant rose
11/16, to 19~. &QL;

 &HT;    Plans for Everglades, Florida waterways endangered
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When dirty water pounded the St. Lucie
River last year and the Lake Okeechobee dike sprang leaks, water
managers said part of their difficulty stemmed from a flood-prone
community about 100 miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Their solution: Buy and remove the community, unclogging a
drainage bottleneck that has plagued the lake, the river and the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   But now those plans are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies that offered to put up part of the money haven't.
Opponents are attacking in court. Some congressmen are openly
hostile.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the South Florida Water Management District may
have to decide as early as next month whether to proceed with
buying the community known as the 8 1/2-Square-Mile Area, just east
of Everglades National Park. They also could seek a compromise that
would leave most of the area's 400 homes intact while restoring
natural flows into the park's northeast corner.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the district's board is investigating
accusations that its staff illegally discussed the buyout in secret
or bullied residents into selling.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the momentum is on their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walls are starting to come tumbling down,'' said Joette
Lorion, a consultant for the Miccosukee Indian tribe, which accuses
the buyout's supporters of an irrational obsession with eradicating
the community. ``They're going to risk the entire Everglades
restoration for this.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters say this isn't the time to flinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation needs some leadership,'' said Charles Lee,
senior vice president of the Florida Audubon Society. He said the
district should buy the homes even if it has to go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   The district's board voted in November to begin the buyout, long
advocated by the park's staff and almost all environmental groups _
as long as the U.S. Interior Department and Miami-Dade County pay
part of the $55 million to $124 million costs. They estimated they
would be finished in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, district Land Director Bill Malone says more than a
quarter of the community's roughly 1,200 landowners have expressed
an interest in selling. But only the board can decide, perhaps as
early as June, whether to close on any of the sales.
</P>
<P>
   Little else seems to have worked out as planned:
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department says it can't provide any money until it
finishes an environmental study that won't be done until early
2000. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt didn't mention that snag
Nov. 12, when he offered to pay half the costs and said some of the
money could be available this year.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Miami-Dade County has put off its decision
indefinitely. Meanwhile, nearly a third of the county commissioners
have recused themselves because they own land in the community or
have other conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   A federal-state advisory group last week removed the area from a
list of land purchases that the Interior Department should pursue.
Buyout supporters say the action was only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Hostile congressmen heaped scorn on the buyout last month at a
hearing packed with homeowners and tribe representatives. ABC News
later cited the controversy as evidence that ``no one is really in
charge'' of the Everglades restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout also is facing scrutiny from a new set of water
managers, whom Gov. Jeb Bush appointed in March with marching
orders to respect property rights.
</P>
<P>
   The new board has hired Boca Raton lawyer Robert Rivas, an
expert on the state's Government-in-the-Sunshine law, to
investigate whether the staff broke the law. District employees
have denied that accusation, contained in a lawsuit from the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's top Everglades adviser, Allison DeFoor, said he's
awaiting the results of that investigation, too.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers also have ordered their inspector general to
investigate accusations that employees intimidated residents or
falsely told them that the district has the power to condemn their
land. Malone denies it.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than buy the community, the tribe advocates building
pumps and levees to protect it from flooding, as Congress
authorized in 1989. But park scientists say leaving the community
intact would inevitably lead to more dense development and an
outcry for more aggressive flood control, draining the park dry.
</P>
<P>
   The 8 1/2-Square-Mile Area story began decades ago, when
landowners began erecting homes _ many apparently without permits _
in a largely agricultural enclave just west of the dike that
separates the Everglades from the populated coast.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers say they can't restore natural flows into the
park without worsening flooding in the neighborhood. They said the
blocked flow contributed to a disastrous water glut in early 1998,
when the corps said it had no choice but to empty a full Lake
Okeechobee into the St. Lucie River. Even so, the dike surrounding
the lake sprang leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe blames the delay on government's indecision.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has taken on a Cold War tone, with some Cuban exiles
in the community comparing the water managers to Fidel Castro.
Miccosukee attorney Dexter Lehtinen even accused the
environmentalists of being ``socialists.'' ``They are a dangerous
group,'' he said. ``They are upset that people can own private
property in America.'' Lee countered that letting the residents
stay would mean squandering public money on pumps, levees and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have is a very small number of people who are in an
untenable situation, and they're asking the rest of society to
subsidize their existence,'' Lee said.

AN ARGENTINE `DOMINO EFFECT' ON BRAZILIAN STOCKS 
(PREVIOUSLY SKEDED AS: BRAZIL-DEBT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)   (jw) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ When news of pressure on the Argentine peso
started to scroll down the computer screens on trading floors here
last week, traders mainly chuckled, stoking the historic rivalry
between Brazil and its neighbor to the south.
</P>
<P>
   They're not chuckling anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Bovespa stock index for the Sao Paulo stock exchange plunged
nearly 4.89 percent Monday, its largest one-day percentage drop
since the country's currency devaluation crisis in mid-January, as
concern over Argentina's economic policies pushed the index to its
lowest level in nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
   The decline was deeper than similar drops in stock markets in
other Latin American countries, Argentina included. Worries over
the return of a small tax on foreign investment in Brazilian
securities and of higher interest rates in the Unites States
contributed to the decline.
</P>
<P>
   The pullback in the market, mainly because of factors abroad
beyond the control of Brazilian policy-makers, is denting a newly
found optimism among investors, though it is not a surprise. In a
conundrum that has often applied to Brazil in recent years, the
country has often been among the first to pay for bad news coming
from other emerging markets, or the United States, the largest
source of Brazil's foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon is due mainly to the size of Brazil, Latin
America's largest country, and the relative sophistication of its
financial system. Because there are so many Brazilian stocks and
bonds in comparison with other developing countries, and because
these securities are the most liquid, they are often the first to
be sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The domino effect is back,'' said Marcelo Cestari, the chief
equities trader at Banco Mercantil do Brasil. ``Everything seems
negative again and there doesn't seem much we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the decline in markets here came on a day when the
economy received a vote of confidence. Brazil abandoned a plan to
swap billions of dollars of corporate debt for less risky
securities supported by the government, because investors shunned
the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Although the scrapping of the deal is not positive for Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., the investment bank that designed it, it is positive
as a measurement of restored faith in Brazil among foreign
investors. The main reason for the swap not going forward is a
general perception among investors that the chances are minimal for
a wave of corporate bond defaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a moment when panic reigned and people would have
taken anything for Brazilian bonds,'' said Jonathan Binder, the
senior investment strategist at Americas Trust Bank, a Miami-based
institution with a varied portfolio of Brazilian debt. If the
transaction engineered by Goldman, Sachs had been introduced a few
months ago, in the aftermath of the currency devaluation in
mid-January, Binder said, it may have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Investors agreed to exchange only about $680 million of an
eligible $19.6 billion of foreign debt issued by Brazilian
companies for securities sold by an offshore company linked to the
country's development bank. That was shy of the $1 billion bankers
deemed necessary for the transaction to proceed. At the end of last
week, officials from the development bank, known by its initials
BNDES, said they were confident of swapping at least $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the government's aim with the deal, which was to
facilitate Brazilian borrowing, is slowly materializing. A few
top-tier banks such as Banco Bradesco and Banco Itau have succeeded
in refinancing their own borrowings in international markets. These
institutions, in turn, have begun lending again to large corporate
clients.
</P>
<P>
   With overnight interest rates still high, though, at 23.5
percent, such financing doesn't come cheap. Even Brazil's largest
companies pay an estimated 27 percent domestically on a one-year
loan, compared with a rate of roughly half that amount if the
financing is secured in more liquid international borrowing
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with investors betting that most Brazilian companies will
find a way to honor their obligations, the bond swap, although
scrapped on paper, may have succeeded psychologically. ``The deal
calmed markets by showing that government support was there,'' said
Binder of Americas Trust Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Such support is not a novelty. For several companies facing debt
difficulties earlier this year, such as the railroad MRS Logistica,
the government stepped in and engineered subtle bailouts through
the use of pension funds for state-controlled companies and
state-controlled banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There somehow seems to be this intervention and problems are
resolved,'' said Anne Milne, the head of emerging markets debt
research at ING Barings in New York. She compared this strategy to
that of neighboring Argentina, where the government has done little
to help.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, there have been six Argentine debt defaults,
compared with two in Brazil.

ST IN HAWAIIAN WATERS  
 STOPPING CHARTRES  
 A CHOICE OF HORSE SHOWS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>

   In Hawaiian Waters &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Could you tell me what inter-island surface
transportation is available in the Hawaiian Islands other than
cruise ships? (Air transport misses the feel of the area.) _ J.
Douglas Miller, Katonah, N.Y.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Traveling between islands by boat is the exception in Hawaii.
The only such passenger service operating daily, according to the
Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau, links Maui, the second
largest of the six major populated islands, and Lanai, the
smallest.
</P>
<P>
   A journey of 45 minutes to an hour takes passengers from Maui,
which is bustling with beachfront hotels and resorts, to Lanai,
home to about 3,000 residents and the former site of sizable
pineapple fields.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle _ actually a powerboat that carries up to 80
passengers _ is run by Expeditions, Post Office Box 10, Lahaina,
Hawaii 96767, (808) 661-3756, fax (808) 661-0544. It operates
between Lahaina harbor, across from the Pioneer Inn, and Manele
harbor on Lanai. The fare is $25 one way and $50 round trip; for
children 2 to 11, it's $20 one way, $40 round trip. Add 4.166
percent state tax to all fares. Reservations required.
</P>
<P>
   Boats depart five times daily in each direction. The first and
last leave Maui at 6:45 a.m. and 5:45 p.m., respectively, and Lanai
at 8 a.m. and 6:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   An Expeditions package covers an overnight stay on Lanai at the
Manele Bay resort or the Lodge at Koele as well as the ferry and
transportation between the dock and the hotel. The total cost for
two is $339 plus 11.42 percent in state and hotel taxes. Or you can
stay at the Hotel Lanai, (808) 565-7211, for $95 to $200 a night
plus tax; that's for the hotel alone.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a tent, there's a campground, with showers and
bathrooms, about 100 yards from Hulopoe Beach, (808) 565-3982;
that'll be $5 per person per night plus a onetime $5 registration
fee.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday and Saturday, an excursion leaves Lahaina for
Kaunakakai, the main city on Molokai. It is run by Lin Wa Cruises,
113 Prison Street, Lahaina, Hawaii 96761, (800) 275-6969 or (808)
565-8218, and takes an hour and a half. Passengers set out at 6:15
a.m. and head back from Molokai at 2 p.m. The trip, aboard a yacht
that carries 149 passengers, is $69, $35 for children, plus a 4
percent tax and a 2 percent harbor fee. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stopping in Chartres &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)We are going to France in the fall and would like to
pick up a car at Charles de Gaulle Airport and drop it off at the
train station at Chartres. Is there somewhere we can leave our
luggage while we tour the city? _ Carol A. Greene, Loudon,
Tenn.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Unfortunately, there are no lockers or baggage rooms in the
Chartres train station. Because of the fear of terrorist bombs,
most lockers and baggage rooms in France have been closed for about
five years. In an emergency, the chef de quai, who is in charge of
the station, can accept suitcases for a short while in his office,
but he is not obliged to do so.
</P>
<P>
   If you rent from Avis, you can drop your car off at the station
and leave the keys in a designated box since Avis and the French
railway system have an agreement making such dropoffs possible at
most French rail stations.
</P>
<P>
   Another solution may be to leave your suitcases in a rented car
(not exposed, of course), visit the cathedral and then return the
car just before taking the train to Paris. Or you can simply make
Chartres a day trip from Paris, unencumbered by a car or concern
about luggage.
</P>
<P>
   You may have the good fortune to be in Chartres between Easter
and November. That is when Malcolm Miller, a guide who since 1958
has been helping visitors grasp the meaning of medieval
iconography, is there. To Miller, the cathedral is ``a remarkable
library of human knowledge.'' ``In a world where few could read or
write,'' he once noted, ``the pictures in the glass and the
statuary provided almost everything the medieval man or woman
wanted to know about the world here and the life hereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's tours, which run an hour and a quarter, are conducted
daily except Sunday at noon and at 2:45 p.m. Participants meet near
the gift shop in the cathedral. Tours are $6.50, $3.25 for
students, at 6.2 francs to the dollar. Information: (33-2)
37.28.15.58, fax (33-2) 37.28.33.03.
</P>
<P>
   The first train for Chartres departs Montparnasse station in
Paris at 6:24 a.m., the last return leaves Chartres at 9:06 p.m.
The trip takes 45 to 90 minutes; round trip fare is $23 second
class, $34.80 first class. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Choice of Horse Shows &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I would like to take my granddaughter to a national
horse show to celebrate her 13th birthday. Can you suggest some? _
Naomi Singer, Pepper Pike, Ohio(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Here are some shows in Ohio and Michigan during the summer,
with a sprinkling of highlights. Major events usually take place on
Friday and Saturday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Motor City Horse Show, from June 16 to 20, and the Detroit
Horse Show, from June 22 to 27, are both held at the Bloomfield
Open Hunt Club, 405 East Long Lake, Bloomfield Hills, Mich. 48304;
(248) 644-9411, fax (248) 644-3958. Only general admission seats
are left for both shows, and they are $5. Highlights: children and
adult amateur owners take part in both hunter and jumper events on
Fridays. In the grand prix events, held on Saturday evenings, horse
and rider compete against the clock on a course with 10 to 12 jumps
over obstacles at least 4 feet 6 inches high and 5 to 6 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan All Morgan Horse Show, July 7 to 10, Michigan State
Fairgrounds, Woodward and Eight Mile, in Detroit. The restored
1940s fairgrounds, just off I-75, are on the city limits. No
admission fee, parking $4. Information: (810) 793-4583 or (248)
437-5757. Morgan horses are known for their versatility as these
highlights suggest: carriage driving with a single rider; hunters
judged on walk, trot and canter; pro-am class events, in which
professional and amateur riders ride hunters, Western and English
pleasure horses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State Fair Horse Show, July 23 to Aug. 22, at the Ohio Expo
Center, on 17th Avenue near I-71, in Columbus. When the fair opens
on Aug. 6, admission will be charged: $7 for ages 13 to 59, and $6
for ages 5 to 12 and 60 and above; parking is $4. Information:

WHEN A TORMENTED CHILD CRIED STOP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   (jw) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ LaShonda Davis was 10 when she told her mother it was
time to hire a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Aurelia Davis, was bewildered at first. For months,
LaShonda had been harassed by a boy in her fifth-grade class in
Forsyth, Ga., about 50 miles southwest of Atlanta. The school,
Hubbard Elementary, had not done anything to stop the boy, even
though he had grown increasingly provocative, rubbing against
LaShonda and asking for sex.
</P>
<P>
   But hiring a lawyer seemed drastic to Ms. Davis. Even Monday,
after the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a significant ruling
supporting the Davis family's contention that schools can be held
liable for prolonged harassment, Ms. Davis was still appalled that
the matter had required such high-level legal attention, and the
support of women's rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should never have had to go all the way to the Supreme
Court,'' said Ms. Davis, a hospital file clerk in this small town
who had never hired a lawyer before. ``They should have done
something right from the start. But they didn't have any kind of
respect for my child, and they didn't want to admit that they were
wrong in what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The harassment, which started in December 1992, went on almost
every day for five months, Ms. Davis said. She said she complained
to the teacher and the principal, but nothing was done until she
called the sheriff and had the boy prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually pleaded guilty to sexual battery.
</P>
<P>
   During those five months, Ms. Davis said, LaShonda grew
increasingly upset and despondent, talking of suicide and having a
difficult time in class. She is now 16 and a junior in high school.
</P>
<P>
   School officials in Monroe County, which includes Hubbard, would
not comment, but the school board's lawyers have argued that
federal law never explicitly held schools responsible for
preventing the harassment of one student by another.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed Monday with the court's 5-4 decision, which
applies to any school in the nation that accepts federal money. The
court's reasoning was based on an interpretation of Title IX, the
1972 law barring sexual discrimination at such schools, and
occasioned an impassioned debate among justices over the degree to
which the federal government should be involved in what Justice
Anthony Kennedy in his dissenting opinion called ``the routine
problems of adolescence.''
</P>
<P>
   All that is beside the point for Ms. Davis, who says she is also
unconcerned about the monetary damages for which she is now
eligible to sue. For her, it comes down to a much more basic
principle:
</P>
<P>
   ``They make you send your kids to school, right? So don't you
think they should protect them while they're there?''

USC'S DAVIS LEAVES HIS MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jerome Davis of USC closes out his collegiate
career in next week's NCAA track and field championships, but it
will be difficult for the defending national 400-meter champion to
top his performance in the Pacific-10 Conference finals at Arizona
State on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Davis won an unprecedented fourth Pac-10 title in a
lifetime-best 44.95 seconds _ the fastest time in the nation this
season _ and turned in a stunning 43.8 anchor to lift the Trojans'
1,600 relay of LeRoy Jordan, DeJon Joyner and Felix Sanchez to a
come-from-behind victory over UCLA in a collegiate-leading and
Pac-10 meet-record 3:02.68.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also won the 200 in 20.58 and combined with Charles Lee,
formerly of Cleveland High and Valley College; Miguel Fletcher, a
freshman from Alemany; and Sultan McCullough on USC's victorious
400 relay that timed 39.46.
</P>
<P>
   The four Pac-10 titles brought Davis' career total to 10. In
addition, Davis became only the sixth athlete in conference history
to win the same event four years in a row, an elite list that
includes Trojans long jumper Randy Williams, the 1972 Olympic
champion; USC hammer thrower Balazs Kiss (1993-96), the 1996
Olympic champion; and the late Steve Prefontaine, who won the
3-mile from 1970-73 at Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling to put a mark in history, but it is hard
to believe that I have done it,'' said Davis, who called his first
and last 400 titles the most challenging. ``I didn't try to focus
on it, I just tried to put in perspective as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   USC, buoyed by Davis, won its second Pac-10 title in three years
with 164 points to avenge a one-point loss to UCLA in the annual
cross-town dual meet May 1. UCLA was second with 136 points and
Stanford was third with 105.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA women _ boosted by junior Seilala Sua, winner of the
hammer, shot put and javelin, and sophomore Michelle Perry from
Quartz Hill, who won the 100-meter hurdles in 13.37 _ captured
their third consecutive title with 160 points.
</P>
<P>
   USC finished second with 140 points.

   While the decision thrust Lawrence A. Bell III, the City Council
president and Mfume's second cousin, into the role of front-runner,
it disappointed an array of city and state leaders who had urged
Mfume to jump into the Democratic primary to succeed Mayor Kurt L.
Schmoke, a three-term Democrat who decided not to seek another four
years in office.
</P>
<P>
   State leaders favored Mfume for mayor so much that they changed
Maryland law to require that a Baltimore mayoral candidate live in
the city only six months before the election, rather than a year,
because Mfume only recently changed his residency to the city from
Baltimore County. In addition, a group of 200 prominent
Baltimoreans, including three former mayors, formed a draft
movement last month to rally support for him.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Mfume said, he could not turn his back on the
NAACP, the nation's oldest civil-rights organization, just three
years after he left a safe seat in Congress to lead it, signing a
five-year contract that pays more than twice the mayor's annual
salary, $95,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``A plethora of inequities cry out for advocates of social
justice to get involved and stay involved,'' he said at at the
NCAAP national headquarters here. ``I cannot walk away from that
fight at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   His deliberations effectively chilled the mayoral race for
months. Besides Bell and Carl Stokes, a former city council member,
several other Democrats are running. But none have been able to
ignite much excitement, let alone raise the money needed to sustain
a campaign through the September primary and November general
election.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, an overwhelmingly Democratic city, the winner of
the party primary is virtually assured of victory two months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not been an enviable position,'' Mfume said of
ambivalent feelings that did not dissipate, he said, until Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume said he reached his decision after getting in touch with
his ``inner voice, a voice I always listened to and that always
guided me correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, he said, the voice told him to finish what he had
started, seeming to answer what he described months ago as his
fundamental consideration: ``Where could I do the most for the
greatest number of people?'' He offered no additional reasons
Monday for his decision.
</P>
<P>
   With Mfume out of the mayoral race, Bell is expected to rev up
what has been a rather quiet campaign. Yet he will do so without
the support of many Baltimore luminaries, including William Donald
Schaefer, a four-term mayor, a two-term governor of Maryland and
one of those leading the effort to encourage Mfume to run.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Mfume indicate whether he would support his cousin. He
said he routinely did not endorse candidates until the filing
deadline passes, July 6, in this case.

 EDITORIAL: STUDENTS AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, May 25:
</P>
<P>
   A bitterly divided Supreme Court on Monday affirmed the legal
obligation of schools to protect students from severe and pervasive
sexual harassment by other students. The 5-4 decision marked an
important turning point for education and for civil rights. Most
significantly, it recognized that student-on-student sexual
harassment not only disrupts a victim's ability to learn but, in
egregious cases, may also amount to a violation of Title IX of the
Education Amendments of 1972, the law that bars sex discrimination
in schools and colleges receiving federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved a fifth-grade girl in Georgia who was
subjected to months of taunting and unwanted touching by a male
classmate who was eventually convicted in juvenile court of sexual
battery. Despite repeated complaints, school officials refused to
take action. Overturning a ruling last year by the federal appeals
court in Atlanta, the court declared that Title IX covers
student-on-student harassment. It then held that school districts
can be held liable for the student's misconduct, applying
essentially the same stringent standard the court adopted last year
for cases of student harassment by teachers. ``Recipients of
federal funding,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the
majority, may be liable ``where the recipient is deliberately
indifferent to known acts of student-on-student sexual
harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also said that the behavior at issue must be severe
and pervasive _ a clear and appropriate effort to draw a line
between illegal harassment and everyday playground behavior. By
contrast, the dissenters _ Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia _
seemed to view such harassment as a normal rite of adolescence.
They further criticized the majority for meddling in school
disciplinary decisions. Ms. O'Connor's unusually sharp rejoinder
from the bench got it just right. Far from teaching ``little Johnny
a perverse lesson in federalism,'' as the dissenters alleged, the
majority was simply trying to ensure ``that little Mary may attend
class.''

ESPN AND BASEBALL LAWSUITS ARE A LEGAL FOOD FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits are being lobbed so rapidly between Major League
Baseball and ESPN that Bat Track technology may be required in
federal court to determine who slugs harder, Bud Selig, the
baseball commissioner, or George Bodenheimer, the ESPN president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Selig triggers his hitch in time, he gets his bat up to 93
miles per hour,'' Joe Morgan might say. ``Bodenheimer has a quick
swing, hits to the opposite field and if he's not fooled by a
slider, he can swing like Bud.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no room for compromise, as the battle rages
over the propriety of ESPN's shifting three Sunday night baseball
games in September to ESPN2 to make room for early-season National
Football League telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL contract costs ESPN $600 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN says the contract permits the shift, but baseball calls it
a breach that will let it terminate the deal after this season and
seek a new cable partner.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN sued baseball on May 4, saying baseball had unfairly put an
end to the deal. In a countersuit filed last Friday, baseball
charged, ``In entering into the NFL agreement, ESPN deliberately
breached its contract with baseball in order to pursue increased
revenue for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball produced language from the contract (but not the
contract) that it says obligates ESPN to keep the September games
on ESPN, which has 76.6 million subscribers, and boot the NFL games
to ESPN2, which has 64.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   This is a case about bruised feelings. ESPN did not inform
baseball of its plans 17 months ago to buy rights to the first half
of the NFL season, so that it could carry games that were formerly
TNT's. Baseball has been incensed ever since.
</P>
<P>
   This case may turn on contractual language that, baseball
insists, mandates that ESPN not sign any deals that conflict with
its ability to show every Sunday night game on ESPN (but not
ESPN2). More likely, this legal food fight between former friends
may become an exercise in semantics, which probably won't be as
interesting as ESPN's carrying the National Spelling Bee.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN argues that Sunday games can be pre-empted for ``events of
significant viewer interest.'' ESPN determines this through
ratings: its NFL games last season averaged an 8.1 Nielsen cable
rating; its baseball games averaged a 1.8.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's view is different. First, it notes that the contract
says ``an event of significant viewer interest,'' not ``events.''
Does that make a difference? You bet. The singular, to baseball,
connotes something really big, something really special, like the
Olympics, which ESPN doesn't have.
</P>
<P>
   (To baseball, the Sept. 12 Milwaukee-Colorado game will always
mean more than the competing Steelers-Browns matchup, essentially
because its contract came first. This may be the wrong year to
argue significance.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense is silly semantics,'' said Dick Glover, an
executive vice president of ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   To baseball, NFL games fail miserably to meet the significance
test, no matter their ratings. To baseball, substituting another
sport's ``regularly scheduled programming'' misuses the
significance threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, baseball has approved switches of regularly scheduled
events on Wednesday nights. Wednesday night, baseball will go to
ESPN2 in favor of Game 3 of hockey's Dallas-Colorado Western
Conference final series; next Wednesday, Game 6 of the
Toronto-Buffalo hockey series will pre-empt baseball on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts work against their argument,'' Glover said. ``They
feel the criteria for Wednesdays and Sundays are different, but
they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover said documents exist to prove that baseball officials
have been aware that ESPN wanted to acquire the NFL rights it did
not have and would, if necessary, move the Sunday night baseball
games in September to ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has rejected ESPN's remedies, and ESPN has spurned what
it contends was a demand by baseball for $350 million to accept the
Sunday night shifts (which baseball denies demanding).
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, baseball says ESPN is carrying too many
baseball clips on ``Sportscenter.'' While baseball is arguing to
get off ESPN, Glover said, sounding amazed, ``They're also
complaining about too much coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Short of a settlement or a drawn-out trial, this
could end up with baseball selling its Sunday night rights to TNT,
which has 76 million viewers, and its Wednesday night rights to
ESPN. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ With his brief career as a central-city grocer
coming to a close, Tremayne Franks displayed the uncommon charms
that have won him local renown.
</P>
<P>
   He cursed. He pouted. He sucked a grape lollipop. He proposed to
women three times his age. He followed his boss around the store
mocking his accented English: ``MAH-ka-shay! MAH-ka-shay!'' he
taunted, in make-believe Arabic. When a customer asked for a box of
hair gel, he tried to sell her a condom.
</P>
<P>
   And with each violation of workplace decorum, he offered a
disarming defense: one of the most winning smiles the city has seen
on either side of a candy counter.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years old but going on 21, the neighborhood's youngest
corner grocer is too short to reach the cash register without
standing on a milk crate and too streetwise to pass as a child. In
a life without refuge, he has been searching for a shelter, and he
found one fleetingly at the Fast Deal Super Market, among the pork
rinds and hot pickles. Until the store unexpectedly closed the
other day, he wore an impressive if self-awarded title: the
``Always Only Assistant Boss.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother is one of 30,000 women shorn from the city's welfare
rolls. He says she went south to work as a stripper and has not
been heard from since. His father just returned to jail. His
grandmother, a hospital housekeeper, works all night and sleeps
most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Only Mohammad Shaqroum, the store's sociable owner, seemed able
to abide the boy's mischievous intensity. They came to a kind of
understanding: The ``AOAB'' could keep up his foul, flamboyant
banter as long as he worked the mop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make it rough on him,'' Shaqroum said, trying not
to sound dejected after three burglaries, a flood and a lease
dispute forced a going-out-of-business sale. His own life savings
were flying out the door along with the remaining cans of
Beefaroni, but he hoped to leave behind a lesson. ``I want to make
him hate the store and love the school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of poor inner-city boys search for male role models. But
not many find them among the city's Palestinian shopkeepers.
Relations between the foreign-born grocers and their poor black
customers are famously tense. At least a dozen of the central-city
merchants have been murdered over the last decade, including
several of Shaqroum's friends.
</P>
<P>
   In the close-knit circle of Arab-American grocers, Shaqroum, 24,
was known for his fearlessness: He worked long hours, always
unarmed, on one of the city's most dangerous blocks. To his
customers, he was known for his friendliness: He learned all their
names, and those of their babies, and gave favored families credit
when their food stamps ran out.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of an urban sociologist, the last days of the Fast
Deal could be weighted with fancy freight. The story could be
called a window onto strained race relations or a portrait of
fatherless boys. It could serve as a study of one troubled family
dropped from the welfare rolls. It could be heard as a sad echo of
the vast black migration out of the segregated South, or a sad echo
of the Palestinian migration out of the troubled West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some people would say the story indicts Milwaukee's unparalleled
welfare reductions: Tremayne's mother abandoned him not long after
losing her aid.
</P>
<P>
   Others would say it is welfare itself that the story indicts:
Years of welfare checks did not solve the family's problems, and
the boy's grandmother thinks they made things worse.
</P>
<P>
   As Fast Deal's closing neared, the AOAB mopped on, unburdened by
such questions. To him the moral was something simpler: the
surprising happiness in nasty chores and a wage that ranged from
nothing at all up to a yo-yo a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dude, it ain't the money,'' he said in exasperation. ``I just
like to have someplace to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I started coming here because I had a lot of stress on my
mind,'' he said. ``This is a nice, calm place.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many stories in Milwaukee's central city, this one began
two generations ago and about 750 miles south. In 1962, Glendora
Johnson, the young grocer's grandmother, left Mississippi for
Chicago and then Milwaukee. She reared five children. One did well
as a social worker. Two others, including Tremayne's father, are in
jail for drug-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Tremayne's intelligence was both obvious and
neglected. His parents, Terry Johnson and Carolyn Franks, fought,
separated and fought some more. Doctors gave him heavy doses of
Ritalin to calm him, and he spent years in an enervated state. Off
the medication now, he is known as one of the brightest
fourth-graders in his school and one of the most frequently
suspended. He is not mean, his teachers say, just manic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk a lot,'' he said. ``When the teacher says stop, I
don't. That's one of my problems.''
</P>
<P>
   About the time he was 6, his grandmother says, another drug hit
the family: cocaine. In 1995, court documents show, Tremayne's
father drew a nine-month sentence, and was ordered into
substance-abuse counseling, after he broke into Ms. Franks' home,
sliced her sofa with a butcher knife and beat her in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Franks had other problems. Hearing her called a ``shake
dancer'' and a ``stripper,'' Tremayne asked one day what that
meant. ``She said, `I dance in front of the men, and they give me
money,''' he said. But sometimes the men robbed her. Once, he
recalls, she went to ``go dance for these dudes,'' and ``they beat
her up real bad.'' His worst memory of his mother's problems is
that she sent him to school dirty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other kids would say, `Oh, the dude comes to school bummy,' ''
he said. ``And I'd have to beat them up.''
</P>
<P>
   When the welfare system gave her a work assignment in 1996, Ms.
Franks refused to comply. She lost her $517 monthly check, was
evicted and moved in with a sister. She left town early last year.
Tremayne says she went to Mississippi to dance, or maybe to
Louisiana. She never sent a forwarding address.
</P>
<P>
   Though he often talks of missing his mother, he sides with the
officials who took away her aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't go to the interviews, so they cut her off,'' he
said. ``I don't blame them. You got to work for your money.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After 19 years on the night shift, his grandmother takes an even
dimmer view of welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just made a bunch of sorry people, welfare did,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Things began looking up last summer when his father got out of
jail, where he had been serving 17 months for selling cocaine.
After an unhappy stay with his grandmother, who says she is so
tired she no longer wants to care for him, Tremayne was elated to
have a parent again, even one on parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'll never leave you,''' Tremayne recalled. ```I'm
going to stay with you the rest of my life.'''
</P>
<P>
   His father found a job and impressed Tremayne's teachers with
earnest concern about the boy's suspensions. He took his son out
for frequent dinners and movies. But he also smoked marijuana in
the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him every day, `Dad, would you please stop smoking
weed?''' Tremayne said. ```You're going to go to jail.'''
</P>
<P>
   And he did, last month, after failing a urine test.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of his parents' problems, Tremayne thinks he may have a
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be a lawyer,'' he said. ``I'm going to make a lot
of money when I grow up so I can take care of my dad and, if she
comes back, my mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Franks family was being dropped from the welfare rolls in
1996, Shaqroum's journey to the United States was getting under
way. Reared in Ramallah on the West Bank, he married a neighbor
with American citizenship and followed her family to Louisiana.
They split up within a month, and Shaqroum joined a sister in
Milwaukee. He climbed the corner-grocery ladder, saved $12,000 and
opened the Fast Deal last August.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a propitious time. When the cash welfare rolls fall
80 percent, as they have in Milwaukee, welfare grocers feel the
bite. Food stamp caseloads have also fallen, by about 35 percent.
In the old days, a store like the Fast Deal would gross about
$2,000 a day, Shaqroum said. But he took in only about $800.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a safe time, either. In January, a storekeeper a few
blocks away was bludgeoned to death by three young men with a
champagne bottle. They made off with about $20. Fearful of his own
temper, Shaqroum will not carry a gun. Instead, he doodles Arabic
poems on brown paper bags.
</P>
<P>
   One recent work struck a note of faith: ``Sometimes business is
slow _ it's in God's hands.'' Another had more of a martial flair.
According to Shaqroum's translation, it goes something like this:
``I am Arab. I love everybody. And all the people. But if somebody
try to hit me, I'm going to eat his meat.''
</P>
<P>
   His dreams of riches were fading this spring when his future
junior partner wandered in. Tired of cruising Internet pornography
sites at the public library, Tremayne was looking for something
new. ``I kept asking Mo could I work here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the answer was no. ``But Tremayne, he kept coming
back,'' Shaqroum said. Unable to dissuade the boy, the grocer tried
to disgust him. He made him carry rancid meat to the Dumpster and
mop the bathroom floor. The pay was erratic, if there was any pay
at all.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the AOAB's efforts were erratic too: He was better
known for his insubordinate patter than his perseverance with a
broom. But Shaqroum liked the company. ``Some days are boring for
me,'' he said. ``He makes every day fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fast Deal's fast demise left both partners in a foul mood.
Even as the end neared, Shaqroum was still pondering a fight to
keep his lease. Then the roof literally caved in. With rain pouring
onto his floors, he decided it was time to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be grocerying today, boy,'' the AOAB said when
reporting on his final day. It proved to be false cheer. A
half-hour later he was baiting two teen-age girls a full head
taller than he. ``Hey, gay girls!'' he said, shadowboxing in their
direction. They chased him to the back of the store, opened an
empty soda cooler and tried to stuff his 4-foot-6-inch frame
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Shaqroum exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tremayne,'' he said, ``go home! Go home! You're going to break
the cooler!''
</P>
<P>
   The AOAB paused as if to check his disbelieving ears. Then he
bolted from the store. A neighbor found him in the parking lot a
few minutes later, his body racked with sobs. She led him back
inside, where Shaqroum's head was buried in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to stop playing and work!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate you,'' Tremayne replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wipe your eye, don't cry like a girl,'' Shaqroum said.
</P>
<P>
   They were partners once again.
</P>
<P>
   In the twilight of his short career, the AOAB was
uncharacteristically quiet. He finished unloading the cooler,
leaving a neat stack of soft drinks for the wholesaler to
repossess. Shaqroum gave him a severance package _ a $5 bill _ and
the young man snapped it in the air.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to say who fought harder to avoid a humiliating
new outbreak of tears. Shaqroum locked the front door and climbed
into his car. But he promised to return the following day to finish
dismantling the store.
</P>
<P>
   The AOAB briefly brightened. ``I'll see you tomorrow,'' he said.
Then he walked across the empty parking lot, heading nowhere in
particular.

THERMO ELECTRON PLANS TO SELL OR SHUT SEVERAL BUSINESSES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No longer will the Thermo Electron Corp. operate a network of
spas that offer hair removal by laser. Gone will be its
once-promising Wyoming plant that scrubs coal to make it burn more
cleanly. And the company will jettison a European business set up
to convert contaminated petroleum into usable oil products.
</P>
<P>
   In a tacit acknowledgment that a number of its far-flung
ventures have failed to produce the expected returns, Thermo
Electron said Monday it would sell or shut down several businesses,
write off $450 million of assets and reduce its publicly traded
subsidiaries to 11 from 23. It had previously said it would cut the
number to 15.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements come just two weeks after a leading
shareholder urged the company, which is based in Waltham, Mass., to
accelerate its reorganization and three days before Thermo Electron
executives are expected to face vigorous questioning at the
company's annual meeting. Thermo Electron's stock has lost 44
percent of its value in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The new reorganization plan is likely to depress earnings for
the second quarter and much of the rest of the year, said Richard
F. Syron, a director who will become Thermo Electron's president
and chief executive on June 1. He declined to elaborate on the
reorganization's effect on earnings, but he said that the company
expected to reap about $200 million in cash from the sale of
various businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to do a lot of things,'' Syron said. ``I think
we will have a difficult second quarter and it will be a very
challenging year over all.''
</P>
<P>
   Syron said that Thermo Electron executives met last week with
representatives of Franklin Mutual Advisers, the mutual fund
management company owned by Franklin Resources that urged the
company in a letter on May 7 to move more aggressively in
overhauling the board and the company's structure and operations.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the new reorganization moves were already in the
works before the company received the letter from Franklin, which
at the start of the month owned about 2 percent of Thermo Electron.
``I believe this announcement goes in the direction they were
suggesting,'' Syron said.
</P>
<P>
   David E. Marcus, a senior vice president at Franklin, called the
reorganization plan ``a step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to address some, but not all, of our issues,'' he
added. ``We do intend to explore further steps with the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Thermo Electron also said Monday it had named Samuel W. Bodman
3d, chairman and chief executive of the Cabot Corp., a specialty
chemicals and energy company, to the Thermo board. In addition, the
company formed a new corporate governance and nominating committee,
which is responsible for reviewing director performance and
nominating future directors.
</P>
<P>
   According to the new reorganization plan, four publicly traded
subsidiaries will be reabsorbed into Thermo Electron. Shareholders
of three of those _ Thermolase, Thermotrex and Thermo Ecotek _ are
to receive Thermo Electron shares in exchange for their shares,
while shareholders of the fourth, Thermo Vision, will receive cash.
</P>
<P>
   Thermo Electron said the amounts of shares or cash would be
determined in consultation with investment bankers. The plans are
subject to shareholder approval.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it would sell businesses that have
combined annual sales of about $350 million. Syron called those
operations, which were once promoted as important parts of the
company's strategy and expansion, ``outside our core
competencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them are the Wyoming coal-scrubbing plant and the European
oil-processing operation. In addition, the company will sell a
power electronics and test-equipment business _ part of the
company's Thermedics subsidiary _ and its Thermolyte unit, which
was trying to develop propane-powered lighting products for
recreational use.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the $450 million of charges is $105 million related
to the closing of the hair-removal spas, the write-off of the
lasers used in the hair removal procedures and closing of two
manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
   Syron said that the company did not plan to reconsider a
five-year, $2.5 million consulting agreement with John N.
Hatsopoulos, the former chief financial officer and brother of
George N. Hatsopoulos, the company's founder and chairman. That
agreement has been severely criticized by the Franklin managers,
who questioned whether John Hatsopoulos would make future
contributions worth that amount.
</P>
<P>
   The company's current proxy statement describes the agreement as
an ``ongoing consulting relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But Syron said, ``I think you do have to look at a substantial
component of that as payment for how much John Hatsopoulos has
added to the company over the entire span he has been working
here.''

GORE BACKS FEDERAL MONEY FOR CHURCH SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At a campaign stop in Atlanta Monday, Vice President
Al Gore said churches and other religion-based groups should be
eligible in certain instances to receive federal money to help
fight homelessness, substance abuse, youth violence and other
social ills.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, while lacking details, was an intriguing departure
for a Democratic candidate because the party is typically
associated with support for a strict separation between church and
state. Indeed, the closest existing program _ a 1996 provision that
allows government financing of religion-based welfare-to-work
initiatives _ was championed by Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, considered the leading contender for the Democratic
nomination in 2000, took pains in his speech at a Salvation Army
center here to say that that he believed strongly in the separation
of church and state, which he said had been ``good for all
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that national leaders had been trapped in a
dead-end debate about the role religion should play in solving the
country's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some on the right have said for too long that a specific set
of religious values should be imposed, threatening the founders'
precious separation of church and state,'' Gore said. ``In
contrast, some on the left have said for too long that religious
values should play no role in addressing public needs. These are
false choices: hollow secularism or right-wing religion. Both
positions are rigid. They are not where solutions lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that if elected president he would propose expanding
the welfare-to-work program, known as Charitable Choice, as long as
certain safeguards defined what he said would be ``carefully
tailored partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   Government, he said, must never promote a particular religious
view or try to force anyone to receive faith. There must always be
an alternative choice of high-quality secular programs. Direct
proselytizing would be prohibited as part of any publicly financed
effort. And Gore said that the government would demand financial
accountability of churches just as it does of other social service
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said he had been persuaded that faith is often
``essential to spark a personal transformation and to keep that
person from falling back into addiction, delinquency or
dependency.'' And he added that if he is elected President, ``the
voices of faith-based organizations will be integral to the
policies set forth in my administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry W. Lynn, the executive director of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, said that his group was considering
challenging the charitable choice concept in a lawsuit and warned
that Gore's proposal raised ``serious constitutional issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxpayer dollars should not be used to pay for programs that
promote religion or allow discrimination in hiring,'' Lynn said.
``Charitable choice does just that.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Atlanta, Gore met privately with most of the victims of
Thursday's school shooting in nearby Conyers, as well as with their
families and school officials. He was endorsed by Gov. Roy E.
Barnes at a campaign fund-raiser here Monday night that was
expected to generate $350,000.

   TECHNOLOGY SHARES LEAD A BROAD MARKET SELLOFF
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices staged a broad, steep selloff, led by big declines
in Internet and technology issues. It was the third consecutive
decline for stocks, and some analysts said the market, which has
charged ahead for much of the year, might be in the midst of a
correction.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 174.61 points, or 1.6
percent, to 10,654.67. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell
23.64 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,306.65. The Nasdaq composite
index dropped 66.48 points, or 2.6 percent, to 2,453.66.

</P>
<P>
   Cendant agreed to sell its automobile fleet unit to Avis Rent a
Car in a deal that raises the company's stake in Avis to 34 percent
from 19 percent. Avis, the nation's No. 2 car rental company after
Hertz, will pay $1.44 billion in cash and $360 million in
convertible preferred stock and assume $3.2 billion in Cendant debt

 EDITORIAL: UNDERMINING THE LATIN PRESS  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, May 25:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been a champion of freedom of the
press in Latin America. So it is dismaying to see Washington
sponsoring a declaration in the Organization of American States
that would endorse limits on media freedoms. The draft declaration,
which seems to be a fumble by the administration rather than a
policy reversal, has been approved by the ambassadors of the 34
member nations. It should be withdrawn. When hemisphere foreign
ministers meet next month, they should not be asked to approve a
declaration that would give governments license for further
restrictions on Latin America's besieged journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The draft was written and introduced by the American mission to
the OAS last year and then was modified by some of the governments
most hostile to press freedom, including Mexico and Peru. Press
freedom groups were not consulted. The declaration also contains
many points that retreat from previous strong statements on press
freedoms signed by hemisphere governments.
</P>
<P>
   The draft condemns some kinds of prepublication censorship, but
accepts others. It also states that press freedoms can be limited
``under domestic law.'' But in many countries, the most serious
threat to press freedom comes from restrictive laws. Seventeen
countries, for example, make it illegal to show contempt for public
officials. These laws are used to prosecute and jail journalists
who publish information about official corruption and abuses _ even
when the information is true.
</P>
<P>
   The draft also seems to endorse laws that let governments set
standards for fairness and truth in reporting. That invites
intimidation and control. Latin American journalists increasingly
face lawsuits and jail when they do aggressive reporting. The
Clinton administration and the OAS should fight for them, not make
their job harder.  &QL;

NYSE PLANS TO BEGIN EXPANDED TRADING HOURS THIS SUMMER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Stock Exchange, which had been planning
to expand its trading hours next year, is accelerating its
timetable and could commence evening sessions as soon as this
summer, the exchange's chairman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Richard Grasso, has said for several months that
the Big Board would probably move to extend its trading hours by
the summer of next year, allowing the exchange and its member
institutions time to safely navigate the Year 2000 date change. But
at a news conference Monday, Grasso said, in response to questions,
that ``it is very clear to me that our timetable has got to be
accelerated.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the issue will ``clearly be discussed'' at the exchange
board's meeting on June 3, with the board asked to give its formal
authorization to the proposal ``as early as July of this year.''
Typically, the board does not meet in July and August, but Grasso
said that the extraordinary array of competitive issues now facing
the exchange could well require summer meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Those competitive pressures include a proposal by the Nasdaq
market, run by the National Association of Securities Dealers, to
add evening sessions to its trading hours. That plan is expected to
be discussed by Nasdaq officials this week, for possible enactment
by midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   Also scheduled for introduction in the coming months is Indivex,
an after-hours trading service for individual investors operated by
Eclipse Trading. The fledgling service has already signed on
Discover Brokerage, a unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter; Dreyfus
Brokerage Services, an affiliate of Mellon Bank, and some large
Nasdaq market makers, including Herzog Heine Geduld.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Instinet, a unit of Reuters Group PLC, has said
recently that it is considering opening its institution-only
trading system to individuals who want to trade when traditional
markets are closed. Instinet is the oldest and by far the largest
of the alternative trading services now in operation.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso said Monday he and his staff still have significant
concerns about whether there would be sufficient trading volume
during evening hours to make such sessions attractive to investors.
``We have to consider whether consumers are going to be helped or
hurt'' by trading when volume is reduced, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By accelerating his pursuit of a decision on longer trading
hours, Grasso adds to an agenda that already includes another
crucial competitive decision facing the exchange: whether to
develop an alternative trading service of its own to compete with
the growing roster of private electronic communications networks,
or ECNs, which now account for nearly a third of all trades in
Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso said Monday that a number of ideas remain under study,
including the possible creation of a ``super ECN,'' a
computer-based trading system with ``an open architecture'' that
would allow other ECNs to participate.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected the exchange to reach a decision on an ECN
arrangement ``in the next few months.''

FEW ASSURANCES IN TRIP INSURANCE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Wash.)   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Builders warn that there is no standard-sized window. There is
likewise no standard trip-cancellation insurance policy. Recent
events have raised questions that expose widening differences among
the popular policies sold to protect travelers against lost
payments if they cannot take a trip, tour or cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The American Airlines pilots' 10-day sickout in February
affected 600,000 travelers by the airline's count, and caused many
people to miss connections to cruises and tours. Trans World
Airlines similarly canceled 200 flights over Christmas, including
90 on Christmas Day, when flight attendants called in sick. Were
these job actions strikes as defined in cancellation policies, and
did the insurance underwriters refund any or all of the
policyholders' lost payments?
</P>
<P>
   The conflict over Kosovo has had a multiple impact in areas far
removed from the warfare. First, it is causing cruise and tour
companies to alter itineraries in the Adriatic and on European
river cruises. Then, when the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade was
bombed, the United States Embassy in Beijing and consulates
elsewhere in China were subject to violent demonstrations,
Americans were harassed and United States businesses there damaged.
</P>
<P>
   On May 9, the State Department issued an official warning
advising against travel to China; this was rescinded on May 13. How
did the insurance companies respond to policyholders who canceled
under these circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   And what about an event for which there is no precedent? Travel
companies of all sorts have been selling high-priced packages for
the end of the millennium: cruises, hotel stays in Paris or New
York, global air trips. The sellers are linking their higher prices
to much tighter cancellation deadlines and severe penalties for
later cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Many hotel packages provide for no refund at all in the event of
cancellation. How are insurance companies dealing with exposure to
losses over as many as 15 months?
</P>
<P>
   Although these situations represent only part of what
trip-cancellation insurance may cover _ or not _ the message is to
research insurance as soon as you are ready to pay a deposit for a
major travel expenditure. Timing is important. If there is a chance
that a family member's existing medical problem may cause a change
in plans, insurance must be bought promptly after the first
deposit; the window periods are specified on the fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Then read the small type carefully because the administrator of
the insurance policy will normally take the narrowest possible
interpretation of the language. If the language says ``broken
leg,'' it does not mean broken arm, hip or rib.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of hewing to the line became a big issue some years
ago when several large tour operators shut their doors and decamped
with their customers' deposits. Some insurance companies would not
pay their policyholders because the insurance provided benefits
only if the defaulting company declared bankruptcy, and most never
did. After the burst of defaults, many insurance companies changed
the policy language to encompass a company's cessation of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Results of a quick survey of six companies show the wide
differences in small-type language and in its interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Finkle, president of one of these companies, Trip Mate,
discussing the China questions, said the policies his company
prepares for tour operators generally did not pay benefits to
policyholders who canceled their trips because the State Department
issued a warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the situation is bad enough,'' he said, ``the operator will
change the itinerary or give refunds.'' State Department warnings
come in many modulations, he said, and other government cautionary
notices may be reports of disease outbreaks from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkely Group, according to Christina E. Hopper, a vice
president, does not write its policies to cover cancellation for a
government travel warning. Travel Insured also does not cover this
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   One acceptable _ ``covered'' _ reason for canceling a trip, as
described in Travelex's literature, is couched in this opaque
language: ``Terrorism in a country which is part of the Covered
Trip which causes the United States Department of State to issue a
travel warning that You should not travel within that country for a
period of time that would include the Covered Trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Ambrose, a vice president, said this meant that
losses of money would be covered if a traveler canceled a trip to
China during the period of the warning or before the warning was
issued if the trip included the May 9-13 period.
</P>
<P>
   While Travel Guard will pay benefits in the event of
``documented terrorism'' in the destination country, Dan McGinnity,
a spokesman, said that this did not apply in the China case. This
company's terrorism definition says, ``Terrorism does not include
general civil protest, unrest, rioting, or an act of war,'' and it
relies on sources like The Wall Street Journal to report its
existence. Travel Insured also does not pay in the event of civil
disturbances even if there is a government warning issued on a
country.
</P>
<P>
   Access America, according to Beth L. Godlin, senior vice
president, was covering losses in cancellations because of a State
Department travel warning, although its language does not
specifically say it. Ms. Godlin said that it was covered by
implication because the insurance says that cancellations for the
State Department's less serious travel advisories, bulletins or
alerts are specifically not covered.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about changes of itinerary in the Adriatic, insurance
officials said they did not recall receiving many claims. Most
travel and cruise companies' contracts reserve the right to change
an itinerary _ although not usually substantially _ without making
refunds. If a traveler was taking the trip specifically to visit
someone in Dubrovnik, and that port of call was eliminated, the
insurance experts said the traveler probably should be talking to
the cruise line.
</P>
<P>
   When the Adriatic port changes were first announced after the
NATO bombing began, some companies _ for instance, Euro Cruises _
offered refunds directly, or offered to let customers select a
later cruise.
</P>
<P>
   For those who change their mind about a trip for any reason,
Travel Guard provides a modest benefit: up to $250 against lost
payments, regardless of the reason for cancellation. To get this,
the traveler must buy the coverage within seven days of paying an
initial deposit.
</P>
<P>
   The American Airlines and TWA labor actions were a classic
sticky wicket. In the American pilots' action, Travel Guard refused
to pay because its language refers to ``an unforeseen organized
labor strike'' and Travel Guard initially said this did not cover
the 10-day sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Myers, owner of Tickets and Travel in Houston, had 10
Austin high school clients making a ski trip on Feb. 11; six of
them arrived in Colorado a day late and four never got out of Texas
because of American's cancellations. They held Travel Guard
policies, and the next day, when the company would not pay, Myers
wrote the company to protest, sending a copy to Travel Weekly, a
trade publication. On Feb. 17, Travel Guard issued a press release
saying it would make an exception and reimburse the policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   John Noel, the chief executive officer of Travel Guard, said:
``We stepped in to make sure that they are compensated for
nonrefundable travel expenses that other companies are refusing to
cover.'' McGinnity emphasized that this was an exception.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Access America's language says it covers losses when ``strikes,
natural disasters or bad weather'' result in the complete cessation
of services by an airline or tour operator for at least 24 hours.
Initially, it also refused to pay claims for the American sickout,
including one from Bernard and Barbara Willett of Jericho, N.Y.,
who missed a Panama Canal cruise booked through ABC Tours of
Bloomfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Willett was particularly outraged because the couple going with
them did collect through Travel Insured.
</P>
<P>
   The Willetts' lawyer wrote the New York State Insurance
Department, citing law-dictionary definitions of ``strike.'' Access
America is paying on these claims, Ms. Godlin said, and last
Monday, Willett said he had received a check for $1,693, the price
of the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Berkely policies usually cover such events under the ``trip
delay'' provision, Ms. Hopper said. Trip Mate, Finkle said, pays
when there is a formally called strike or lockout, not job actions.
Travelex, according to Sally Dunlap, a vice president, decided that
because the American sickout was of such long duration, it would
pay claims for those who had no alternative route.
</P>
<P>
   None of the experts remembered paying any claims as a result of
the TWA sickout. TWA said that it accommodated travelers any way it
could on other lines, with tickets for later flights and with
vouchers, and that it believes that many of its customers held only
airline tickets, not tour packages or hotel reservations, because
they were trying to get home for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium reservations business is a unique situation.
Agencies, operators, expensive hotels and exotic locales are
furiously marketing all sorts of unusual travel to mark the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   One traveler was thinking about a millennial cruise as far back
as 1997, his travel agent said. After an early false start, this
traveler, Louis H. Barnett of Fort Worth, made a new choice in the
summer of 1998: a family cruise to celebrate his wife's 75th
birthday on Dec. 31, 1999. On July 24, he paid a $13,000 deposit on
seven cabins on the Statendam of Holland America Lines, which
leaves Dec. 23 this year on a 16-day cruise from San Diego to
Hawaii and back.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnetts are long-time cruise-takers, and Barnett, 80, an
investor, called his regular travel agent, Jay Silberman of Cruise
Consultants in San Antonio. The total for the trip, Silberman said,
was imposing: the six cabins for 11 family members were $19,500
each, and the suite Barnett reserved for himself and his wife was
$28,000.
</P>
<P>
   Silberman said that he suggested buying the Holland America
Cancellation Protection Plan, which is actually a waiver of
penalties in the event of cancellation, rather than insurance. This
is not inexpensive: Silberman said the plan's cost for the suite
alone would have been $1,400 _ $700 for each of the senior
Barnetts. They turned this down.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 15, 1998, 14 months before the cruise, the deadline for
cancellation passed, according to the line. On Nov. 16, Barnett
canceled the reservation, having discovered, he said, that some of
the grandchildren would not have time for a 16-day cruise, and that
others wanted to go elsewhere. Silberman said he spoke to the line
``probably 20 times,'' but the deadline was immutable.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett proposed that the line apply the deposit to some other
cruise. Silberman said that his client also proposed giving the
money to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Cole C. Quinn of Holland America's executive office in Seattle
wrote to Barnett on Feb. 1 that although the situation was
``unfortunate, our cancellation policies are clearly stated, and
apply to everyone equally.'' On May 20, a spokesman for the cruise
line said that the line stood by its position on the matter, saying
that 200 cabins on this cruise remained unsold.
</P>
<P>
   Although insurance was not an issue here _ Barnett could have
also bought cancellation insurance if he had wished _ the insurance
officials all said that the penalties for canceling reservations
for millennial events were very severe, even in relation to usual
penalties on Christmas-New Year's cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Finkle said that the cost of the insurance was running about
double the average. The premiums, as filed with most state
insurance departments, cannot be raised for the occasion _ $5.50
for each $100 of coverage is usual _ but the costs of the trips are
high and the cancellation penalties are being enforced swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Cruises at premium prices are selling briskly for the December
holidays. Cancellation insurance is probably a good course, whether
you buy direct from the company or from a travel agent or take a
policy offered by the tour or cruise organization. But you will
have to make your best guess as to which part of the policy will be
the important one if you miss your trip. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Six insurers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are the companies whose officials were interviewed about
their trip-cancellation policies:
</P>
<P>
   Access America, of Richmond, a division of World Access, sells
policies under its own name and also prepares policies for travel
operators' labels. Its underwriter is the BCS Co.; (800) 284-8300.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkely Group, Garden City, N.Y., sells policies under the
brand name Carefree and administers policies for travel operators
and cruise companies, including Carnival, Abercrombie &AMP; Kent and
Mountain Travel-Sobek. Its main underwriter is the National Union
Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, a division of American
International in New York; (800) 323-3149.
</P>
<P>
   Travel Guard, Stevens Point, Wis., a division of the Noel Group,
sells under its own name and also provides policies for operators
and travel-agent consortiums to put their own names on. Cigna is
the underwriter; (800) 826-1300.
</P>
<P>
   Travel Insured, East Hartford, Conn., is underwritten by the
Travelers Insurance Co.; (800) 243-3174.
</P>
<P>
   Travelex, which was Mutual of Omaha before it was bought by a
currency exchange company, is still in Omaha. The underwriter is
TIG Insurance; (800) 797-4515.
</P>
<P>
   Trip Mate, Kansas City, Mo., prepares policies only for sale by
tour operators, including Globus Tours, Insight, Trafalgar and
Grand Circle. It uses several underwriters, including Monumental
General Casualty in Baltimore. It does not sell retail policies.

N.Y. POLICE OFFICER WILL PLEAD GUILTY TO ASSAULTING IMMIGRANT
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ROBERT McFADDEN and JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Confronted with devastating testimony by fellow
officers and a crumbling defense, the police officer accused of
torturing a Haitian immigrant in the bathroom of a Brooklyn station
house in 1997 will plead guilty to all charges Tuesday and throw
himself on the mercy of the court, his lawyer told a federal judge
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With an overwhelming case against him and with prosecutors
rejecting any plea bargain, the officer, Justin A. Volpe, appeared
to have no choice but to admit that he rammed a broom handle into
the rectum and then into the mouth of the handcuffed man, Abner
Louima, in a fit of rage. Volpe could be sentenced to a prison term
ranging from 25 years to life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to enter a plea tomorrow,'' Officer Volpe's
lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, told Judge Eugene H. Nickerson in
federal court in Brooklyn in a quiet conference of defense lawyers
and prosecutors at the bench Monday afternoon, signaling that his
client had abandoned all but the hope of leniency.
</P>
<P>
   While the trial of four other officers accused in the case was
expected to continue, a guilty plea by Volpe would end his
involvement in the most explosive New York police brutality episode
in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Monday night that he would withhold
comment until the plea was entered, and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir also declined to comment. The mayor and the commissioner,
often outspoken in their defense of police officers, have been
silent in the Louima case.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the other defendants indicated that they were
prepared to go on with the trial. Kornberg declined to comment on
whether Volpe would testify for the prosecution, or whether, in
offering his plea, he would implicate any of the others. Other
lawyers in the case said it was not likely that he would testify,
and what he will disclose in his plea appeared to be up to the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition of pleading guilty, legal experts said, Volpe
would be required to detail his actions on the morning of Aug. 9,
1997, when, officials charge, he and Officers Charles Schwarz,
Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder beat Louima in a patrol car before
taking him to the 70th Precinct station house, where Schwarz
allegedly held him down while Volpe sodomized him.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which Volpe will tell his story _ whether the
actions of other officers will be detailed or even cited, for
example _ will be up to Judge Nickerson, lawyers said. But legal
experts said that to ensure that the continuing trial of the other
officers would not be tainted, the judge was not likely to require
any statements by Volpe of their involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Volpe's statement in open court, which will take
place in the absence of the jury, could amount to a dramatic
confession of his own purported brutality, a story that has already
been told in testimony by Louima, 32, who suffered severe rectal
and bladder injuries and underwent several operations and months of
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   By pleading guilty to violating Louima's civil rights in a
sexual assault, Volpe, 27, would expose himself to a maximum
sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole. But under
complex federal sentencing guidelines, Nickerson, by applying all
provisions for leniency including Volpe's acceptance of
responsibility for his actions, could impose a term of as little as
25 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts noted that the judge would have wide discretion in
sentencing. Prosecutors were expected to argue against leniency on
the ground that Volpe decided to plead guilty only after he saw the
overwhelming case against him as fellow officers in the past week
told of hearing him brag of the assault and seeing him brandish the
stick stained with blood and feces.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Technically, Nickerson could reject a guilty plea if he thought
it served the interest of justice, but lawyers said that was not
likely in view of the testimony in recent days by Sgt. Kenneth
Wernick, Detective Eric Turetzky and Officers Mark Schofield and
Michael Schoer.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky last week testified that he saw Volpe lead a handcuffed
Louima, whose pants were down at his ankles, to the bathroom of the
station house, and later that he saw Volpe, disheveled and sullen,
swinging a stick around ``like a sword and hitting it against a
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Schofield testified that he, too, saw Volpe with a stick and
said he had borrowed a pair of black leather gloves before the
alleged attack and later gave them back, covered with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg, who had said at the outset of the trial that Louima's
injuries had been caused by consensual sex at a nightclub before a
melee that led to his arrest, and other defense lawyers vigorously
attacked the credibility of both police witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense appeared to be taken by surprise last Wednesday
when Wernick testified, in an account that had not been made public
previously, that Volpe had bragged about the attack, saying ``I
took a man down tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant said Volpe told him he ``took a stick and put it
five or six inches up (Louima's rectum), took it out and put it up
to his mouth and teeth area, kind of like showing it to him.'' He
said Volpe also showed him the section of broomstick, two to three
feet long, in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   After first saying he intended to cross-examine Wernick,
Kornberg reversed himself and asked no questions. He also did not
cross-examine Schoer, who testified that Volpe had taunted him by
putting the excrement-tainted stick near his face.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A conciliatory Dave Checketts acknowledged Monday
that he met with Phil Jackson nearly six weeks ago, after denying
on Sunday that he had made contact with the former Bulls coach for
exploratory talks about potentially coming to the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts, the Madison Square Garden president, also said that
he met with the Knicks' coach, Jeff Van Gundy, earlier in the day
and apologized to him for making misleading statements about
meeting with Jackson. Speaking at a news conference before Game 4
of the Eastern Conference semifinal at the Garden Monday night,
Checketts appeared contrite and remorseful about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   But he also did not quell the speculation surrounding Van
Gundy's status as coach, saying he and Van Gundy agreed to discuss
the matter after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took over with eight games left to go in the regular
season, my goal with the Knicks team and the coaches was to
eliminate the distractions I felt were getting in the way of the
team accomplishing what it could accomplish,'' said Checketts, who
reassigned Ernie Grunfeld, general manager and team president, on
April 21. ``And I've tried very hard to do that. But when we were
21-21 and having lost four in a row, I reached out through an
intermediary and contacted Phil Jackson, and I set up a meeting
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did meet. We met for a couple of hours. There were no
offers exchanged. There was nothing that came out of the meeting,
other than getting acquainted with a guy that I felt was a
tremendous option for us, if in fact we continued the season the
way it was going and didn't make the playoffs and we needed a new
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I did meet with him. I regret that I lied about that, that
I misled the press and Jeff Van Gundy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, during the nationally televised game between the
Atlanta Hawks and Knicks, Checketts denied a report in The New York
Times that morning that Checketts had met with Jackson in
mid-April. After the game, through a spokesman, he continued to
deny the meeting but acknowledged contacting Jackson through an
intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson could not reached for comment. His agent, Todd
Musburger, who also attended the meeting with Checketts, declined
to comment.

</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years in the making, MASS MoCA, a campus for
contemporary art in North Adams, Mass., is set to open Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   MASS MoCA, which calls itself the largest center for
contemporary visual and performing arts in the United States, plans
to focus on artists charting new territory, works that blur the
line between visual and performing arts, and works that have seldom
been seen because of their size or material.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-acre site includes 27 disused factory buildings, though
so far only 6 have been renovated. Dating from the 19th century,
the complex once belonged to the O. Arnold and Co. print works and
later to Sprague Electric Co. Listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, the red-brick structures are joined by bridges,
viaducts and elevated walkways to form an elaborate system of
interlocking courtyards, an architectural vision in itself. They
occupy nearly a third of North Adams' downtown business district.
</P>
<P>
   Transformed, the buildings are now home to 19 galleries with
more than 100,000 square feet of exhibition space, including one as
long as a football field; a 650-seat theater; an outdoor cinema
with a 50-foot-wide screen; two performance courtyards; an art
workshop, and fabrication facilities, including areas that allow
visitors to watch artists create.
</P>
<P>
   For its opening MASS MoCA has scheduled a broad range of
programs; most are scheduled to run for at least several months.
Among them: a group exhibition of works by Robert Rauschenberg,
Joseph Beuys, Mario Merz and other artists; a new commissioned work
by Tony Oursler, the video artist; a large-scale installation by
Natalie Jeremijenko; and ``Ghostcatching,'' which uses digital
motion-capture technology to multiply the dancing of Bill T. Jones
into an interactive ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an animation series, which on July 10 features a
Walt Disney Pictures project in development, and an exhibition that
brings together drawings by the dancer Trisha Brown and the painter
Terry Winters, among others. Christina Kubisch has created a sound
work for MASS MoCA's clock tower.
</P>
<P>
   MASS MoCA, at 87 Marshall Street in North Adams, is about three
hours by car from both New York and Boston. The center is open
daily; admission is $8. For more information: (413) 664-4481. On
the Internet: www.massmoca.org.

   Michelin Teams Mexico With Belize, Guatemala &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michelin has published its first combined tourist guide to
Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. Mexico had a Green Guide of its own,
last reissued in 1990, and the two smaller countries until now had
none. The new volume, in the familiar paperback pocket-width
format, devotes some 310 pages to Mexico, 26 to Guatemala and 18 to
tiny English-speaking Belize.
</P>
<P>
   The book rates attractions in Michelin's usual way: one star for
``interesting,'' two for ``worth a detour'' and three for ``worth
the trip.'' Belize's reefs and Lamanai archeological site rate
three stars, as do the Tikal archeological zone and the ancient
capital of Antigua in Guatemala. Mexico has many three-star spots.
</P>
<P>
   Advice on safety is sparse; it mostly concerns the hazards of
nature and the sun, although the United States Embassy's precaution
against hailing taxis on the streets of Mexico City is noted.
</P>
<P>
   The book, with a large number of small maps and modest color
pictures, is published in English, Spanish or French and costs $20.
Michelin outlet information: (800) 223-0987. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Hilton Hanoi Opera hotel has opened, a few blocks from Hoa
Lo, the infamous ``Hanoi Hilton'' where American prisoners were
held during the Vietnam War. (The few remaining cells of that
prison have been preserved as a museum.) The seven-story classical
facade of the new hotel resembles its more immediate neighbor, the
newly restored 1911 French colonial Hanoi Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood is within walking distance of the city's
central business district. Guest rooms, furnished with lacquered
cabinets and Vietnamese art, have individually controlled
air-conditioning, data ports and television with international
channels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a fitness center, whirlpool, sauna and massage, and the
outdoor pool has its own bar. Dining choices include a cafe, a bar,
a brasserie with French specialties and a Cantonese restaurant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hotel has 269 rooms and suites. A special promotional rate
of $111 for a double (you must book at least three days in advance)
is good through Sept. 15; the standard rate is $155. Tax of 15
percent is extra. &QL;
</P>

JUSTICES PULL PLUG ON TELEVISED POLICE RAIDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a decision that could put a damper on televised
police raids, the Supreme Court ruled Monday that police officers
can be sued for allowing the media to accompany them on authorized
searches of private homes.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the justices agreed that so-called
media ride-alongs with police violate the Fourth Amendment
protections against unreasonable or unlawful searches.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was in response to two cases, from Maryland and
Montana, where officials were sued after they allowed members of
the media to accompany them on searches of private property.
</P>
<P>
   The court, however, held that the officers involved in the two
challenged searches could not be sued because the courts had not
previously established such actions as unconstitutional. The cases
occurred in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In writing for the court, Chief Justice William Rehnquist
emphasized the historic roots of the Fourth Amendment, which he
said ``embodies this centuries old principle of respect for the
privacy of the home.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice argued that while raids of homes are sometimes
necessary, police do not need to bring journalists or photographers
along to carry out their mission.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist also dismissed arguments by the police and media
organizations that having reporters along served the public because
it helped promote crime fighting efforts and deterred police from
abusive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely the possibility of good public relations for the police
is simply not enough, standing alone, to justify the ride-along
intrusion into a home,'' the chief justice stated. ``And even the
need for accurate reporting on police issues in general bears no
direct relation to the constitutional justification for the police
intrusion into a home in order to execute a felony arrest
warrant.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court's action will affect the spate of ``reality-based
television'' shows such as Fox network's popular ``Cops'' that
features live footage of police raids.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty four news organizations had filed a friend of the court
brief siding with the police officials.
</P>
<P>
   The media organizations argued that restricted access to such
raids would erode ``public understanding of government law
enforcement activities in a manner inimical to the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Monday's ruling a number of police departments have
moved to restrict live coverage of raids. The Los Angeles Police
Department issued guidelines in March that bars television cameras
from entering homes and other private property without the owners'
permission.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Police Department does not allow the media to
accompany them on raids, according to spokesman Robert Hurst. He
said the policy had been in effect at least as long as C.O.
Bradford had been chief of the department.
</P>
<P>
   The justices spelled out their rationale in a Maryland case
involving police authorities who allowed a Washington Post reporter
and photographer to accompany them when they entered the Rockville
home of Charles and Geraldine Wilson early one morning in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery County sheriff's deputies and deputy U.S.
marshals had been looking for the Wilson's son, Dominic, who had
violated his parole on several felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   But Dominic Wilson was not at the home at the time of the search
and instead the police awakened his parents. The police initially
confused the father with the son and subdued him while his wife
watched.
</P>
<P>
   During the incident the Post photographer took numerous
pictures, including one showing Wilson in his undershorts with a
police officer's gun to his head. The photographs were never
published.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilsons sued the police officers, but the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals threw out their lawsuit. The Supreme Court agreed
with the lower court's ruling that the officers could not be sued,
saying that until Monday they had not established the media
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The court came to the same conclusion in another case involving
a Montana rancher and his wife who sued after federal agents let a
Cable News Network reporter and camera crew accompany them on raid
of their property.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, about 20 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents had
raided the sheep and cattle ranch of Paul and Erma Berger searching
for evidence of eagle poisoning. Berger was acquitted of all
charges except the improper use of a pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   CNN used footage of the raid in a segment on government efforts
to protect endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Montana
couple could sue government officials as well as CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Once again the Supreme Court ruled that while such a search was
in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the officials involved in the
Montana raid could not be sued because they could have reasonably
believed that they were within their constitutional bounds to
invite the media along.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice John Paul Stevens differed from his colleagues
on the question of whether the officers in the two cases should be
held liable. In a lone dissent, Stevens wrote that the
constitutional principle guiding police searches was not a new one.

 &UR; MANAGE  &LR; _ Opera is the fastest growing performing art in America
and the only one attracting younger audiences. But it has a
problem. Nationally, 24 percent of seats at opera performances go
unsold, representing at least $70 million in lost revenue. That's
money badly needed by the nation's 113 professional opera companies
that rely on rich benefactors to cover nearly half their costs.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder, then, that the annual Opera World conference in

 Short Shelf Life, Big Bargains  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
As revenue management systems spread to more industries, flexible,
attentive consumers may find bargains on all sorts of perishable
commodities, ranging from theater seats to tee times.
<P>
   But consumers who are inflexible or not willing to shop around
could end up paying more.
</P>
<P>
   Although revenue management systems _ which set varying prices
based on individual customers' demand _ bring down prices overall,
the savings aren't distributed evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue management in the airline industry brought lower prices
for leisure passengers and those traveling between major hubs. But
business travelers and those taking less-traveled routes ended up
paying more.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips for consumers trying to get the most from
industries that already use revenue management _ such as airlines,
rental cars, hotels and cruise lines &LR;   &LR; _ and from others that are
just starting to experiment:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; _Buy early. Many companies offer special deals to early birds
because they want to jump-start sales and get the cash flow
generated by early purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   _Ask if small changes in your itinerary or consumption, such as
shifting to an off-peak time, can lower your price.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't take ``no'' for an answer. If a hotel says it's sold out,
it may be saving space for customers booking longer stays. Check
back as your travel date approaches. Batches of unsold rooms may be
released.
</P>
<P>
   _Shop the Internet. Some companies clear out unsold inventory by
offering special deals on the Web. Travelocity
( &LR; www.travelocity.com &LR; ) and Priceline ( &LR; www.priceline.com &LR; ) are
examples.
</P>
<P>
   _Consider joining loyalty or frequent-shopper programs so that
companies can track your usage and offer you special deals. Feel
free to ask that your privacy be respected and that information on
your personal buying habits not be shared with other vendors.

<P>
   Like her late brother Gianni, Donatella Versace is no shrinking
violet when it comes to revealing the more sensational aspects of
her public life. Ask her about her diamonds, her famous friends or
the time she flew a New York hairdresser to Milan to give her and
Naomi Campbell extensions while they ate spaghetti in Ms. Versace's
marble bathroom, and she will tell all.
</P>
<P>
   The corn-haired Ms. Versace, who assumed creative control of the
$560 million Versace fashion empire after her brother's murder in
1997, is similarly candid about her family's complex relations.
When asked in March about a rift between her and Antonio D'Amico,
Versace's companion of many years, she replied: ``My relationship
with Antonio is exactly as it was when Gianni was alive. I
respected him as the boyfriend of my brother, but I never liked him
as a person.'' Ms. Versace smiled. ``So the relationship stayed the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   But as with even the most public personalities, there are
apparently limits to what Ms. Versace and her other brother, Santo,
the oldest of the three Calabrian-born siblings and the company's
chief executive, want revealed about their family and business _
and by whom.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in New York, lawyers for the Versaces effectively
stopped the publication of a controversial biography that would
have depicted Versace as a colossal talent who, behind the
glamorous facade of palatial homes and celebrity-filled fashion
shows, bullied employees and berated journalists who wrote
unflattering reviews of his collections.
</P>
<P>
   Along with depictions of promiscuity on the part of the
designer, the book, which was in galley form and set for
publication on July 1, also painted an unflattering picture of the
lifestyles of the surviving siblings. It was this latter material
that apparently prompted the threat of legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Canceling a book so near its release date is not all that rare,
but in the case of ``Undressed: The Life and Times of Gianni
Versace,'' an unauthorized biography by Christopher Mason, the
decision by Little, Brown raises questions about the kinds of
pressure, legal and otherwise, that a powerful fashion house can
bring to bear on a publisher, an author and his sources.
</P>
<P>
   Mason maintains that in their effort to stop his book,
representatives for the Versaces got in contact with people whom he
had interviewed and tried to persuade them to recant their
statements, in some cases, he said, offering legal documents for
them to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Just why Little, Brown, a division of Time Warner, halted
publication is not clear. Michael Pietsch, the editor in chief (and
Mason's editor), declined to comment, and referred questions to a
spokeswoman. In a brief statement, she said, ``In mid-March, we
received letters'' from the Versace attorneys ``threatening legal
action.'' She added that the publisher ``agreed with Christopher
Mason that it could not be published in its present form, and he
withdrew it.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that because the book had been postponed once,
last July, and thus had appeared twice in Little, Brown's sales
catalog, the publisher was opposed to another delay that could
diminish interest in the book. ``It would be impossible for Little,
Brown to sell the book yet again,'' the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Versaces, through their press agents, Ed Filapowski in New
York and Emanuela Schmeidler in Milan, said that they were
satisfied with the decision by Little, Brown to kill the book,
which they said they had opposed from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   When it was announced by Little, Brown on the day that Versace
died that Mason had been signed to write a biography, to the
grieving Versaces the author appeared to be an opportunist. The
family members have said they further resented the inference that
Mason _ a freelance writer of style and architectural articles for
a number of publications, including The New York Times _ was a
close friend of the designer (all agree that they had met only a
few times, in 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Mason was shunned by the Versaces, and Filapowski said that his
firm sent letters to potential sources asking them not to cooperate
with him.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, at least for Mason, who accepted a
six-figure advance, he had agreed to complete the biography in six
months, and he was unable to do so, which is why the book was
shelved the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, after bound galleys of Mason's manuscript had
been sent to magazine editors for review, a report appeared in The
New York Post saying that the author had hired ghost writers to
draft chapters of his book. The suggestion that not all the
reporting was his own seemed to be another strike against Mason's
credibility. Mason said that it was the suggestion of editors that
he employ ghost writers, though he said that most of that material
was scrapped with the first draft.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Filapowski said: ``It is apparent that Little, Brown
lost confidence in this manuscript. The manuscript is full of
inaccuracies and misrepresentations and clearly could not be
salvaged. We did what anyone else would do under the circumstances,
which is to defend ourselves and our name.''
</P>
<P>
   From Milan, Ms. Schmeidler, the press agent, added that the
objections of the Versaces were not based on unflattering
depictions of the family, but rather on the veracity of Mason's
reporting. ``It's not about a good biography or a bad biography,''
she said. ``It's about a serious biography.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mason and people familiar with the legal discussions that
took place say that Little, Brown's decision to cancel the book had
little, if anything, to do with the veracity of the reporting.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Beginning last December, Mason's manuscript went through an
extensive legal review, he said, and again in early spring when
attorneys for the Versaces threatened to take legal action if
changes were not made.
</P>
<P>
   A number of changes were made, Mason said, though some of the
most unflattering material passed the initial scrutiny of Little,
Brown's lawyers. ``I felt completely confident about my reporting,
and I had substantial documentation,'' Mason said. ``I felt, sure,
we were having problems, but they could be easily surmounted.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Mason said, he began to receive ``terrifying,
withering'' phone calls from sources, about 10 in all, who he said
told him they had been reached by the Versace attorneys or family
representatives and told that they could face legal action if they
didn't recant statements they had made to Mason.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were obviously extremely scared,'' said Mason, who on the
advice of his own lawyer declined to give their names. ``I
certainly got the feeling that a lot of people were intimidated by
the implications of talking to me for this book.''
</P>
<P>
   Filapowski denied that there were any attempts to intimidate
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Mason acknowledged that his project had been dogged by problems
from the start. It had been his intention to ask Versace, whom he
visited in Miami in the spring of 1997 after writing an article
about his New York town house for The Times, to collaborate on a
book. He had planned to see Versace in August at his home near Lake
Como, in Italy, and was drafting a proposal when the designer was
killed. ``If he hadn't been interested, frankly, I don't know
whether I would have done the book,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Against his better judgment, he said, he agreed to write
``Undressed'' in six months. ``I have to admit, you know, to a
certain amount of a naivete in this,'' he continued. ``Obviously, I
wanted to do an extremely thorough, thoughtful, balanced,
scrupulously researched account of Gianni's life. No one can do a
book in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason may have been out of his depths in other ways. Without a
deep knowledge of the idiosyncratic fashion world, and because the
Versaces effectively closed off access to many of the primary
sources who could have given him greater insight into the family,
Mason's perceptions may not have been fully informed. For instance,
he seemed surprised when told of Donatella Versace's comment about
D'Amico, which is typical of her brusqueness. ``I'm amazed to hear
her say that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, after everything he has been through, he has at least seen
one reality of the fashion business. ``Image is so important to a
fashion house,'' he said. ``For the Versaces, I'm sure, it's an
economic decision. I don't think it's just vanity. It's a giant
commercial decision. It's business.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Versaces have successfully sued several
British publications for libel, winning in court or settling for
damages and a public apology.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's publisher, despite canceling his contract, paid his
advance in full, freeing him to sell the book elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He added, sounding fatalistic: ``They've won, basically. The
book isn't coming out. They won.''

 When a Stock Sale Is Short or Long Term  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I worked for a privately held company until last October
1. The month before I left, I exercised my right to buy some stock
in the company. I was granted the right in December 1997, but
didn't have the money at that time. The company says that it will
go public soon. Once it does, I intend to sell my shares. My
question is: What is my purchase date for determining whether my
sale is long term or short term? Is it the grant date, or the date
when I paid for the shares, or the date when the stock goes public?
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  It isn't the grant date, because you didn't own the
shares at that time. It isn't the date the stock will go public,
because you bought the shares before then. The date on which you
actually bought the shares is your purchase date for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, you are not entitled to long-term capital gains
treatment, because it is less than 12 months since you bought the
shares. If you bought the shares, say, last September 15, then the
earliest date for a long-term sale would be September 16, 1999. If
you are in the 28 percent bracket, you would pay a 28 percent tax
on your gain with a short-term sale, compared with 20 percent if
the sale is long term. All other things being equal, you would do
much better to sell long term.
</P>
<P>
   However, other things have a tendency not to stay equal. It
could be unwise to time your sale based on tax considerations
alone.
</P>
<P>
   You have to decide whether the prospects for the stock are good
enough to justify waiting to sell.
</P>
<P>
   For example, suppose the stock shoots up after the initial
public offering _ as stocks often do _ and you find yourself with a
short-term gain of $30 per share. If you then sold the stock, you
would pay a capital gains tax of $8.40 per share. If the stock
stayed at $30 until you qualified for long-term treatment, your tax
would be $6 per share.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the stock were to fall several points before
September? In that case, you would have outsmarted yourself. You
would have been better off taking a short-term gain.
</P>
<P>
   More on Roth IRAs
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a recent column you stated that a taxpayer who contributes
the full $2,000 annual amount to a Roth Individual Retirement
Account cannot contribute anything to traditional IRAs that same
year. But what if the traditional IRA is a nondeductible type? Can
I contribute to that and also contribute $2,000 to my Roth?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: I'm afraid not. The tax law explicitly states that the
$2,000 limit on your Roth contribution will be reduced by whatever
you contribute that same year to any traditional IRAs. So if you
max out your Roth, there's no room left for other contributions.
</P>
<P>
   I can understand why you posed the question. Since you pay taxes
up front on the money you contribute to a nondeductible IRA, you
are wondering why the government is so tight-fisted about the
amounts you can contribute.
</P>
<P>
   The reason _ you can decide for yourself whether it is a good
one _ is that your earnings on the money you contribute to a
nondeductible IRA will accumulate tax-deferred. The government
doesn't want too much tax-deferred income sitting out there,
because it has to raise enough money each year to finance the many,
wonderful federal services and programs that benefit us all.
</P>
<P>
   Tax on Gift of Stock
</P>
<P>
   Q: I own some stock that has gone up in value since I bought it,
and I am thinking of giving some of it to my children. What cost
basis will they use if they ever decide to sell?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: When you give stock to your children, you escape the
obligation to pay tax on your capital gain. As you indicate, that
obligation is transferred to the children _ but they don't have to
pay until they sell the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Their cost basis will be the same as yours, and they also will
use your purchase date to determine whether their sale is long term
or short term. (It will be long term if they sell the stock at
least a year and a day after you bought it.)
</P>
<P>
   When you give your children the stock, don't forget to also give
them the transaction slips, brokerage statements or other documents
that confirm the purchase date and price. They will need the
information for their tax records, and they might have to produce
the documents if the Internal Revenue Service poses any questions.
</P>
<P>
   You don't mention the amount of money involved. Bear in mind
that if you plan to give stock with a current value of more than
$10,000 to any one child, you will have to pay a federal gift tax.

FOR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS, ANXIETY AND ASSURANCE AFTER RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SCOTUS-HARASS) 
(mk) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Educational administrators, exhausted by weeks of focus on
school safety and discipline after the shootings in Littleton,
Colo., worried Monday that the Supreme Court's decision on student
sexual harassment would be yet another burden.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, their lawyers pointed to the high legal
standard required by the court for a school to be held liable and
said the ruling should not cause great concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``School administrators are reeling after Littleton,'' said Paul
Houston, executive director of the American Association of School
Administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid they will pick up their papers tomorrow morning
and find that the Supreme Court has handed them one more job, which
is preventing kids from harassing each other,'' Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   But Julie Underwood, general counsel to the National School
Boards Association, said, ``The court stated that school districts
would only be held liable if they were deliberately indifferent to
known and pervasive harassment. These are rare occasions.'' Ms.
Underwood added, ``If the standard had been lower, then we would be
very concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The school boards association had filed a brief urging that the
court not use the lower standard of civil rights law, which makes
institutions liable if they knew or should have known about a
problem, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony Kennedy's concern that the 5-4 ruling would lead
to an avalanche of litigation was unfounded, Ms. Underwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Yurek, general counsel for the National Association of
Secondary School Principals, said the court had reaffirmed what his
organization had been telling its members: that they must be
actively involved in protecting their students and promoting
appropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of boys will be boys and girls will be girls are long
gone,'' Yurek said. ``The school needs to address all elements of
the school environment and teach core values, including respect.
There won't be liability if you are proactive and out there
teaching kids about appropriate behavior. It really is important
that values be taught in schools as well as in homes and
churches.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, the administrators' association director, said he
agreed. But such education would require more teacher training and
there is the potential cost of fighting litigation. He said he was
concerned how the ruling would affect pupils in special education
with emotional or behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Pipho, senior fellow at the Education Commission of the
States, based in Colorado, said some states were already
strengthening education that promotes mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Columbine situation has moved us further along in
the acceptance of the fact that schools have got to do something in
this arena,'' Pipho said.

 Duffield Hands Over Operation of PeopleSoft  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Former Oracle Corp. executive Craig Conway officially took over
yesterday as president and chief operating officer of PeopleSoft
Inc., the once high-flying business software firm that has stumbled
in the past year.
<P>
   Conway, 44, assumes day-to-day management of the Pleasanton firm
from founder and chief executive David Duffield, who said Conway
could succeed him in that position ``in the next six to 12
months.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Conway said his immediate challenge is to steer
PeopleSoft past its current troubles, including a drop in corporate
software orders and a turnover in top leadership, and to refocus on
growth markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One strategic challenge is (to find) the single opportunity
that the company can devote itself to in order to reach the next
level,'' Conway said. ``As the old saying goes, if you go hunting
two rabbits at the same time, then probably both will get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway, 44, moves to PeopleSoft at a time when the second
biggest maker of business management software tries to recover from
a downturn that has caused its revenue growth to plummet from as
high as 80 percent to only 10 percent in the most recent quarter.
In January, the company announced it was laying off about 400
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in PeopleSoft fell from a high of $52.13 in July 1998 to
as low as $11.50 in April. Conway's appointment was announced
before the stock market opened Monday, but PeopleSoft shares rose
only 50 cents, to $16.69.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft and its major competitors, Oracle and SAP AG, have
been hurt by a slump in business software sales in Asia and Latin
America. In addition, the Y2K problem has caused many corporate
technology managers to halt new spending until after the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said PeopleSoft also suffered from the turnover in senior
management, especially when Chief Financial Officer Ronald Codd
resigned in January to head another company and Albert Duffield,
brother of David Duffield, retired as senior vice president of
sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   That left David Duffield at the top, but ``as Dave will tell
you, he's maybe world-class establishing corporate culture, but
he's not the best at managing day-to-day operations,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said he did not have any immediate changes planned
because he wants to take time to inventory the company's strengths
and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   He said that PeopleSoft, which first rocketed to success by
selling human resource management software to the largest Fortune
500 corporations, must now focus on selling business applications
to mid-sized corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Cowan spent eight years at Oracle, where he was executive vice
president for marketing. That included a period in the early 1990s
when Oracle ``stumbled very badly,'' a situation that he said was
comparable to the one PeopleSoft is facing now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a sense we could overcome almost any obstacle by
outselling it,'' Cowan said. ``You almost get lulled into a false
sense of security. PeopleSoft has been able to go so long without
hitting any obstacles. It led a charmed existence. But nobody keeps
60 to 80 percent growth up forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowan was most recently president and CEO of OneTouch Systems
Inc. of San Jose, which was bought by Hughes Network Systems and
the Apollo Group. Before that, he was CEO of TGV Software Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``What attracted me was that (PeopleSoft) was a company with an
incredible franchise in the high-tech industry,'' Conway said.
``Notwithstanding the tactical issues it faces this year, there's a
huge future win here.''
</P>
<P>
   Other moves will probably include acquisitions, perhaps in the
area of software automating sales force management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned, in fact, within the next few weeks,'' Duffield
said. PeopleSoft has already signed partnerships in the past year
with customer relationship management software leader Siebel
Systems Inc. and Vantive Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Duffield, 58, will remain chairman. ``I'll die here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said PeopleSoft must focus more on Internet products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, they have to roll out the most compelling electronic
commerce and Internet-enabled products as fast as they can and
leverage their existing user base effectively and quickly,'' said
Robert Austrian, a software analyst at NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco.

 Revenue Management _ Hotels, airlines, opera houses hope this  tool
will help them maximize sales, profits  By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Opera is the fastest growing performing art in America and the only
one whose audience is getting younger.
<P>
   But it still has a problem. Nationally, 24 percent of seats at
opera performances go unsold, representing at least $70 million in
lost revenue. That's money badly needed by the nation's 113
professional opera companies that rely on ticket sales to cover
half their costs. Wealthy donors pick up the other half.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder, then, that the annual Opera World conference in
Vancouver, B.C., this month was abuzz with talk about a branch of
applied mathematics called ``revenue management'' that promises to
fill empty seats and make performing arts companies more
self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Part art and part science, revenue management relies on complex
formulas to maximize sales and profits by extracting the highest
price possible for a perishable product or service.
</P>
<P>
   It explains why a leisure passenger on an airplane pays $250 for
a cross-country trip, while the business traveler in the next seat
pays $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines pioneered revenue management, and it later was adopted
by hotels, rental car companies and cruise lines. Now, as computers
get cheaper and more powerful, other enterprises as varied as
operas, Internet service providers, natural gas pipelines and golf
courses are looking into it.
</P>
<P>
   Any business that has a fixed capacity and a perishable product
or service is a candidate for revenue management. The key is being
able to determine customers' elasticity of demand _ how badly they
need the product or service and how much they're willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's great interest in this subject,'' said Sam Smith,
marketing director for the industry's biggest trade group, Opera
America. ``If somebody figures out how to adapt this tool to us, it
could revolutionize our business.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; It has already revolutionized the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, deregulation forced carriers to set prices according to
demand, instead of costs.
</P>
<P>
   Using powerful computer systems tied to central reservations
systems, the airline industry learned to forecast demand with
astonishing precision, and continuously change seat prices based on
current sales.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was not just to fill planes, which had been flying
half-empty before deregulation, but to charge the highest fare each
passenger was willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenue management offered us a way to capture revenues that
were being left on the table,'' said Kevin Geraghty, manager of
revenue management for Delta Airlines in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, when revenue management was widely used but not yet
perfected, U.S. airlines filled only 60.4 percent of all available
seats. Last year, the seat occupancy rate hit 70.9 percent. That's
the highest rate for U.S. carriers since the 1940s, and it's even
more remarkable because the industry boosted its seat inventory by
70 percent between 1984 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although airline profits have fluctuated widely, without revenue
management the industry wouldn't have a profit at all, said Garrett
Van Ryzin, a professor in the Graduate School of Business at
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real beneficiary of revenue management has been the
consumer,'' said David Swierenga, chief economist for the Air
Transport Association in Washington, D.C., a trade group. He said
that from 1984 to 1998, the cost of air travel declined by 36
percent, although the savings have not been shared evenly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Designing a capable revenue management tool is a daunting
task. United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, has 140
million seats to sell each year on 780,000 flights.
</P>
<P>
   United recently bought IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer _ the
machine that beat world chess champ Garry Kasparov _ to forecast
demand and adjust prices. It's expected to make more than 10
million fare changes this year in pursuit of higher profits.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Blue cost $20 million ``but we expect it to enhance
revenues by $100 million a year,'' said Bob Merz, director of
domestic pricing for United in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   One way airlines segregate customers is by imposing advance
purchase requirements and Saturday night stays for cheap tickets.
These restrictions act as ``gates'' that separate price-sensitive
leisure travelers from time-sensitive business travelers. The
challenge for other industries is to find the right gates.
</P>
<P>
   A cottage industry of revenue management consultants _ many of
them former airline executives _ is springing up to help companies
do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the potential for it to sweep many industries now,''
said Warren Lieberman, a former American Airlines manager who's now
president of Veritec Solutions in Belmont, a revenue management
consulting firm. ``We're on the cusp of something big.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the industries developing revenue management tools:
</P>
<P>
   _Broadcast networks like ABC and the Canadian Broadcasting
System are using it to price advertising spots.
</P>
<P>
   _Natural gas companies are using it to price their
transportation services so pipelines stay full.
</P>
<P>
   _Restaurants are exploring how they might use it to move
customers to off-peak periods by charging reservation fees and
higher meal prices on Friday and Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   _Internet service providers and fiber-optic networks are looking
at it as a way to better use fixed capacity.
</P>
<P>
   _Golf courses are studying how to use it to better reflect the
value of a tee time on Saturday morning in summer versus a
Wednesday afternoon in winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of an industry that sells something with a fixed
supply and variable demand that couldn't use it,'' said Andy Boyd,
a former Texas A&AMP;M University professor who now works for PROS
Strategic Solutions in Houston, a revenue management consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Even industries that haven't thought about it should, said
Delta's Geraghty. ``Hospitals have hugely expensive pieces of
equipment sitting idle all night. What if they offered MRIs
(magnetic resonance imaging) to uninsured people at cut-rate prices
at night. Wouldn't everyone win?''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Opera currently is debugging a new computer
system, dubbed Silver Stream, that heralds its first serious foray
into revenue management. Using a mainframe computer donated by
Hewlett-Packard Co., it will apply revenue management tools to sell
tickets on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Stream will track all electronic sales and develop
individual customer profiles. Customers who bought tickets over the
Internet for the upcoming ``Der Ring Des Nibelungen,'' for example,
will receive an e-mail solicitation for next year's production of
Wagner's final, five-hour opera, ``Parsifal.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Opera wants to use revenue management to build a
broader audience, tailor marketing to individual tastes and price
tickets to better match demand.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it wants to convert single-ticket buyers into season
ticket holders, said Tom Gulick, director of marketing for San
Francisco Opera. Subscribers are highly desirable because they pay
in advance, helping finance production costs, and they tend to
become donors.
</P>
<P>
   If it builds a big enough database, the Opera board may decide
to charge a wider variety of ticket prices depending on the
performance, the date and the customer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It makes no sense for opera companies to price seats nine
months in advance and have no ability to respond to market forces
like good or bad reviews,'' said David McIntosh, an economist for
Ernst &AMP; Young's Center for Business Innovation in Cambridge, Mass.,
who spoke at the Vancouver opera conference.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue management pushes executives to think about their
businesses in new ways.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Kimes, associate professor of hotel administration at
Cornell University, counsels restaurateurs to give up trying to
raise the size of checks by pushing wine and desserts. That just
makes people sit longer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she says, operators should focus on raising ``revenue
per seat hour,'' a phrase modeled on the airline industry's
benchmark ``revenue per seat mile.''
</P>
<P>
   That means getting parties seated, served and billed faster _
the same way Southwest Airlines focuses on getting planes loaded
and out the gate faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restaurants aren't just selling food,'' said Kimes. ``They're
selling time in a room. Revenue management will help them capture
the value of the total product.''

LIONS LOOK FORWARD TO CARDINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Two days after winning its second consecutive West Coast
Conference baseball championship, Loyola Marymount received
surprising news.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions, who beat Pepperdine for the WCC championship on
Saturday, were rewarded with a trip to Stanford and a first-round
game against the top-seeded Cardinal when the NCAA playoffs start
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   LMU was expecting to stay in Los Angeles and play in the
regional hosted by USC. Head coach Frank Cruz, who guided the Lions
(33-26) to five wins in six games against Pepperdine this season,
was diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going to be at one or the other,'' said Cruz,
whose team upset Stanford last year in a regional opener. ``It's
like, `Pick your poison.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The players were more candid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flat-out beat Pepperdine,'' LMU shortstop Curt Fiore said
on Saturday. ``There were no flukes there.'
</P>
<P>
   Dick Rockwell, the NCAA selection-committee chair, said less
thought was given to LMU's being sent to Stanford and more was
given to Pepperdine's (43-14) receiving the No. 1 seed at USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in the best interest of college baseball if you move
some teams out of (L.A.),'' Rockwell said. ``We think Fullerton is
very good. Pepperdine beat Fullerton twice. I think (the Waves)
deserved a No. 1 seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``About Loyola Marymount, that was probably a more geographic
move than anything else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th-ranked Waves, who were ranked as high as No. 3 earlier
in the season, were seeded first in a regional for the second time
in school history. Rockwell said the Waves deserved to be seeded
over USC, which finished second in the Pac-10 and went 1-1 against
Pepperdine this season.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (30-29) received an at-large bid and plays Oklahoma State
in the regional hosted by Wichita State. Rockwell was asked about
the Bruins' selection on Monday's ESPN telecast of the playoff
pairings and again during a conference call later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That UCLA question probably took up an hour and a half of our
time,'' Rockwell said. ``(The Bruins) played everybody. They played
21 teams in the Top 50. If we were at 48 teams, I don't think UCLA
would have gotten in. (But) they have a reasonable chance to
compete for the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   __ To the rescue: Jason Lane and Barry Zito had All-American
seasons for USC. Eric Munson, the Trojans catcher, is considered
college baseball's top hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Trojans' most valuable player this season is Dominic
Correa, a senior second baseman. Correa, who started only 12 games
as a junior, is batting .343 with 12 home runs and 48 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-11, 185-pound Correa also is a reliable relief
pitcher, going 1-1 with a 2.31 ERA and one save. He talked his way
into a pitching role early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Correa) has been extra valuable,'' USC coach Mike Gillespie
said. ``He's been largely responsible for the success we have had.
It's really a great story.''
</P>
<P>
   USC needed a starting second baseman when Kevin Schultz
unexpectedly quit the team a month before the season. After playing
left field to start the year, Correa became the starter at second
and flourished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I had spot time,'' Correa said. ``I felt I had to do
well to stay in the mix. This is by far the most fun I've had. I
picked a good year to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No experience needed: The highlight of LMU's championship
season was the play of freshman Tommy Perez, who earned the
starting third-base job less than a year after graduating from
Burroughs High.
</P>
<P>
   Perez enters the playoffs batting .294 with 11 homers and 48
RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``My power numbers are decent,'' said Perez, who started 54 of
the Lions' 56 games in the regular season, ``but my average can be
a little higher. I'm happy. I've put together some good numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez wasn't selected in last year's draft until the 45th round.
Despite batting .488 with 12 homers and 48 RBI for the Indians, he
was the 1,332nd player picked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew that scouts had a negative opinion about me,''
Perez said. ``These (LMU) coaches gave me a chance. They didn't
really change much. They let me do what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No `I' in Curt: Curt Fiore wanted to be Loyola Marymount's
starting third baseman this season. Instead, he started at first
base. Then he moved to shortstop in late April when Jack Brooks
went down with a shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Even while moving around the infield, Fiore, a senior, only
committed eight errors. He leads the Lions in batting average
(.366) to go with eight homers and 44 RBI. Fiore's latest homer
came in the seventh inning of LMU's 7-6 win over Pepperdine
Saturday in the decisive third game of the WCC championship series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my last year and I want to do what's right,'' Fiore
said. ``I want to do what is best for the team. If shortstop is the
place to be, that's where I'm going to play.'' &QL; 
PLAYOFF BOUND
</P>
<P>
   Six Los Angeles-area teams earned bids to the 64-team NCAA
college baseball playoffs, which start Friday: &QL; 
__ Pepperdine. Seeded No. 1 at regional hosted by USC. First-game
opponent: Harvard. &QL; 
__ USC: Seeded No. 2. First-game opponent: Virginia Commonwealth. &QL; 
__ UCLA: Seeded No. 3 at Wichita State regional. First-game
opponent: Oklahoma State. &QL; 
__ Loyola Marymount: Seeded No. 4 at Stanford regional. First-game

PREMIUM SEAT SALES AT PATRIOTS STADIUM 50% OFF GOAL 
</HEADLINE>

   BOSTON -- On the day Massachusetts officially anted up $70
million to help the New England Patriots build a new stadium in
Foxborough, business representatives admitted they have fallen
short of their stated goal of selling $15 million in premium
seating, a key source of financing for the project.
</P>
<P>
   As Governor Paul Cellucci signed the stadium bill on Beacon Hill
Monday, Paul G. Kirk Jr., one of the civic leaders who waged the
successful campaign to keep the Patriots from moving to Hartford,
Conn. said: ``I think, at this point, that we have commitments for
about roughly half of that, about $7.5 million worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I'm delighted with where we are,'' Kirk added.
``We've won our fight with the skeptics and this is now reality.
We're just going to continue to go on until the job is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in sports business say the group's initial target
was overly aggressive. They predict that sufficent premium seating
will eventually be sold to get the stadium off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Robert Kraft, in Atlanta for a meeting of National
Football League owners, praised the bill's signing but did not
comment further Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great. That's step one,'' said Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said he would not say more because the NFL owners would
not meet until Tuesday to approve the league's contribution to the
stadium finance package, part of a new policy designed to prevent
teams from deserting big-city markets for smaller cities offering
lucrative stadium deals. However, sources said Kraft also remained
tight-lipped to avoid giving Connecticut any fodder for the lawsuit
it threatened to file after Kraft pulled out of an agreement for a
Hartford facility.
</P>
<P>
   Attending the signing ceremony were Senate President Thomas F.
Birmingham and House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, whose long
opposition to higher levels of state financing had blocked
construction of the stadium here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a happy day for all of the taxpayers in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, whether they're sports fans or not,'' said
Birmingham, who raised both arms in a touchdown signal when he
walked to a podium to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when Kirk and other civic leaders put the issue of
the Patriots stadium back on the agenda in Massachusetts, they said
they would follow through with a campaign to obtain commitments
from corporations to purchase a big portion of the 100 to 120
luxury suites and about 6,000 club seats planned for the facility.
</P>
<P>
   The civic leaders said the ticket drive was part of the business
community's commitment to the stadium, a private-sector complement
to the state's agreement to fund $70 million in improvements to
roads, sewers, and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Civic leaders said they wanted to have the commitments lined up
to present to the NFL owners at this week's meeting. At the time,
it was possible that both the Connecticut and Massachusetts stadium
offers could be on the table for the owners to review.
</P>
<P>
   But Kraft, citing concern that the Hartford stadium could not be
ready by 2002 as promised, pulled out of the deal at the end of
April. That took some of the pressure off the Bay State drive to
line up seating commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft briefed the NFL owners' finance committee Monday. Owners
are expected to approve a plan Tuesday, even with the seating
commitments running behind target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the lesson is that one needs to be careful saying
publicly how high the bar is raised,'' said Larry Moulter,
president of Woolf Associates. ``These are expensive properties,
and the companies don't make their decisions that quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will sell, across time,'' Moulter said, adding
that if the stock market remains at the 11,000 level until the
stadium is built, it will make for an easier sale to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Caporale, of the investment banking firm Game Plan LLC,
said that obtaining $7.5 million in commitments in less than a
month is actually a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought from the start that their goal was overly
ambitious,'' Caporale said. ``If they've achieved that number in
that short a period of time, I think they've done well.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both the Boston Red Sox and the FleetCenter, which
both have premium seating, have said that the Boston market will
probably sustain new stadiums for the Red Sox and the Patriots, as
well as re-selling the seating at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Competition with Red Sox management, which signaled its
impending approach to the premium-seating market when announcing
plans for a new Fenway Park 10 days ago, has not played a major
role in slowing businesses' commitments to the Patriots, Kirk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard an isolated story here and there, that one company
is holding back while they weigh the Red Sox situation, too,'' said
Kirk. ``But, overall, no, I don't think it has been a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, trailer park residents on the Foxboro Stadium site,
who under terms of the $70 million stadium bill have six months to
vacate, said Monday that they are soliciting support from
Foxborough officials and voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorry we're in the way,'' said Jackie Sewell, who lives
in a mobile home on land owned by Kraft. ``We want to be moved to
another location. We don't want to stop progress for our state. We
just want Mr. Kraft to move us to another location.''
</P>
<P>
   The residents have formed the Route One Mobile Home Tenants
Association to fight any plan that would move them off the site.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kraus, a Plymouth attorney hired by the residents, has
formally notified Kraft's real estate company that the tenants will
wage a legal fight to stay somewhere on the stadium site.

ANALYSIS: WITH VOLPE PLEADING GUILTY, NEW PROBLEMS FOR REMAINING
DEFENDANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They acted as if he were not even in the same
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   They did not say good morning to him, they did not pat him on
the back, they barely looked at him at all.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, four officers who grudgingly shared a defense table
with Officer Justin A. Volpe worked hard to convey to jurors a
simple message: He is not one of us.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Volpe's sudden decision to admit he rammed a stick
into Abner Louima's rectum, their wish will come true: Volpe will
vanish from the defense table, left to await his sentence while
under house arrest at his parents' home in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   For the remaining officers on trial, the effect of Volpe's
guilty plea creates several new questions for their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors almost surely will not be told of Volpe's pleading
guilty to violating Louima's civil rights in a sexual assault.
Because of fears of prejudicing the jury, the judge will likely
point out Volpe's absence but instruct the jurors to draw no
inference from it. But will jurors _ who are not sequestered _
learn about the guilty plea anyway? And if they do, will it taint
their views of the remaining officers?
</P>
<P>
   Volpe is not expected to testify for the prosecution, because he
has not made a deal with prosecutors, who have indicated they do
not consider him a reliable witness. But will his absence focus the
jury's attention on the conduct of the other four who up until now
have largely escaped notice?
</P>
<P>
   Judge Eugene Nickerson of U.S. District Court has instructed
jurors not to hold the remaining four accountable for the actions
described in some of the most damaging testimony to date, but will
federal prosecutors, freed of the need to build a case against
their most prominent defendant, now bear down on them?
</P>
<P>
   The complications were immediately apparent Monday, moments
after Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, asked for a private
conference with Nickerson to announce his client's intent to plead
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen C. Worth, a lawyer for Officer Charles Schwarz, asked
the judge to withhold from the public any mention of Volpe's change
of heart until he entered his plea in open court.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it will be what took place in court,'' Worth said,
``and not the wild, wild and crazy speculation that's going to go
on now because of the press' misunderstanding of what's happening
here, which is that he simply, as I understand it, is entering a
plea of guilty on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   But moment later, after consulting with ``my
soon-to-be-remaining co-counsel,'' Worth suddenly reversed course
and withdrew his request that Nickerson keep secret Volpe's plans
to change his plea
</P>
<P>
   Of all the defense lawyers still in the case, Worth may have the
most to be concerned about. Only his client faces charges in
connection with the sodomy of Louima in the bathroom at the 70th
Precinct. Schwarz is accused of holding Louima down.
</P>
<P>
   Two other officers, Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder, are accused
of beating Louima in a police car. The fourth, Sgt. Michael
Bellomo, is charged with covering up the assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for all four have repeatedly asked Nickerson to sever
their cases from Volpe's trial on grounds that evidence against him
would automatically prejudice jurors against all the officers.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, most of the evidence presented so far has focused on
Volpe. He is the only officer Louima has been able to identify as
being involved in the attack. He has been the trial's central
character, a muscular, 27-year-old who sat at the defense table,
silent but often glowering, as day by day, witness by witness, the
evidence piled up around him, like shovels of sand on a coffin.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, it was a trauma surgeon who did the shoveling,
telling jurors how lacerations on Louima's rectum and bladder lined
up perfectly with one another, making his injuries consistent with
trauma from a blunt object.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe slumped deeper in his chair, scribbled a few more notes on
his legal pad, and watched himself be buried by an efficient team
of federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, Kornberg acknowledged what was becoming
increasingly obvious to those who lined up each morning to get a
courtroom seat at U.S. District Court in Brooklyn: That the
allegations against his client are true, that Volpe's denials have
been lies, that Louima, handcuffed and bloodied and face down on
the urine-splattered floor of a police bathroom, suffered through
one of the worst instances of police brutality on record.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Kornberg's announcement that his client intends to
plead guilty came primarily because four more of Volpe's colleagues
in the 70th Precinct shattered the legendary wall of silence that
traditionally serves and protects police officers who do wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which the wall crumbled surprised even Kornberg _
one of New York City's top trial lawyers _ to such a degree that he
abandoned his intention to cross-examine two of the officers who
testified against his client.
</P>
<P>
   One officer described how Volpe casually brandished a
foul-smelling stick even as Louima lay in agony on the floor of a
holding cell, blood trickling into his abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Another described how he boasted of breaking a man down.
</P>
<P>
   Another described how his uniform was disheveled, how Volpe's
name tag had been removed from his shirt, and how his mood seemed
oddly muted and detached that August morning.
</P>
<P>
   Another described how Volpe borrowed a pair of gloves and
returned them covered in blood like it was no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony was so strong that Volpe surely seemed headed for
conviction, and if found guilty by a jury, would face life in
prison. By admitting guilt, he may receive a lesser sentence from
the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the trial, Louima took the stand and quietly gave his
account of what happened the night he was arrested outside Club
Rendezvous in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony was restrained and dignified, but Kornberg and the
defense lawyers for the four other police officers on trial tried
to savage Louima's credibility. They jumped at every opportunity to
mention his $150-million lawsuit against the city. They forced him
to confess to all the lies he told about that night, starting with
his whopper about how his attackers boasted ``It's Giuliani time.''
</P>
<P>
   The cross-examination raised doubts about Louima's account --
until Volpe's brethren began their joyless parade to the witness
chair.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Kornberg attacked them with the same vigor he attacked
Louima. He went so far as to suggest during a sidebar conference
with Nickerson that the first officer to testify, Detective Eric
Turetzky, was doing so because he once had a crush on Volpe's
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   But when the third officer marched to the stand, the fight was
starting to ebb from Kornberg. His initial line of defense _ that
Louima's injuries were caused by consensual gay sex _ was in a
shambles, and not only because prosecutors pointed out that Louima
is married, has two children and a third on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The medical testimony Monday cast strong doubt on Kornberg's gay
sex theory, as did descriptions of a healthy, dancing, club-bopping
Louima, seen shaking hours later with the onset of shock.
</P>
<P>
   And so, when the third officer, Sgt. Kenneth Wernick, finished
his story of Volpe walking stick in hand toward a dumpster,
Kornberg clearly signaled the coming white flag by saying he had no
questions. In case anyone missed the signal, he did it again when
prosecutors were finished with the fourth officer. ``No
questions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters he was changing tactics, and he dangled hints
of some grand master plan to rescue Volpe. But the only plan, it
now turns out, is for Volpe to throw himself on the mercy of
Nickerson.

COMMENTARY: AMERICAN-STYLE CAPITALISM WINS ONE IN ITALY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle for Telecom Italia has ended with the victory of an
American-style leveraged buyout over a more genteel international
merger of two former state monopolies. But it is far from clear
that Olivetti, the victor, can successfully operate the Italian
phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti prevailed despite opposition from the management of
Telecom Italia, which wanted to merge instead with Deutsche
Telekom, the former telephone monopoly in Germany that is still
mostly owned by the German government. There were good reasons for
rejecting that deal, most notably that the managements seemed to
have no coherent strategy for operating the merged company, but
there were also elements of economic nationalism as Italians
rejected a German merger.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that in the end this whole battle, and what comes
after it, will whet European appetites for capitalism
American-style, in which shareholder interests are dominant and
convoluted financial arrangements are used to take control of
companies. But it is also possible that it will end up with most
affected Italians _ whether customers, employees or shareholders in
Telecom Italia _ feeling abused and angry, thereby creating a
backlash.
</P>
<P>
   The big losers so far have been Italian investors, most of them
individuals, who own a class of Telecom Italia's shares known as
``savings shares.'' Those shares are entitled to higher dividends
than normal shares. But the savings shares don't vote, and have
been virtually ignored in this battle. Their price has fallen amid
fears that Olivetti will end up slashing the dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, normal shares of Telecom Italia rose during the
battle, but fell back Monday, and for good reason. The most likely
thing that will happen now is that those shareholders will be
forced to trade their shares for shares in Tecnost, the Olivetti
subsidiary that now controls Telecom Italia. Olivetti needs to do
that to give it access to Telecom Italia's cash flow, which it will
use to pay interest on the billions of dollars it has borrowed to
swing the deal. Once that happens, those shareholders may see their
dividends cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecom Italia shareholders in that position are largely
individuals who bought the company as a safe investment. Many of
them sat on the sidelines while institutions, which understood what
was going on, sold their shares to Olivetti in its tender offer and
thus got out while the getting was good.
</P>
<P>
   Share ownership for individuals is not well ingrained in Europe.
If this does not work out for the shareholders, it could have
repercussions in popular attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   If Olivetti can simply keep Telecom Italia's profits from
continuing to fall, things will be fine. The debt is not
overwhelming relative to the company's historical profits. But
those profits have dropped as competitors picked off customers.
</P>
<P>
   To stop such thefts, Telecom Italia will need to make large
investments in its operations while changing the attitudes of a
work force that is used to having a monopoly and that, under a
succession of chief executives since it was privatized, does not
appear to have adapted very well.
</P>
<P>
   The size of that work force was already slated to decline, and
now will fall much more rapidly. If the government resists layoffs,
that would hurt Olivetti.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Colaninno, Olivetti's chief executive, may go down in
European history as the man who used American-style takeover
tactics to gain control of a company that he then improved to
everyone's benefit. But if things do not work out, there is likely
to be a backlash against the aggressive tactics of such takeovers.

EDITORIAL: PATAKI'S PUBLIC SAFETY FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, May 25:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki portrays himself as a law-and-order
politician who makes public safety a top priority. The governor is
very vocal about his desire to keep even nonviolent prisoners in
jail for longer periods of time. But meanwhile, on his watch,
mentally ill people with histories of violent behavior are being
sent to live in the community without adequate supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Goldstein, who is charged with pushing 32-year-old Kendra
Webdale to her death in front of a subway last January, was a
textbook example of how New York state's policies can threaten not
only the former patients left to fend for themselves, but also the
public at large. As reported by Michael Winerip in The New York
Times Magazine on Sunday, Goldstein had attacked at least 13 other
people in the previous two years and had compiled a 3,500-page
psychiatric file that indicated ``high risk for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein kept asking to be hospitalized. But the system, which
is fixated on getting people out of institutions in the cheapest
way possible, kept spitting him back out onto the streets. He wound
up in a rooming house, and when he stopped taking his medication
and going to his assigned mental health clinic, he was sent a form
letter warning that his case was going to be closed. Shortly
thereafter, he wound up in the subway station where he is accused
of pushing Ms. Webdale to her death.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki administration officials are not allowed to talk about
patients' case histories, but they note that New York spends more
than $4 billion a year on mental health services. Nevertheless,
there are about 5,000 fewer beds in state psychiatric hospitals now
than when Pataki took office, and only a few hundred additional
community slots that provide both shelter and round-the-clock
supervision. Even though all former mental patients do not need
that kind of expensive care, the numbers suggest that there is a
large gap.
</P>
<P>
   The state is now down to its last 6,000 mental hospital
patients, many of whom have criminal records, histories of violence
or long periods of institutionalization. Pataki should halt further
bed reductions until he can assure the state that the people being
sent back to their communities will get the supervision they need.
He should also expand the disappointingly puny program he proposed
to provide new housing for the chronic mentally ill in New York
City, and demonstrate concern for patients who leave the rapidly
shrinking state psychiatric hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, many of them wind up in subsidized beds in glorified
flophouses, with no one to check to make sure that they take their
medication and go to their appointments with a therapist. The
results are an increase in the number of delusional homeless people
on the streets and in the shelters _ and a tragedy like the one
that befell Ms. Webdale.

3 VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS TAKE STAKE IN DATEK ONLINE HOLDINGS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three prominent venture capital firms, including one financed by
Paul G. Allen, a co-founder of the Microsoft Corp., have agreed to
jointly purchase a minority stake in the Datek Online Holdings
Corp. for a total of $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Datek owns the nation's fourth-largest online brokerage service
and is the parent of Island ECN, a computer-based stock-trading
system that is seeking regulatory approval to operate as the
nation's newest stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The investment, to be formally announced Tuesday, is to be made
by Vulcan Ventures, Allen's venture capital organization in
Bellevue, Wash.; TA Associates, a Boston-based venture fund whose
investors include major university endowments and corporate pension
funds, and Group Arnault of Paris, the private holding company run
by the French businessman Bernard Arnault. Group Arnault, which has
recently become active as an investor in online commerce, controls
LVMH Moeet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury-goods merchandiser.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston, calls for
Group Arnault to contribute $170 million, with TA Associates
investing $75 million and Vulcan contributing $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Datek nor the venture capital firms would disclose the
exact size of the minority stake being purchased. But Kenneth T.
Schiciano, a principal with TA Associates, said the funds'
investment ``values the company in excess of $1 billion,'' which
suggests that less than a third of Datek's equity is changing
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Nicoll, president of Datek Online Holdings, said that
the company's six-member board of directors would be expanded to
nine members to accommodate representatives from each of the three
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The money will help finance an expanded marketing program,
improved computer technology and recruitment of new personnel,
Nicoll said. ``This is a transformative event for our firm,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Datek's online brokerage service was fined and
sanctioned by Federal regulators for using as much as $50 million
from customer accounts to settle other customers' trades and to pay
company bills. The company said it had improved its financial
controls since the incidents cited by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Island ECN has applied for regulatory permission to
operate as a stock exchange, an expensive undertaking that will
require it to develop some way of policing its own operations and
members.

   NEW YORK _ King Abdullah of Jordan, ending his first visit to
America since ascending the throne, said Monday he believed Syria
was ready to make peace with Israel and that once Israel's new
government was installed, there would be ``quick movement'' toward
peace.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the key to a stable, peaceful and prosperous
Middle East remained in reinforcing peace between Israel and its
Palestinian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have peace with Syria at the expense of Israelis and
Palestinians without having their problems solved will only create
more of a difficulty,'' the king warned.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old king discussed the need for peace and economic
development in the region and at home in Jordan in a meeting with
the editorial board of The New York Times. He spoke on his second
day of a visit to New York and the final day of his 10-day trip to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was was ``very happy'' with the election results in
Israel, in which the Labor Party leader, Ehud Barak, scored an
impressive victory, the king said that the contest was not just an
election of an individual, but a referendum on whether Israel
should continue the peace process. ``This is a new beginning,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Syrian leader, Hafez al-Assad, had resisted many
previous peace overtures from Israel, the atmosphere in Damascus
had changed, Abdullah asserted. ``I think Syria realizes that it's
missed the boat on several occasions and now here's an opportunity
to start again,'' the king said. ``And I don't think that another
opportunity will come up again.''
</P>
<P>
   During his recent visit to Damascus, he said, Syria was
``particularly forthcoming'' in its desire to move forward with
Israel, as were other Arab states. ``The Arab world wants peace
with Israel,'' Abdullah declared.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked whether Barak would give back to Syria the
Golan Heights, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 war, the
king said he usually replied to that question with a question:
``Isn't it better to give up the Golan and conquer the rest of the
Arab world? You give up on one side but there is so much to gain on
the other.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he added, while it was easy to seek a ``quick
fix, or a quick reward'' by concentrating on Syria at the expense
of the Israeli-Palestinian issue, focus had to be maintained on
resolving the ``original'' conflict, he said. ``You can very easily
be blinded by the prize that a Syria-Israeli peace might afford and
forget about the original problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an impassioned appeal shortly before he headed back to his
capital, Amman, the king also urged the United States and its NATO
allies to stay the course in Kosovo and insure that the refugees
can return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are doing this not just for Kosovo; you're doing this for
the world,'' said the king, who has spent the last 10 days seeking
economic help for his country and political support in Washington
and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Much depends on how the Balkans conflict is resolved, he said.
On Monday and earlier in his visit, he said that how the conflict
in Kosovo ended would be an indicator of American resolve
throughout the world and would ``set the rules'' for other
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming king in February after the death of his father,
King Hussein, who had been admired in Washington, Abdullah has
tried to ease tensions with countries with which Jordan has had
occasionally tense relations, including Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, Abdullah said, had ``time on
his side'' and was ``breaking down barriers'' and creating a
``sense of hope for the moderates.'' But, he added, toning down
some of his earlier optimism about his turbulent region, moderating
Iran ``might take a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The young king, who was raised largely in England and who was
partly schooled in the United States, comfortably fielded often
skeptical questions at meetings Monday and Tuesday with Jewish
organizations, policy groups and the news media. Reiterating his
view that economic development was key to a politically stable,
peaceful region, he vowed that Jordan would reform and liberalize
its economy to attract foreign and domestic investment within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to have succeeded in winning many American hearts and
minds, and was hopeful that he had made some progress in securing
the debt relief which he said Jordan desperately needed. ``This is
our one big chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a dinner on Sunday night, former Secretary of State Henry
A. Kissinger, who spent years mediating peace agreements between
Arabs and Israelis, said he was ``very favorably impressed'' by
Abdullah, who he said exhibited ``a certain strategic sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Salberg, the chairman of the Conference of Presidents of
Major American Jewish Organizations, with whom the king met Monday
morning, said King Abdullah was a ``very open, direct person who
I'm certain will advance peace.'' And, Salberg added, ``I believe
he's tough enough.''

VICTIM'S KIN TO SUE HOSPITALS OVER MAN'S RELEASE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The family of Kendra Webdale, the Manhattan woman
pushed to her death in front of a subway train, will file a lawsuit
against the hospitals that discharged the mentally ill man charged
with killing her, the family's lawyer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That announcement was one of several developments after an
article in The New York Times Magazine on Sunday detailed how the
state's mental health system had failed Andrew Goldstein, 29, the
schizophrenic man who is accused of shoving Ms. Webdale in front of
an oncoming train last January.
</P>
<P>
   The case has already served as a rallying point for advocates
and legislators trying to increase supervised housing for the
chronically mentally ill and to pass an outpatient commitment law
to make it easier to compel mentally ill people to undergo
treatment, and in some cases to commit them to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine article, which drew on 3,500 pages of
Goldstein's confidential psychiatric records to demonstrate how
state mental health policies had led to his rejection from care,
spurred a new rush to announce mental health legislation.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman James F. Brennan, a Brooklyn Democrat who is
chairman of the Assembly's Mental Health Committee, said Monday he
will introduce a bill within days to authorize a $200 million
appropriation for 2,500 additional beds for the chronically
mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas W. Libous, a Binghamton Republican and chairman of the
State Senate's committee on mental health, Monday introduced a bill
that would use $5 million to provide and coordinate services to a
small group of particularly troubled former patients who are
mentally ill. His bill is an alternative to the proposed outpatient
commitment measure that has been dubbed ``Kendra's Law.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine article described how, in the two years before Ms.
Webdale's death, Goldstein attacked at least 13 other people,
including some of the hospital staff members who kept discharging
him to live on his own unsupervised. When hospital social workers
tried to send him to long-term care or supervised housing, or to
assign him to a case manager to monitor him, they found long
waiting lists because of severe cutbacks by the administration of
Gov. George E. Pataki in state-financed mental health services, the
article reported.
</P>
<P>
   And though the case has inspired legislation to make involuntary
commitment easier, the article pointed out that Goldstein himself
voluntarily signed up for all 13 of his hospitalizations, and
repeatedly sought commitment or supervised living in the months
before he is said to have pushed a stranger onto the N train tracks
at 23d Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Jay W. Dankner, one of the Webdales' lawyers, said that the
family had already been planning a lawsuit, but that the article
provided information that they had been unable to obtain, including
details on some of the institutions that had dealt with Goldstein.
The lawsuit will be filed against at least eight hospitals and
clinics involved in Goldstein's care, he said, and will seek $50
million in punitive damages and $10 million for pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's last hospitalization before he attacked Ms. Webdale
was at North General Hospital in Harlem, from Nov. 24 to Dec. 15.
Because of cost-saving measures mandated under managed care,
hospitals that operate short-term, or ``acute care,'' psychiatric
units are under great financial pressure to discharge patients
within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and James L. Stone, the commissioner of the State Office
of Mental Health, did not return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webdale's sister, Kim, said she felt sick as she read the
article describing the systemic collapse that led up to her
sister's death, and that her mother cried so hard over it, she was
shaking. ``I hope it will elicit some change,'' she said.

EXCERPTS FROM SUPREME COURT DECISION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With SCOTUS-HARASS, SCOTUS-HARASS-IMPACT) 
(mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's
decision Monday holding school districts liable for damages if they
fail to stop a student from the severe and pervasive sexual
harassment of another student. The vote in Davis vs. Monroe County
Board of Education was 5-4. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the
majority opinion, and Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By O'Connor
</P>
<P>
   We consider here whether a private damages action may lie
against the school board in cases of student-on-student harassment.
We conclude that it may, but only where the funding recipient acts
with deliberate indifference to known acts of harassment in its
programs or activities. Moreover, we conclude that such an action
will lie only for harassment that is so severe, pervasive, and
objectively offensive that it effectively bars the victim's access
to an educational opportunity or benefit. ...
</P>
<P>
   Petitioner's minor daughter, LaShonda, was allegedly the victim
of a prolonged pattern of sexual harassment by one of her
fifth-grade classmates at Hubbard Elementary School, a public
school in Monroe County, Ga. ...
</P>
<P>
   The string of incidents finally ended in mid-May, when G.F. was
charged with, and pleaded guilty to, sexual battery for his
misconduct. The complaint alleges that LaShonda had suffered during
the months of harassment, however; specifically, her previously
high grades allegedly dropped as she became unable to concentrate
on her studies, and, in April 1993, her father discovered that she
had written a suicide note. ...
</P>
<P>
   Petitioner alleges that no disciplinary action was taken in
response to G.F.'s behavior toward LaShonda. ...
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, 1994, petitioner filed suit in the United States
District Court for the Middle District of Georgia against the
board, Charles Dumas, the school district's superintendent, and
Principal Querry. The complaint alleged that the board is a
recipient of federal funding for purposes of Title IX, that ``the
persistent sexual advances and harassment by the student G.F. upon
(LaShonda) interfered with her ability to attend school and perform
her studies and activities,'' and that ``the deliberate
indifference by defendants to the unwelcome sexual advances of a
student upon LaShonda created an intimidating, hostile, offensive
and abus(ive) school environment in violation of Title IX.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Title IX provides, with certain exceptions not at issue here,
that ``no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex,
be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of or be
subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity
receiving federal financial assistance.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   We disagree with respondents' assertion, however, that
petitioner seeks to hold the board liable for G.F.'s actions
instead of its own. Here, petitioner attempts to hold the board
liable for its own decision to remain idle in the face of known
student-on-student harassment in its schools. In Gebser, we
concluded that a recipient of federal education funds may be liable
in damages under Title IX where it is deliberately indifferent to
known acts of sexual harassment by a teacher. In that case, a
teacher had entered into a sexual relationship with an eighth-grade
student, and the student sought damages under Title IX for the
teacher's misconduct. ...
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, we rejected the use of agency principles to impute
liability to the district for the misconduct of its teachers.
Likewise, we declined the invitation to impose liability under what
amounted to a negligence standard holding the district liable for
its failure to react to teacher-student harassment of which it knew
or should have known. Rather, we concluded that the district could
be liable for damages only where the district itself intentionally
acted in clear violation of Title IX by remaining deliberately
indifferent to acts of teacher-student harassment of which it had
actual knowledge. ...
</P>
<P>
   We stress that our conclusion here that recipients may be liable
for their deliberate indifference to known acts of peer sexual
harassment does not mean that recipients can avoid liability only
by purging their schools of actionable peer harassment or that
administrators must engage in particular disciplinary action. We
thus disagree with respondents' contention that, if Title IX
provides a cause of action for student-on-student harassment,
``nothing short of expulsion of every student accused of misconduct
involving sexual overtones would protect school systems from
liability or damages.'' Likewise, the dissent erroneously imagines
that victims of peer harassment now have a Title IX right to make
particular remedial demands. In fact, as we have previously noted,
courts should refrain from second guessing the disciplinary
decisions made by school administrators. ...
</P>
<P>
   While it remains to be seen whether petitioner can show that the
board's response to reports of G.F.'s misconduct was clearly
unreasonable in light of the known circumstances, petitioner may be
able to show that the board ``subject(ed)'' LaShonda to
discrimination by failing to respond in any way over a period of
five months to complaints of G.F.'s in-school misconduct from
LaShonda and other female students. ...
</P>
<P>
   The statute makes clear that, whatever else it prohibits,
students must not be denied access to educational benefits and
opportunities on the basis of gender. We thus conclude that funding
recipients are properly held liable in damages only where they are
deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment, of which they have
actual knowledge, that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively
offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of access to
the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.
...
</P>
<P>
   Damages are not available for simple acts of teasing and
name-calling among school children, however, even where these
comments target differences in gender. Rather, in the context of
student-on-student harassment, damages are available only where the
behavior is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it
denies its victims the equal access to education that Title IX is
designed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   The dissent fails to appreciate these very real limitations on a
funding recipient's liability under Title IX. It is not enough to
show, as the dissent would read this opinion to provide, that a
student has been ``teased,'' or ``called ... offensive names.'' ...
Nor do we contemplate, much less hold, that a mere ``decline in
grades is enough to survive'' a motion to dismiss. The drop-off in
LaShonda's grades provides necessary evidence of a potential link
between her education and G.F.'s misconduct, but petitioner's
ability to state a cognizable claim here depends equally on the
alleged persistence and severity of G.F.'s actions, not to mention
the board's alleged knowledge and deliberate indifference. We trust
that the dissent's characterization of our opinion will not mislead
courts to impose more sweeping liability than we read Title IX to
require. ...
</P>
<P>
   Although, in theory, a single instance of sufficiently severe
one-on-one peer harassment could be said to have such an effect, we
think it unlikely that Congress would have thought such behavior
sufficient to rise to this level in light of the inevitability of
student misconduct and the amount of litigation that would be
invited by entertaining claims of official indifference to a single
instance of one-on-one peer harassment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Kennedy
</P>
<P>
   Title IX provides: ``No person in the United States shall, on
the basis of sex be (1) excluded from participation in, (2) be
denied the benefits of, or (3) be subjected to discrimination under
any education program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   To read the provision in full is to understand what is most
striking about its application in this case: Title IX does not by
its terms create any private cause of action whatsoever, much less
define the circumstances in which money damages are available. The
only private cause of action under Title IX is judicially implied.
</P>
<P>
   The remedial scheme the majority creates today is neither
sensible nor faithful to Spending Clause principles. In order to
make its case for school liability for peer sexual harassment, the
majority must establish that Congress gave grant recipients clear
and unambiguous notice that they would be liable in money damages
for failure to remedy discriminatory acts of their students. The
majority must also demonstrate that the statute gives schools clear
notice that one child's harassment of another constitutes
``discrimination'' on the basis of sex within the meaning of Title
IX, and that _ as applied to individual cases _ the standard for
liability will enable the grant recipient to distinguish
inappropriate childish behavior from actionable gender
discrimination. The majority does not carry these burdens. ...
</P>
<P>
   The only certainty flowing from the majority's decision is that
scarce resources will be diverted from educating our children and
that many school districts, desperate to avoid Title IX peer
harassment suits, will adopt whatever federal code of student
conduct and discipline the Department of Education sees fit to
impose upon them. ...
</P>
<P>
   When Title IX was enacted in 1972, the concept of ``sexual
harassment'' as gender discrimination had not been recognized or
considered by the courts. See generally C. MacKinnon, Sexual
Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination 59-72
(1979). The types of discrimination that were recognized _
discriminatory admissions standards, denial of access to programs
or resources, hiring, etc. _ could not be engaged in by students.
</P>
<P>
   The majority nonetheless appears to see no need to justify
drawing the ``enough control'' line to encompass students. In
truth, however, a school's control over its students is much more
complicated and limited than the majority acknowledges. A public
school does not control its students in the way it controls its
teachers or those with whom it contracts. ...
</P>
<P>
   The real world of school discipline is a rough-and-tumble place
where students practice newly learned vulgarities, erupt with
anger, tease and embarrass each other, share offensive notes,
flirt, push and shove in the halls, grab and offend. ...
</P>
<P>
   It is a far different question, however, whether it is either
proper or useful to label this immature, childish behavior gender
discrimination. Nothing in Title IX suggests that Congress even
contemplated this question, much less answered it in the
affirmative in unambiguous terms. ...
</P>
<P>
   The majority's limitations on peer sexual harassment suits
cannot hope to contain the flood of liability the court today
begins. The elements of the Title IX claim created by the majority
will be easy not only to allege but also to prove. A female
plaintiff who pleads only that a boy called her offensive names,
that she told a teacher, that the teacher's response was
unreasonable, and that her school performance suffered as a result,
appears to state a successful claim. ...
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, this case is about federalism. Yet the
majority's decision today says not one word about the federal
balance. Preserving our federal system is a legitimate end in
itself. It is, too, the means to other ends. It insures that
essential choices can be made by a government more proximate to the
people than the vast apparatus of federal power. Defining the
appropriate role of schools in teaching and supervising children
who are beginning to explore their own sexuality and learning how
to express it to others is one of the most complex and sensitive
issues our schools face. Such decisions are best made by parents
and by the teachers and school administrators who can counsel with
them. ...
</P>
<P>
   Heedless of these considerations, the court rushes onward,
finding that the cause of action it creates is necessary to effect
the congressional design. It is not. Nothing in Title IX suggests
that Congress intended or contemplated the result the court reaches
today, much less dictated it in unambiguous terms. Today's decision
cannot be laid at the feet of Congress; it is the responsibility of
the court. ...

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George Pataki on Monday became the 16th
Republican governor to endorse the candidacy of Gov. George W.
Bush, the Texas Republican who is viewed by many party leaders as
the front-runner for the presidential nomination. With his
announcement, Pataki effectively abandoned his own flirtation with
running in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki made his endorsement at an elaborately staged rally at a
midtown Manhattan ballroom, surrounded by Republican leaders who
had traveled from across the state to join the governor for what
had been advertised as a major political announcement. For all the
mystery Pataki had attached to the event, it came as something less
than a surprise, given Bush's already broad support among national
Republicans, and seemed unlikely to significantly alter the state
of play on the presidential field.
</P>
<P>
   Bush listened by a satellite hookup from Austin, Texas, as
Pataki described Bush as the leader in a class of Republican
governors who had pursued the party's policies of reducing
government regulation, taxes and welfare rolls. In effect, Pataki
applied to Bush the same rationale he had offered for himself in
raising his own national profile earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an inclusive Republican who has reached out with his
doctrine of compassionate conservatism and in the process built a
party that has supported him with overwhelming votes from the
Hispanic community, from women, from African-Americans across
Texas,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers was
organized as a political show of force, intended to portray Pataki
to Bush as a powerful force in New York politics. Pataki has left
little doubt that he would like to be considered as a vice
presidential candidate by Bush, though he declined to address the
question directly on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's advisers did their best to stimulate interest in the
event. Blue spotlights formed a glowing backdrop for Pataki as he
spoke; Bush's face was beamed onto a huge video screen. Guards
barred reporters who arrived late, apparently out of concern that
they might distract from the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the absence of true drama in the event was evident the
moment Pataki took the stage, notwithstanding the 23 video cameras
that recorded the event. As the governor began to talk, state Sen.
Roy Goodman, R-Manhattan, flipped open his cell phone and began a
whispered conversation from his perch near Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the turnout, the absence of one major Republican
_ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City, who has signaled that he
is likely to endorse Bush as well _ was evidence of the divisions
that remain between the governor and Giuliani. By contrast, U.S.
Rep. Rick Lazio, R-Long Island, who has said he will challenge
Giuliani if he seeks his party's Senate nomination next year, was
afforded a prominent spot on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was not concerned that he had not been invited.
``I think the focus was on trying to get as much attention for the
presidential race as possible. And it obviously wasn't about a
possible Senate race or anything else, so I have no problem with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki ignored questions shouted by reporters about whether
Giuliani had been invited. His political adviser, Zenia Mucha,
responded to the same question by saying: ``Who? Pardon me? I can't
hear you.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I received a severance package which was
paid out over 10 months. Right now my resume shows that I left the
company when I stopped working there. Would it be unethical for me
to change the dates to show the service to the company ending when
my severance elapsed, i.e. 10 months later? M.C.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Do you really want to be in a situation where a job
interviewer asks you about your job responsibilities at the company
during the past year, and you are forced to respond with, ``Uh,
well, I wasn't exactly working there.'' To which the interviewer
will instantly think, ``And you won't exactly be working here
either.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that when your service to the company ended, it
ended. There is nothing negative about that and there is nothing to
hide. By changing the dates on your resume, you are providing
misleading information to a potential employer. This cannot only
prevent your being employed, but it can be grounds for termination
if you are hired and this fact is discovered later.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than misrepresenting the 10 months, let the employer know
what you have been doing in this period. If you have been taking
some time off, that is not a problem. In fact, some employers
interpret that positively. You were able to step back, relax, clear
your head and now you are ready to work. Obviously, if you have
taken any steps to upgrade your skills, such as through classes,
readings or seminars, that is important to mention.
</P>
<P>
   The employer may have a number of questions about what you were
doing, but at least there will be no question about your ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our company has a lot of angry employees. It's not a violent
thing, but they just seem to be upset and negative. We have talked
with them about this, but they don't say much. What can you
suggest? L.L.
</P>
<P>
   A: When employees are upset, management becomes upset, which
causes employees to become more upset, which causes management to
become more upset. Fortunately, there are ways to stop this
freewheeling cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Your first step was the correct one. When the employees appear
to be angry and negative, it makes sense to meet with them and
attempt to clear the air. However, since you feel like you are
still in the fog when it comes to understanding the negativity, a
related step is to meet with the employees whom you consider to be
the opinion leaders. They may not have formal titles or leadership
positions, but they understand and often shape many of their
co-workers' views.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is important to note that a number of
studies have been finding increased levels of employee anger at
work. There is a wide range of causes, but one of the most common
is a gap between employee expectations and employee experiences.
This means that it may be helpful for management to step back and
try to see if there are any major differences between what the
company is practicing vs. what the company is preaching.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was hurt by a friend who said some mean things to me in
front of our group. She blamed me for something that is not my
fault, and now she somehow thinks I owe her an apology. I
approached her and tried to patch things up, and she treated me as
if I was a child. I am fuming inside, and I do not know what to do.
P.O.
</P>
<P>
   A: You have already tried to take care of your friendship, but
now it is time to take care of yourself. Even if your friend's
comments were entirely accurate, she was absolutely wrong to voice
them in front of your associates. And, for that if for nothing
else, she owes you an apology.
</P>
<P>
   Granted that it is not particularly enjoyable to have someone
upset with you, at this point there is not much left for you to do.
If you approach this person again, you are going to hear her play
parent again.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be surprising to find that your friend has some
other baggage that she is bringing to work, and for whatever
reason, she dropped it on you. Since this type of behavior
presumably is not typical of her, perhaps as she handles whatever
personal matters have been upsetting her, she will realize what she
has done and will take steps to mend things.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is for you to go on with your business, be friendly and
cordial with her, and let some time pass. If she is a real friend,
this incident shall also pass.
</P>

WORKER CHECKS GET THE BOOT AT WESTERN WEAR
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARITA, Calif. _ Congressman Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon
and his brothers may have closed their chain of country wear
stores, but former employees at the company said Monday they have
been left holding a bag of bounced checks and broken promises.
</P>
<P>
   Howard and Phil's Western Wear, based in Santa Clarita north of
Los Angeles, closed its remaining stores two weeks ago, surprising
many workers who say they were promised the stores would stay open.
A liquidation firm will sell the remaining assets Thursday to pay
off creditors.
</P>
<P>
   But former employees say the chain's closing is the least of
their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Employees from several stores say they have had problems cashing
company paychecks, and many say those checks have bounced.
</P>
<P>
   Former Burbank store manager Steve Gehrt said his paycheck and
those of four other employees bounced. Those checks were for the
pay period before the company closed its doors, he said, and
employees have yet to receive their closing check.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrt estimated that about $4,000 in wages have not been paid to
the store's workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our own little world, that's a lot of money,'' he said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Matwiczak, former manager at the company's Valencia
store, said she was one of the ``lucky ones'' who got her last
paycheck because she left before the company shut down.
</P>
<P>
   But Matwiczak said she also had problems with her last check.
</P>
<P>
   After several attempts at cashing the check failed because she
was told there were insufficient funds in the company's accounts,
she said the company canceled the check and issued her another for
half the amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to file a police report because the check was
bouncing,'' she said. ``There's a lot of unhappy people, that's for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard and Phil's spokesman and co-owner Joseph McKeon was
unavailable for comment, his assistant said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman McKeon, a 20 percent owner of the chain his parents
founded in 1962, said Monday through a spokesman that he was
unaware of the situation and had not been active in the company
since he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1992. He
had no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The company had over 50 stores at its height, but it declared
bankruptcy and began reorganizing in 1996 after sales plummeted. It
had only 16 stores earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Employees told the Daily News they have filed or will file wage
claims with the state Department of Industrial Relations, but they
may have to wait in line for the company's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Liquidation firm Development Specialists Inc. plans to sell the
company's assets Thursday in a business liquidation procedure under
state law that is similar to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy under federal
law.
</P>
<P>
   The largest secured creditor, Los Angeles-based Coast Business
Credit, has a blanket lien on all the assets that is worth about $3
million. A secured creditor generally takes priority over other
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Fryer, spokesman for the state Department of Industrial
Relations, said he was unsure who would get priority over the
assets.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the state will pursue workers' claims regardless of
who has priority in the asset sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employer has the responsibility to pay their debts,
including wages due to the employees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the employer does not pay back the wages due to the
employees from the assets of the sale,'' Fryer said, ``we may have
to pursue the issue in the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be soon enough for people such as Patricia D.
Lehman, former assistant manager at the company's Burbank store and
a two-year veteran of the firm. Lehman said her last $498 paycheck
bounced and she has not received her final check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got bills that need to be paid and no checks to cover
them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My phone's going to be shut off because of all this, because I
can't pay it,'' she said. ``It's been real hard.''

VITESSE TO ACQUIRE `NETWORK-ON-A-CHIP' FIRM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. _ In an effort to increase its presence in the
growing Internet processor market, computer chip maker Vitesse
Semiconductor Inc. said it will acquire a small Northern California
firm for $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of high-speed, gallium arsenide chips used in the
telecommunications industry said it will buy Santa Clara-based
XaQti Corp., a 35-employee maker of ``network-on-a-chip'' products
used to direct the flow of data across the Internet. The purchase
will be financed entirely with stock of Vitesse, based in Camarillo
in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts greeted news of the merger positively, saying the
companies' strengths should complement each other. ``I like the
acquisition,'' said Arun Veerappan, an analyst at BancBoston
Robertson Stephens. ``It's a step in the right direction for
Vitesse.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors also appear pleased, bidding up Vitesse stock $1.375,
or 2.7 percent, to $52.625 on a day when the technology-heavy
Nasdaq exchange fell 66.54 to 2453.66.
</P>
<P>
   The XaQti purchase will be accounted for as a pooling of
interests and is expected to have no material impact on Vitesse's
financial results, the company said. The transaction is expected to
be completed by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both companies said the acquisition should broaden
their potential customer base. Vitesse had 1998 sales of $175
million, mostly to the telecom industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of synergy in technology between Vitesse
and XaQti,'' Alak Deb, co-founder and chief technology officer of
XaQti said in a written statement accompanying the announcement.
``The merged companies will bring together complementary core
competencies to develop high-performance and cost-effective data
communications solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential new customers include Internet backbone companies and
Internet service providers.

 &HT;    Ohio school system to react drastically to unfavorable audit
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dayton public school officials will seek to close
as many as five schools, lay off an undetermined number of
employees and privatize some transportation services to respond to
a state audit that estimated the district could be as much as $14
million in the red within five weeks, school officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The ``performance audit'' conducted by the state auditor's
office revealed the extent of the district's financial shortfalls,
criticized school officials for earlier financial projections that
auditors concluded were far too rosy and detailed sloppy
record-keeping by the district. The audit also concluded the
district spends a disproportionate amount of money on
administration and other support services at the expense of
instruction. The report's 170 recommendations, if implemented,
could result in potential annual savings of $25 million to $42
million, Auditor of State James Petro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This school district's financial condition is treacherous,''
said Petro, who announced the audit's findings Monday in a joint
news conference with Superintendent James Williams. If no action is
taken, the school district could face an accumulated deficit of
$39.8 million in four years, Petro warned. The district's annual
budget is about $184 million.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he did not get good information from the
treasurer's office and should not be blamed for the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking this beating,'' the superintendent said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted the shortfall could rise to $19 million without cuts in
the district's $184 million general fund budget.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning audit results shocked schools administrators, board
members and union officials, who wondered how a district thought to
be in good financial shape could end up with such a huge deficit.
Board members ended the day snipping at each other during a secret
session some deemed inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The report on the Dayton public schools is one of 21 such
``performance audits'' Petro's office is conducting on Ohio's
largest-enrollment school districts at the request of state
legislators. The Ohio General Assembly in 1997 mandated performance
audits for the 21 largest districts that share a special allocation
of state funding, and Petro's office has found similar financial
shortfalls and practices to criticize at other school districts. In
Cincinnati, for example, Petro's audit projected a deficit of
$260.3 million within five years and recommended $53 million in
annual cuts to teaching staff, transportation, technology and
facilities. In Parma, a district about half Dayton's size, a
performance audit projected a $45 million deficit by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Dayton school officials must develop an
``economy and efficiency plan'' within six months to respond to the
performance audit. Williams said he will appoint business leaders
and other community members to a task force to help craft that
plan. The superintendent said he expects the efficiency plan to
embrace some of the 170 recommendations while challenging others.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams isn't waiting for the task force report before
taking action. Although the performance audit calls for the
district simply to analyze building capacity and consider whether
school closings are justified, Williams said he would recommend
closing five school buildings as a first step toward erasing the
projected deficit. The superintendent said he has identified the
five buildings targeted for closure, but he declined to name them.
</P>
<P>
   Board President Ed Hickman said he believed the board would look
favorably on Williams' proposal. The school closings, Hickman said,
``will have to happen'' because of declines in enrollment and
steeper declines on the horizon due in part to competition from
charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he would also recommend the board cut 20
administrative positions, hire another firm to bus more than 1,600
private- and parochial-school students the district now transports,
and conduct a review of staffing needs among the teaching and
clerical ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The audit suggested that the school district could trim between
590 and 744 jobs by bringing its staffing levels to a level that
compares with similar districts. And the audit said the district
could eliminate up to 41 teaching positions if all teachers were to
teach the amount of minutes called for in their union contract with
the school district, a finding that appears in similar fashion in
other performance audits around the state as well.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Fulwiler Shawhan _ president of the Dayton Education
Association, the union representing the district's teachers _
called the audit's projected deficits ``devastating,'' in part
because they came as a surprise. Board president Hickman
acknowledged the size of the potential deficit did ``sneak up on''
him and fellow board members.
</P>
<P>
   Shawhan said school officials should ensure that budget cuts are
made in a way that has the least impact on students in the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he wanted to spare teachers of kindergarten
through third grade from any cuts, noting the school district's
announced goal of having a student-to-teacher ratio of 15 to 1 in
those grades. That would focus any cuts to the teaching staff to
grades 4-12, though Williams also noted he would have to negotiate
such details with the teachers' union. The DEA's current contract
with the school district expires June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent said he would like to close and consolidate
offices now located in the former Roosevelt High School to save
money and would use enrollment data as a primary criteria to target
school buildings for closure. WHIO-TV Channel 7 reported the five
targeted schools are the Longfellow Center, Jane Addams Elementary
School, Residence Park Elementary School, Whittier Elementary
School and Fairport Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the schools targeted for closure might be
converted into charter schools, which would operate privately and
would be free of some state rules and restrictions in return for
improving academic achievement. Williams said he would seek to
invite community groups to apply for the school board's approval to
convert the schools to charters.
</P>
<P>
   Declining enrollment is to blame for much of the pessimistic
projections, Williams said. While the district has lost on average
a few hundred students each year the last few years, to about
26,000, school officials estimate they'll lose another 2,000 to
3,000 students next year, as charter schools take a bite out of the
district's enrollment base.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the district has been slow to respond to the
enrollment projections.
</P>
<P>
   The performance audit found some school district's practices
worthy of praise, including its development of a strategic reform
plan, which has been used as a model for other districts in Ohio;
for pursuing lower prices for goods and services through a
purchasing co-op; and for providing comprehensive training for
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall tone of the inch-thick, 448-page report is
critical. For example, auditors said:
</P>
<P>
   The school district supplied inaccurate and unreliable
information to state officials' education database, reporting no
salary for the superintendent in 1997-98 and reporting the annual
salaries of many professional positions in two digits such as $28
and $29.
</P>
<P>
   School officials furnished state officials with three different
figures to reflect the number of full-time-equivalent employees
ranging from 3,317 to 3,929. The information was ``inconsistent and
could not be fully explained, which raises questions about the
district's ability to truly manage and budget for their largest
expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   The district's underestimation of 1998 salaries and benefits by
$4 million to $5 million resulted in the school district canceling
some bill payments to help avoid a year-ending deficit.
``Departments will be expected to pay for prior-year obligations
out of current-year budget. These situations make it more difficult
to ascertain the true financial condition of the district,'' the
audit said
</P>
<P>
   The school district's transportation department ``is not
operating effectively or efficiently,'' with higher costs compared
to other districts.
</P>
<P>
   School officials attempted to provide auditors with an updated
financial projections in March, but auditors did not incorporate it
into the report ``because certain projected amounts are unrealistic
and are not supported by written assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the performance audit took the school district to task
for sloppy record-keeping and oversights, it also included a
reference to one of the Dayton area's largest employers as ``AT&AMP;T
Global Information.'' AT&AMP;T spun off the former NCR, which dropped
its Global moniker in favor of its original name, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton School Board met later Monday afternoon, and the
Dayton Daily News protested when the board voted unanimously to go
into a secret meeting to discuss ``personnel'' _ after the district
said the meeting would be open.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting. Hickman had said the board planned to meet
in closed session not to discuss personnel, but to talk about what
the district needs to do as a result of the audit. The Daily News
complained, citing the state's open meeting law, and the schools
said the meeting would be open after all. But shortly after the
start of the 5 p.m. meeting, the board went into secret session.
The closed session lasted about an hour, and then the board meeting
was quickly adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Nellie Terrell, who requested the session, later
said the board discussed the ``behavioral problems of our
superintendent.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickman acknowledged that the members argued about whether they
should be meeting secretly to discuss the audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that this happened,'' he said. ``I'm praying
to God the board gets its act together. (We should) make sure we
focus on this (deficit), instead of some little nitty gritty that
doesn't amount to a hill of beans.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the board said it went into executive session to
discuss employment matters, but at the end of the five-hour meeting
said it met to prepare for Monday morning's press conference.

CALIFORNIA CITIES TO SUE GUN MAKERS OVER SALES METHODS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mich., Ill., N.Y., Mass., Ga., S.C., Fla.)   (jw) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two groups of California cities, led by Los Angeles and San
Francisco, will file suit against gun manufacturers on Wednesday in
a novel use of a sweeping state business law that government
officials and gun-control advocates hope will force the
manufacturers to change the way they market firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits will accuse the manufacturers of providing weapons
to disreputable dealers, and to dealers in areas with lax controls,
knowing that these people were likely to sell guns to criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Nine other cities, plus Wayne County, Mich., have already filed
suit against the gun industry since November, but gun-control
advocates say they expect the California lawsuits to be especially
threatening to the gun makers because of the number of cities
involved, their size and the broad nature of the state
business-practices law under which they are bringing suit.
</P>
<P>
   The California business-practices law allows cities and
individuals to sue over accusations of broadly defined ``unlawful,
unfair and deceptive business acts and practices'' and to collect
large fines and a share of the defendants' profits.
</P>
<P>
   James Hahn, the city attorney for Los Angeles, said of his
city's lawsuit, ``We think it sends a big, important message to the
gun industry that there are a number of cities in California that
have had to deal with the cost of human suffering from guns and
that we are united.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Hahn said, ``It's not about the money; it's about changing
the way they do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise Renne, the city attorney of San Francisco, concurred,
saying that what made the California lawsuits different from the
previous ones was that the goal of Los Angeles and San Francisco
``is not so much money but reform of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Delfay, the president of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition
Manufacturers Institute, the largest gun industry trade
association, said evidence for the accusation of deliberately
supplying guns to the illegal market was ``nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you could do it if you wanted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delfay, whose group was to be named as a defendant in both
suits, along with 28 manufacturers and distributors and two other
trade organizations, said: ``There is no way for a manufacturer to
know a specific firearm is going to be used in crime. If there was,
I'm certain all manufacturers would sacrifice that sale in a New
York minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry would be more threatened by financial penalties
than the tobacco industry was to similar threats because the gun
industry is much smaller. Sales of handguns, rifles, shotguns and
ammunition combined were only $1.4 billion in 1997, compared with
sales of $48 billion for the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Several cities have felt that while they have been blocked from
getting meaningful gun control in Congress and state legislatures
by politicians friendly to the National Rifle Association, they
would have a much better chance in court in front of an urban jury
familiar with the costs of gun violence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With the experience of the states' multibillion-dollar
settlement with the tobacco companies in mind, the cities feel they
do not have to actually win a lawsuit but rather bring enough suits
to threaten the gun manufacturers and make them ready to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Rand, a lawyer for the Violence Policy Center in
Washington, a group that does gun-control research and advocacy,
said the California lawsuits were significant because ``these are
the biggest cities in the biggest state, and for the first time a
group of cities are coordinating.'' Moreover, Ms. Rand said, ``They
will have a big advantage because the California law is very broad,
a kind of super consumers protection law.''
</P>
<P>
   James McCall, a professor at the Hastings College of Law in San
Francisco, part of the University of California system, said the
law being employed by Los Angeles and San Francisco had become a
sweeping tool that had been broadly interpreted by the California
Supreme Court and provided for judges to award large amounts of
money. But the attack on the gun makers is a novel application of
the law, McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   To make their case, he said, the cities will need to show a
violation of state or local law and prove a conspiracy to sell guns
to criminals and juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento, Oakland, and Berkeley are expected to join in the
San Francisco suit, to be filed in state court in San Francisco,
and Compton and Inglewood are expected to join with Los Angeles in
filing suit there, officials said. San Diego and Long Beach may
join in the Los Angeles suit, and some counties in Northern
California have discussed joining the San Francisco suit.
</P>
<P>
   The suits charge that the gun makers have created a distribution
system to deliberately ``insulate themselves from any
responsibility'' for whom the guns end up with, Hahn said.
``Basically, the gun makers supply the illegal underground market
by flooding the legal market with far more guns than it can
absorb.''
</P>
<P>
   This view, similar to accusations made in lawsuits by Chicago
and Detroit is based on information compiled in recent years by the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as it has traced
the flow of guns used in crimes back to the manufacturers and then
the wholesalers and down to the dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The firearms agency has found that large numbers of guns used in
crimes in cities like New York, Boston or Chicago, with restrictive
gun-control laws, were originally sold in states with lax
gun-control laws like Georgia, South Carolina or Florida to illegal
gun traffickers. Many of these guns used in crimes, perhaps half,
are sold new in stores to criminals or straw purchasers acting on
their behalf, and gun control advocates and many law-enforcement
officials now believe the gun makers must be to some degree aware
of what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this belief is that when the firearms agency
traces a crime gun, it goes back to the manufacturer to start the
tracking process, a clear clue to the company that the gun has been
involved in questionable acts.
</P>
<P>
   The California suits also charge that the gun makers have failed
to incorporate sufficient safety devices in their products, like
child safety locks or gun technology that would only allow the
legal owner to fire the gun. Similar accusations have been made in
lawsuits by other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Under the business law, the cities cannot collect damages, Hahn
said, but they can collect fines, of $2,500 per count, and
``disgorgement'' of profits. This could amount to millions of
dollars, he said, because the cities say each gun sold illegally is
a separate count.

NLRB DENIES BID BY DOCTORS TO UNIONIZE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a setback to doctors' efforts to unionize, the National Labor
Relations Board's regional office in Philadelphia ruled Monday that
more than 500 New Jersey doctors working for a health maintenance
organization were independent contractors _ not employees _ and
therefore could not form a union.
</P>
<P>
   As labor unions have sought to persuade thousands of doctors
nationwide to unionize, the New Jersey case was widely viewed as an
important test case because it concerned whether doctors
contracting with an HMO should be considered employees and thus
have the right to form unions.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second time that the doctors had made their case to
the labor board's Philadelphia branch. But last August, after the
local board rejected the doctors' arguments, the national board
overturned that ruling and ordered a hearing to get a ``fuller
picture'' of the relationships between doctors and HMOs. It was the
first time the board had heard testimony on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The union the doctors sought to join, the United Food and
Commercial Workers, argued that the doctors were employees of the
HMO, the Amerihealth Corporation of New Jersey, because Amerihealth
controlled many of the details of their work, such as the maximum
wait for patients, the size of their waiting room and whether
patients should undergo surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the union's argument, the labor board's regional
director, Dorothy L. Moore-Duncan, concluded that the doctors were
independent businessmen because they ran their own practices, were
free to contract with other HMOs and worked at their own offices.
In addition, she noted that Amerihealth had little control over the
doctors because its patients represented just a small fraction _
normally 4 percent _ of their overall practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physicians lack the close economic relations and
integration with Amerihealth that would support a finding of
employee status,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's decision, Ms. Moore-Duncan rejected a petition by
Local 56 of the United Food and Commercial Workers to hold an
election in which 515 primary care physicians and specialists in
Atlantic and Cape May Counties were to vote on whether to join the
union.
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. O'Brien, the union's lawyer, said the union was still
debating whether to appeal the decision to the labor board's main
office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision contains pages and pages of facts that strongly
point to these doctors' employee status,'' O'Brien said, ``but then
it wrongly concludes that they're entrepreneurs, which flies in the
face of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Several officials from other unions said the Amerihealth
doctors' situation represented an unfavorable set of circumstances
for a test case. These officials said unions would have been better
off to have asked the national labor board to examine a case
involving an HMO that maintained far more control over their
doctors than Amerihealth did and accounted for far more _ perhaps
50 percent _ of the doctors' caseload.
</P>
<P>
   G. Fred DiBona Jr., chairman of Amerihealth, said in a statement
that Monday's ruling ``clarifies a question of considerable
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The NLRB decision agrees with virtually every point we have
made over the past 18 months,'' DiBona said, ``including the facts
the doctors own their own businesses, compete with each other,
contract with a large number of insurers, make their own hours and
are the sole beneficiaries of their successes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the United Food and Commercial Workers repeatedly insisted
that the doctors were tantamount to part-time employees because the
HMO controlled so many details of their practice. For instance,
Amerihealth requires that the doctors' offices maintain certain
records, be open a certain number of hours each week and allow
visits by Amerihealth inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore-Duncan concluded that the doctors' extensive
independence from Amerihealth outweighed the amount of control the
HMO had over them.
</P>
<P>
   Labor experts estimate that 35,000 of the nation's 700,000
doctors are in unions. The recent acceleration of efforts to
unionize doctors have focused on salaried staff physicians at
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, when private-practice physicians have sought to
bargain collectively with HMOs over reimbursements or other
matters, the doctors have been accused of violating antitrust laws,
charged with being independent businessmen conspiring to restrain
trade. Many private-practice doctors are urging Congress to enact
an antitrust exemption that would let them bargain with HMOs.

 &HT;    Texas makes 64-team field for NCAA tournament
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After Texas players and coaches were rewarded a
berth in the NCAA baseball playoffs Monday, they received an
encouraging message from someone who knows about second chances.
</P>
<P>
   Texas football coach Mack Brown, whose own team started 1-2,
rebounded with one of the most memorable seasons in a decade. There
is no reason the baseball team can't have a similar finish, Brown
told the players after they watched the selection show on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, staggered by a 1-7 finish, is one of six Big 12 teams
invited to the 64-team NCAA regionals.
</P>
<P>
   Texas (35-24) will be the No. 3 seed in a regional at the
University of Houston. The Longhorns will play No. 2 seed
Southwestern Louisiana (38-22) at 3 p.m. Friday. Top seed Houston
(38-22) will play No. 4 Southwest Texas State (27-30) at 7 p.m.
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The double-elimination tournament will continue through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we've got the good news, we don't have to worry any
more,'' Texas catcher Sam Anderson said. ``Like Coach Brown said,
we have a great opportunity in front of us, and it's up to us to
take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Big 12 teams invited to the regionals are Texas A&AMP;M, Texas Tech,
Baylor, Nebraska, Oklahoma State and Texas. Missing from the mix is
Missouri, which made a strong bid by winning 11 of its last 13
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas-Missouri debate most likely was determined by the
latest RPI poll. The Longhorns, who played one of the toughest
schedules in the country, are No. 31 in the poll. Missouri is No.
50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players earned it with the schedule they played and the
games they won,'' Texas Coach Augie Garrido said. ``They're in the
tournament as a result of their power rating. I don't think this is
a gift. It's something they earned.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has a 28-3 series advantage over Southwestern Louisiana,
the Sun Belt Conference champion. The Ragin' Cajuns finished their
season last weekend with consecutive losses. Texas and USL are
unranked.
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12 and the Southeastern Conference landed six teams
apiece in the field. The Atlantic Coast Conference had five and the
Pac-10 four.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Houston regional will be paired against the
winner of the regional in Lubbock. That regional includes host
Texas Tech (40-15), Rice (52-11), Wisconsin-Milwaukee (30-27) and
Rutgers (37-19).

 &HT;    Governor likely to sign colonias bill
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Senate on Monday approved and sent to
the governor a bill that would help the poorest of the state's
poor, who live in substandard border-region neighborhoods called
colonias, obtain modern water and sewer services. The measure also
would crack down on the development of new neighborhoods without
basic sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who shaped the legislation through his
secretary of state and border liaison, Elton Bomer, indicated he
would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very strong piece of legislation,'' Bush said. ``It
will give the state more tools to stop the spread of colonias and
improve conditions for people living there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had directed Bomer to make colonias his top priority after
a series of articles last year in the Austin American-Statesman
drew attention to the slow pace and other problems with the
water-sewer program. In some cases, households had not been hooked
up to water and sewer lines installed years earlier. And in one
colonia in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, a toddler fell into an
outhouse and drowned at a time when local government officials were
squabbling over which city or water district would serve that
neighborhood. The measure builds on a 10-year-old, $579 million
sanitation program financed jointly by the federal government and
the state. It injects a modest amount of additional money _
$331,000 a year for a six-person team of troubleshooters _ into the
program and grants new enforcement powers, planning tools,
regulatory oversight and flexibility to state and local agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Senators, who concurred with minor changes by the House, said
the bill offers new hope to the roughly 400,000 people living in
colonias. These neighborhoods, which span the Texas-Mexico border
from El Paso to Brownsville, constitute the largest concentration
of people living without basic sanitation in the United States.
Despite the troubling conditions, the residents have a strong ethic
of home ownership and often build their houses one room at a time
as they earn money from migrant labor, retail positions,
construction and other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long, colonia residents have put up with substandard
water, sewer, electricity and other services,'' said Sen. David
Sibley, R-Waco, vice chairman of the Special Committee on Border
Affairs. ``I commend the authors of this bill for their leadership
in passing legislation that will continue to improve the standard
of living for these hardworking Texans.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time that state lawmakers have enacted major
legislation concerning colonias. First, in 1989, they set the
water-sewer aid program in motion. In 1995, they tightened
development rules to curb the construction of new colonias.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bill reflects bipartisan cooperation between a
Republican governor and Democratic Senate and House members
representing the border region. The primary author was Sen. Eddie
Lucio Jr., D-Brownsville, chairman of the border panel. Democratic
Sens. Judith Zaffirini of Laredo, Carlos Truan of Corpus Christi
and Eliot Shapleigh of El Paso co-authored the bill, and Rep. Henry
Cuellar, D-Laredo, sponsored the measure in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think never before in history, in Texas, have we witnessed
such bipartisan and nonpartisan support for colonias,'' Bomer said.
``I expect a good helping of improvements for people along the
border who don't have access to water and sewer lines.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks and months, Bomer and the Texas Water
Development Board, which administers the program, have launched new
initiatives intended to hook up thousands of households to water
and sewer lines.

WHITMAN'S NOMINEE IS CONFIRMED AS ATTORNEY GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JERRY GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman's nominee for attorney
general, John Farmer Jr., was confirmed unanimously by the state
Senate Monday, winning the the state's top law enforcement job at a
time when the office and the state police are under intense
scrutiny because of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came two weeks to the day after Farmer's predecessor,
Peter Verniero, was narrowly confirmed by the Senate for a seat on
the state Supreme Court after a nomination that was troubled, in
part, by Verniero's response to reports of racial profiling by
state police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am obviously overwhelmed by the vote today,'' Farmer said in
a brief speech on the floor of the Senate in which he avoided any
mention of the controversy that has clouded the office in the last
year. ``I am flattered and humbled.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer, who has been the governor's chief counsel for the last
two years, assumes his new job immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general oversees the New Jersey State Police, which
means Farmer will inherit several contentious issues. These include
finding a new superintendent for the state police and dealing with
low morale among the ranks of state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman forced the resignation of the previous
superintendent, Col. Carl Williams, in February after he said in a
newspaper interview that members of minority groups were primarily
to blame for drug trafficking in the state. Mrs. Whitman, and now
Farmer, are being pressured on one side by those who want the new
superintendent to be an outsider, perhaps someone from out of
state, and on the other side by those who want the new leader to
come from the department.
</P>
<P>
   During his confirmation hearing Monday morning, Farmer got a
hint of just how heated an issue that may become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to regret my vote here if you go outside New Jersey
for a new superintendent of the New Jersey State Police,'' said
state Sen. Raymond Zane, one of the Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer said the list for a potential superintendent was down to
five candidates, and he said that a selection would be made next
month. But he told the committee that he would make no assurances
about who that nominee would be.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's nomination sparked none of the partisan rancor that
Verniero's did. Both Democrats and Republicans praised the
nomination during his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary
Committee early in the day and from the Senate floor Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero stepped down as attorney general on May 14, and is to
begin his first term on the Supreme Court in September upon the
retirement of Justice Stewart Pollock.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the furor over racial profiling put Verniero
at the center of a political firestorm. It started in April 1998,
when state troopers shot three unarmed minority men during a
traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   That incident highlighted longstanding complaints from black
civil rights groups and leaders that state troopers routinely
singled out black drivers, especially young men, based solely on
race. Verniero waited for nearly a year before beginning a formal
investigation into the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Verniero released a report that said officers in at
least two police barracks _ in Moorestown and in Cranbury _ had
engaged in racial profiling. A week later, he announced that the
state had agreed to negotiate a settlement with federal officials
to avoid a civil rights lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   It will fall to Farmer to complete those negotiations _ the
first in the nation involving a statewide law enforcement agency _
as well as help in the search for a new superintendent and try to
repair some of the damage done to the image of the state police.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer, who is 41, joined Mrs. Whitman's counsel office in 1994
and worked as a senior associate counsel and deputy chief counsel
before assuming the top job in 1977. He has also worked in private
law practice and as a law clerk for Justice Alan Handler of state
Supreme Court. From 1990 to 1994, he was an assistant U.S.
attorney.

KENNETH DONALD GLANCY, 74, A PRESIDENT OF RCA RECORDS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth Donald Glancy, a former president of RCA Records who
helped foster the careers of such disparate artists as Woody
Herman, Pierre Boulez, David Bowie and Cleo Laine, died on Sunday
at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 74 and had homes in
Manhattan and Cagnes-sur-Mer, in southern France.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   At one time or another, Glancy had charge of the artists and
repertory of Columbia Records, Columbia's European operations and,
in the 1970s, all RCA labels worldwide as president and chief
executive. He left in 1980 to found his Finesse label and issue
albums by Mel Torme, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Paul Desmond and Ms.
Laine. He retired in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Springfield, Mass., Glancy interrupted his studies at
Amherst to serve as a technical sergeant in the Army Corps of
Engineers in Britain, France and Belgium during World War II. On
his return, he prepared for a teaching career at the University of
Michigan. He was working on his doctorate in English when necessity
changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   Married by now, he took what he thought would be a temporary job
as a salesman for Columbia Records. Instead he was promoted to
Midwestern sales manager, visiting stores and distributors to make
sure Columbia's records were selling well.
</P>
<P>
   He also learned the record business from the ground up as he
moved to the company's artists-and-repertory division. By the early
1960s, he was the vice president responsible for all production,
from classical to pop to jazz. But a boardroom upheaval at Columbia
prompted his reassignment to London with a mission to salvage the
faltering British division.
</P>
<P>
   Glancy turned it around with a series of hit records, causing
RCA to rescue its similarly ailing British branch. Music Week, a
British trade paper, noting Glancy's quiet way of getting things
done, wrote as he prepared to return to New York after eight years:
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made an oustanding success of the two companies which
he has run in this country. And it's probably a measure of the man
that he has done so without ever seeming to try _ at least in
public.''
</P>
<P>
   He was named president of RCA Records in 1973, when it was a
subsidiary of RCA Corporation. (RCA's labels now belong to the
Bertelsmann media empire, while Columbia's are owned by Sony.) In
recent years, while retired, Glancy stayed actively in touch with
the classical and jazz music worlds in the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Maida Kaperst Glancy; a daughter
from an earlier marriage, Suzanne Gallagher of Canton, Mich.; two
grandchildren, and one great-grandson.  &QL;

 &HT;    Wildfire blankets coast with smoke
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A behemoth, 12,000-acre wildfire burning
in the far reaches of western Palm Beach County smothered three
counties in smoke Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, ignited by lightning Friday in the northern half of
the Rotenberger wildlife preserve, quickly spread from just 1,200
acres about 11:30 a.m. Sunday when Division of Forestry rangers
were first called to battle it, said Dave Utley, chief of the DOF's
Everglades District. With winds blowing from the west, a steely,
gray blanket of smoke and hot, dry air cloaked the coast from
Delray Beach to Fort Pierce for most of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a fire that large, it puts up huge volumes of
smoke and when you've got the wind direction that's favorable _ or
not favorable to you all _ you're going to feel the effects,''
Utley said. ``Unfortunately, the wind direction is interfering with
the tactics we'd like to use to extinguish it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire in the 27,000-acre preserve went unnoticed for two days
because winds from the east fanned smoke west into uninhabited
wilderness. But on Monday, winds swung to the west, sending rolling
clouds toward civilization and alarming hundreds of residents on
the Treasure Coast who still anxiously watch the skies following
terrifying fires last month that destroyed 43 homes in a single
night.
</P>
<P>
   One Martin County dispatcher logged 142 calls during a single
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is still concerned and I don't blame them,'' said St.
Lucie Fire District spokesman Lt. Ron Parrish.
</P>
<P>
   Winds shifted when a high pressure ridge in the Atlantic drifted
south, the National Weather Service said. Usually, the ridge rides
further north over Bermuda during the summer and blows sea breezes
along the east coast. Meteorologists even have a name for it: the
Bermuda High. It is this ridge that creates our all too familiar
soggy summer trade winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not in the summer yet, so it's not unusual to get
the ridge to the south,'' said meteorologist Tom Warner. ``It's
just a stroke of bad luck, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The winds will continue from the west through Wednesday, bad
news for rangers who had hoped to protect a string of electrical
lines near the fire's northern edge that supply power to the west
coast, Utley said. The fire is burning about two miles from the
towers, an uncomfortable, but not yet dangerous distance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still two miles from the lines, but there's no break that
would prevent it from burning down to the lines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the fire strikes the energized lines, it would act like a
circuit breaker, triggering ``a blackout somewhere.'' Utley said
the fire, fueled by saw grass and trees, is surrounded on three
sides by canals that should help contain it: the Miami Canal to the
east, a levee on the Hendry County line to the west and the L-4
canal on the south.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday and Monday, eight rangers on all-terrain vehicles tried
to control the flames, but the fire was burning too intensely. If
winds shift to the southeast, rangers will use a helicopter from
Fort Meyers, loaded with explosive plastic balls, to ignite
backfires, Utley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually this time of year, we get lightning strikes that burn
a couple of acres and go out. But with the dryness of the
vegetation and soil,'' he said, ``it's going to keep going until it
runs out of fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, forestry officials worried that spring would
plunge the state, still recovering from wildfires that scorched a
half million acres last year, into a dangerous drought because of
La Nina conditions. In recent weeks, rain has increased but much of
the state, particularly wilderness areas in the heart of South
Florida, remain parched and ready to ignite. In addition to Port
St. Lucie's April fires, 3,611 fires have burned 274,581 acres
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   A 600-acre fire grew tenfold Monday in the Osceola National
Forest and jumped a highway into the 400,000-acre Okefenokee Swamp.
</P>
<P>
   After frantic callers insisted the Treasure Coast was burning
Monday, the Martin County Sheriff's Office sent a helicopter to
search out flames, Parrish said. Only two relatively small fires _
a 100-acre fire in the western part of Martin County and one about
36 acres on the Indian River and St. Lucie counties line _ were
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, health officials in Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie
counties urged people with respiratory problems to stay indoors
with their air-conditioners on. Meteorologists predict the smoke
will continue today, with the wind blowing at about 10 mph from the
west.

JAMES BLADES IS DEAD AT 97; A PERCUSSIONIST FOR VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Blades, a popular British percussionist whose most
frequently heard work was the ``V-for-victory'' Morse code signal
broadcast by the BBC during World War II, died on Wednesday at his
home in Cheam, in Surrey, England. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   He also created the sound of the gong at the beginning of movies
made by the J. Arthur Rank studios; his recording was mimed by a
boxer, Bombardier Billy Wells.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable sound he made, however, was the
dot-dot-dot-dash ditty of Morse code that the BBC broadcast to
encourage the Resistance in continental Europe during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The recording, transmitted 150 times a day, echoed the
da-da-da-dum phrase that begins Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. To
create the signal, he used a tympani mallet to strike an African
membrane drum, essentially a tom-tom, with the sound damped with a
handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the greatest noise I ever made,'' he said, according
to an obituary published on Saturday in The Daily Telegraph of
London.
</P>
<P>
   Blades, who also played tympani, xylophone, marimbas and more,
performed with circuses and symphonies and in the cinema. He was
also a lecturer, mesmerizing audiences that ranged from teen-agers
and the disabled to music teachers and professional musicians.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of an encyclopedic reference work,
``Percussion Instruments and Their History'' (Praeger, 1971), which
detailed everything from the aburukuwa to the zuzu.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anything you want to know about percussion, old or
new, consult Blades,'' wrote Harold C. Schonberg in The New York
Times in a review of the book.
</P>
<P>
   Blades was born in Peterborough, England, on Sept. 9, 1901. He
fell in love with drumming while watching a member of the Salvation
Army banging a bass drum. He received his first musical training
from an uncle who was fond of beating his knife and fork on the
dinner table. When he was 14 he joined a circus, in which he played
the cymbals and a bass drum, providing the beat for a dancing
elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Later Blades began performing in local bands and dropped his
apprenticeship in engineering. He spent most of the 1920s working
at a movie theater, creating sound effects for silent movies _
gunshots, thunderstorms _ and playing in dance bands around
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932 he joined the London Film Society Orchestra; he also
played the Rank gong beginning in 1935. Sought after by symphonies
in the United States and Britain, Blades joined the London Symphony
Orchestra in 1940 and moonlighted with other orchestras and
ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Blades was occupied mostly with operas,
symphonies and chamber music. He was also invited to join the
Coronation Orchestra in Westminster Abbey in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, he was appointed a professor of percussion at the Royal
Academy of Music. He also lectured, often working with physically
and mentally handicapped children. He put his engineering skills to
use making the children instruments, like a glockenspiel for
quadriplegics to play using their mouths. He retired from public
performances in 1971, except for the premiere of Benjamin Britten's
opera ``Death in Venice'' in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``Percussion Instruments and Their History,'' Blades
wrote ``Orchestral Percussion Technique'' (1961); ``Drum Roll''
(1977), an autobiography, and a second, shorter autobiography,
``These I Have Met'' (1991). He was made an officer of the Order of
the British Empire in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, Olive Hewitt, died in 1945. He is survived by
his second wife, Joan Goossens. &QL;

VANESSA BROWN, 71, AN ACTRESS IN FILM AND ON BROADWAY 
NORMAN ROSSINGTON, BRITISH ACTOR ONSTAGE AND IN FILM, 70
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vanessa Brown, who originated the role of the girl upstairs in
the Broadway production of ``The Seven Year Itch,'' a role played
in the film version by Marilyn Monroe, died on Friday at the Motion
Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, her son, David, said.
</P>
<P>
   Born Smylla Brind in Vienna, Ms. Brown was blessed with beauty
and an I.Q. of 165 that she said made her feel ``squirmy.'' Her
family fled the Nazis when she was 9, moving first to France and
then to New York, where she came to the attention of the Broadway
producer Herman Shumlin. He offered her the role of a 10-year-old
Viennese girl in his production of Lillian Hellman's play ``Watch
on the Rhine.'' Her parents refused to allow her to leave school,
so she understudied Ann Blyth and stepped into the role when she
was 13.
</P>
<P>
   While in Chicago with the play, she was a guest on the radio
show ``Quiz Kids,'' and did so well that she was offered and
accepted a regular spot on the panel. After two years in radio, she
returned to New York and, finding life dull, moved to Los Angeles.
She made her first movie, ``Youth Runs Wild'' (1944) at 16 while a
student at Hollywood High. While in college she signed a seven-year
contract with 20th Century Fox, and appeared in such movies as the
1950 ``Tarzan and the Slave Girl,'' in which she swung from trees
with Lex Barker; ``The Heiress,'' and ``The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown returned to Broadway in 1952. Her stage career
included the tour of ``As You Like It'' with Katharine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   In later years Ms. Brown turned to politics and writing. She was
a delegate to the 1956 Democratic Convention and was active in the
Presidential campaigns of Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy. As a
freelance correspondent for the Voice of America, she covered
topics including politics, science and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her son, David, and a daughter, Cathy, both
of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Rossington, a veteran British character actor whose
career embraced films, theater and television, died on Friday in a
hospital in Manchester, England. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, according to his agent, Marilyn Collis.
</P>
<P>
   Rossington was born in Liverpool, began acting in a community
drama club and eventually moved to Bristol, where he received his
early theatrical training and eventually began acting at that
city's Theater Royal.
</P>
<P>
   His rumpled features _ he once described himself as having ``a
mug like a jug'' _ made him a natural for character roles, and he
soon found work in films. He appeared in ``Carry On Sergeant,'' the
first of that comedy series, and went on to play supporting roles
in ``Carry On Nurse'' and ``Carry On Regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossington made more than 40 films, including ``Lawrence of
Arabia,'' ``Saturday Night and Sunday Morning,'' ``A Hard Day's
Night'' with the Beatles, ``Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying
Machines'' and ``A Night to Remember.'' He also appeared in the
Elvis Presley film ``Double Trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a familiar figure on British television, starting with
``The Army Game'' in the 1950's and continuing into the 1970s,
playing comedic as well as dramatic roles.
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared in ``I Claudius'' and was the gravedigger in a
production of ``Hamlet'' that starred Richard Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Rossington's theater credits included productions of ``Around
the World in 80 Days'' and ``Guys and Dolls,'' in which he played
Nathan Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   His most recent stage appearance was in the London production of
``Beauty and the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Cindy. &QL;

<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Addison Joseph Hepburn is either an
unwitting Bahamian fisherman tricked into participating in a
Haitian smuggling operation or an inhumane killer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a Broward County, Fla. jury decides.
</P>
<P>
   Hepburn, 44, told the jury Monday that U.S. Border Patrol agents
forced him to confess to being the captain of a boat that ferried
33 Haitian immigrants to a sandbar 100 yards offshore near the
Jupiter Inlet in August. He has been charged with smuggling
immigrants, smuggling for financial gain and smuggling which
resulted in death.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say Hepburn left the Haitians to sink or
swim that day. Nineteen swam to shore. Two died struggling to
shore. The bodies of Benette Dorsonne and Richard Presendieu were
pulled from the water and the medical examiner ruled their deaths
were the result of drowning. The Coast Guard took the remaining
people off the sandbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they left, I sat there for a while and cried,'' Hepburn
said of the border patrol agents, as tears flowed down his face
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hepburn says he thought there were only a few Haitians, all
legally permitted to enter the United States, on his 23-foot
motorboat when they left Freeport. He said he was hired for $500
and asked to return the boat to the Bahamas after a trip to the
Port of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   He said he learned of other passengers and the smuggling mission
only after piloting the boat far out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Hepburn's attorney, Randee Golder, asked the jury to discount
testimony from Haitians on the boat who fingered Hepburn as the
mastermind of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are lying and I submit to you they are lying to cover up
for one of their own,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hepburn was arrested by federal authorities the morning of Aug.
10, 1998, about 1 mile south of the Jupiter Inlet. Agents found him
sleeping in a broken-down boat anchored not far from a sandbar from
which they earlier had rescued a dozen Haitian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Neil Karadbil said Hepburn repeatedly
changed his story in interviews with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is a tragedy,'' Karadbil said during closing
arguments. ``These people were so desperate they would cram into
the cabin (of a boat) in the middle of the night because that is
what it takes to get to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like the defendant capitalize on that desperation.''

KNICKS SWEEP HAWKS AMID CHANTS FOR THEIR COACH
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Knicks' remarkable transformation from a
team teetering on collapse a month ago to a group with a chance to
turn its season into something special continued Monday night as
they emphatically claimed Game 4 to sweep the Atlanta Hawks and
take their second-round playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Relentless in their barrage of the thin Hawks, the Knicks eased
away for a 79-66 victory and earned the right to play the Indiana
Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals, with Game 1 on Sunday at
Market Square Arena in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Chants of ``Jeff Van Gundy'' filled the Garden in the last three
minutes of the game, a show of support for a coach who has received
no assurance that he will be back next season. And yet, this is the
first time the Knicks have been in a conference finals since 1994
and the third time in the 90s. The eighth-seeded Knicks, who did
not clinch a playoff spot until the second-to-last game of the
season, were led by Allan Houston (19 points), Patrick Ewing (17)
and Latrell Sprewell (11), against the worn and frustrated Hawks,
led by Steve Smith (14 points), Dikembe Mutombo (11) and Mookie
Blaylock (7).
</P>
<P>
   With five days off before the next round, Ewing's sore Achilles'
tendon will have a chance to rest before he faces the Pacers, who
eliminated the Knicks in the second round last year and needed just
five games to do so. After Ewing missed four months after wrist
surgery, he tried to save the Knicks by gallantly returning in Game
2 but failed in his comeback attempt.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Knicks are a much more balanced team.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, who came out and treated the Hawks as if they were a
sheet of paper to charge through in order to get to the Pacers,
were the aggressors from the beginning and continued their assault
the instant the second unit, led by Sprewell, Marcus Camby and
Chris Childs, came into the game.
</P>
<P>
   They were an intimidating group. And the sagging Hawks had to
tremble just a bit as Sprewell and his partners turned steals into
dunks and misses into fast-break opportunities that resulted in a
48-37 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   That edge was not squandered when Houston and Ewing started the
third quarter with a flurry of jumpers and helped put the Knicks
ahead, 66-51, to start the fourth. Ewing was making a mockery out
of Mutombo's wingspan by floating jumpers over his college friend.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that made up the Hawks' personality _ stingy defense,
Mutombo's menacing presence, deadly 3-point shooting _ was
vanishing beneath the determined Knicks, who quickly built a 56-40
lead with 7:33 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   That lead increased to 65-47 with 2:00 left in the third
quarter, and the chants of ``We want Reggie, we want Reggie'' were
ringing out in a crowd savoring the opportunity to see Reggie
Miller in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks played like they wanted him. Instead of being
complacent with their 3-0 lead in the series, the night began with
Houston and Charlie Ward popping 3-pointers and Ewing finding a
groove, which escaped him in Game 3, by hitting 5 of his first 8
shots, bringing misery to his crestfallen Mutombo with every high
arching baseline jumper.
</P>
<P>
   After the Knicks grabbed a 25-18 first-quarter lead, the old
then made way for the new. Sprewell tore off his warm-ups and
stirred up a crowd somewhat bored by the Knicks' dominance of the
Hawks. Sprewell changed all that when he stepped in front of a pass
to Smith and darted to the basket with a two-handed dunk and
two-fisted flex as he ran back down the floor with 6:50 left in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Fearlessly, Sprewell just preyed on the Hawks' interior defense,
flying inside to either score on a dunk or draw a foul. He went to
the free-throw line six times in the first half and left Mutombo
shaking his head at all the foul trouble he had found himself in
courtesy of Sprewell and an aggressive Camby.
</P>
<P>
   Though hampered with back spasms, Camby stuck his neck out on a
couple of occasions and even absorbed a flagrant foul on his way to
the basket with 10 minutes left in the first half. He hit two free
throws to give the Knicks a 29-18 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the ragged Hawks, depending on the will and desire of Smith,
came back and cut the Knicks' lead to 6 points after a foolish play
by Childs. As Mutombo went up for a dunk, Childs wrapped him up and
pulled him to the floor. This might have been Childs' comeback to
the elbow he took from Mutombo on April 9, a blow that knocked out
a front tooth.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed revenge at that time. He didn't need a hard foul to get
it the way the Knicks were blasting away at the Hawks. Still,
Childs was called for the foul and a technical that resulted in 3
points for the Hawks and pulled them to within 6, at 38-32, with
4:33 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the Knicks these days, they had a feisty counterpunch
in them. Childs came back and hit a 19-foot jumper. Three
possessions later, he swiped a steal and was off on a fast-break
layup that broke the Hawks down and gave the Knicks a 44-32 lead
with two minutes left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks were clinging to life, down by 11 points at the half,
but seemed hardly capable of mounting a comeback. The Hawks
finished the first half shooting 33 percent with Smith hitting 4 of
14 from the field and Blaylock giving his team a 2-for-9 effort.
The combination of the Knicks' ability to send fresh bodies at the
Hawks and play suffocating defense had their opponent in a frazzled
state. &QL;

DODGERS PITCHERS OFF TO ROCKY START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Brown, Chan Ho Park and Ismael Valdes were
to create an imposing, if not intimidating, trio of starting
pitchers. Carlos Perez, the lone lefty, and Darren Dreifort would
complement them to form what could be the most formidable starting
rotation in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Clink. Clank. Clunk.
</P>
<P>
   You don't win without solid starting pitching, and in case that
was forgotten, the Los Angeles Dodgers are here to remind everyone.
A quarter of the way into what's so far a disappointing season, the
Dodgers starting rotation is the primary culprit.
</P>
<P>
   The starters do not pitch deep into games, they give up runs
early and they have trouble protecting leads in the middle innings.
It's causing an already fragile bullpen to burn out and is putting
a strain on Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only guy doing his job on a consistent basis is Brown,''
Dreifort said.
</P>
<P>
   The modest standard by which pitching is graded these days is
the quality start _ three earned runs or less in six or more
innings. The Dodgers (22-21) have 13 quality starts in their last
26 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Pitching coach) Charlie (Hough) and I, it's our job to
straighten the pitching out,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``It's location, like in real estate. Movement helps and pitch
selection helps. It's a funny game. The middle (of the plate) is no
good. Outside is no good. It's just a little area on each side,
(and) if you do that, you'll be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Dodgers haven't found the outside portions of the
plate enough. They completed a three-game series against the St.
Louis Cardinals in which Valdes, Dreifort and Perez went 1-2 with a
6.75 ERA and averaged 51/3 innings per start.
</P>
<P>
   Notorious for his rigorous between-starts work ethic, which
includes throwing on the side twice and taking ground balls in the
infield, Brown is averaging more than seven innings per start and
has allowed one run in each of his last three starts. The only
other starter averaging more than six innings per start is Valdes
(4-2, 3.77 ERA). He got off to a quick start, but he lasted just
41/3 innings in his last start.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown signed his seven-year, $105-million contract, general
manager Kevin Malone spoke repeatedly about his influence on a
pitching staff. It's been evident off the field, but in two months
it hasn't translated the way the Dodgers hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly brings something special out there,'' Hough said.
``Most of it is competition, the level he competes at. He's got the
go-get-them kind of personality. I think it's going to get better.
You'll see his influence more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but Park (3-3, 4.78 ERA) spent the first month of the
season with contract negotiations hanging over his head and hasn't
shown confidence in his fastball at crucial stages of game.
Instead, Johnson has criticized him for throwing too many offspeed
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Perez (1-6, 6.39) signed a three-year, $15-million contract in
the offseason and has rewarded the Dodgers with an awful start. His
52/3 innings of four-run ball against St. Louis on Sunday was one
of his better outings.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (5-2, 4.98) is tied with Brown for the team lead in
wins, but his ERA is second highest among the starters. Although
he's had just two quality starts, he's benefited from terrific run
support. In the 47 innings Dreifort's pitched, the Dodgers have
scored 38 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a collection of a lot of little things we're going
through as a team,'' Brown said. ``You have to have an active role
in making things better. Even when you're doing well, you have to
continue to work to be better and not be satisfied. I don't think
that's a problem. It's finding the right thing, and what they have
to be doing to get in a groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ongoing process. It's a matter of hitting your stride.
This is not a unique situation. Staffs go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers staff wasn't supposed to experience such an
elongated slump, which has been prevalent most of the season.
Johnson met with the Dodgers pitchers earlier in the season and
stressed the importance of not trying to be too fine with their
pitches. That didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The pitchers had another meeting before Saturday's game with St.
Louis to discuss how to remedy the mind-numbing problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always the little things that turn into big innings for
other teams,'' Dreifort said. ``You walk a guy, leave a pitch up, a
guy hits a two-run homer. It's just kind of the way it's been. It's
something you have to go out and pitch through. That's the way you
build confidence and get yourself on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown takes a 5-2 mark and his 2.54 ERA into tonight's game in
Cincinnati. The concern isn't how Brown will pitch, but what will
happen the next four days in what is a circle of inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   By National League standards, the Dodgers are successful. Their
starters are second in wins (19), fifth in ERA (4.28), fourth in
innings pitched (265) and sixth in earned runs (126). But so much
more is expected because their expectations are so high. The
Dodgers talked about challenging the Atlanta Braves to be the best
starting five in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers don't even have the best starting five in the NL
West. That belongs to Arizona, which ended the week with a 4.21 ERA
from its starters and a league-best 2942/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good talent. I believe we'll do better,'' Hough said.
``When you look at what the rest of the staffs in the big leagues
are doing, that's how many runs are being scored. There's guys all
over the place pitching with 6 ERAs. When this thing is done with,
this staff is going to be pretty good.''

SPORTS COLUMN: VAN GUNDY COULD FEEL THE TRUTH
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jeff Van Gundy probably did not need to be told it
was true, that Dave Checketts had been talking to Phil Jackson. Van
Gundy could feel it, right between his shoulder blades, from the
lack of enthusiasm at the top of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night Checketts informed the world that Van Gundy is ``a
great, great coach.'' Of course, it took being caught in a lie for
Checketts to issue any kind of support for the coach, who has been
twisting, twisting the spring away, in a vacuum while Checketts
checked out his options.
</P>
<P>
   As far as can be determined, Van Gundy twists still, even though
the Knicks swept their series with the Hawks with a 79-66 victory
Monday night and will play the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern
Conference finals, beginning Sunday in Indianapolis. Checketts said
he would take care of the issue after the season, but he fell far
short of any concrete praise for Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   If one wanted to trust raging instinct, it would almost seem
that Checketts has already decided that Jackson is his kind of
big-time guy, and that by bringing in Jackson to run the Knicks
next year Checketts could virtually assure that Patrick Ewing would
finish his career back home in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick has the right to say whatever he wants,'' Checketts
said rather coldly Monday night, when reminded that Ewing has said
he adamantly refuses to play for Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ewing's strong and uncharacteristic stand, Checketts met
with Jackson in mid-April, and soon afterward dismissed Ernie
Grunfeld as team president and general manager. When Mike Wise
reported the meeting with Jackson in The New York Times on Sunday,
Checketts at first denied it, but in a news conference Monday night
he admitted that the meeting had indeed taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that I lied about it,'' Checketts said. ``I misled
the press. I misled Jeff Van Gundy.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts spoke with Van Gundy before the game. The coach would
not discuss what was said, but he seemed to be in a controlled
sense of purpose, holding in his true feelings _ anger, contempt,
sadness.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most pathetic things Checketts said Monday night was
that he did not know Van Gundy very well and wanted to observe him
up close for the rest of the season. Checketts is, after all, the
president and chief operating officer of Madison Square Garden and,
as he reminded everybody Monday night, ``I was a general manager in
this league; I know a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he did not know the coach of his own team very well and
felt the need to meet with somebody who was a visible burr to his
own captain, and then, in his own words, lied about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I erred on the side of trying to protect everybody,''
Checketts explained.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to fault Checketts for planning for major
contingencies. That is what chief executive officers must do.
However, the new people who currently own the Knicks cannot
appreciate the spectacle of their top executive bringing them such
ugly publicity. If Van Gundy is still on probation for next season,
what does that say about the status of Checketts?
</P>
<P>
   The new people might ask why Grunfeld and Van Gundy were
squabbling so divisively, and why Checketts didn't bang their heads
together and say, ``Get it together, you knuckleheads.''
</P>
<P>
   And the new people might ask whether Phil Jackson was a wise
alternative even a month ago, when the Knicks were in the doldrums.
Jackson is far from the self-styled maverick who worried that his
counterculture image would work against his ever getting hired as
an assistant coach in the league.
</P>
<P>
   After dealing with people as diverse as Michael Jordan, Jerry
Reinsdorf, Jerry Krause, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, Jackson
has developed the thick hide of a survivor.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks employed a similarly massive ego a few years back. It
all ended badly with charges that Pat Riley was an ambitious and
duplicitous careerist who used a fax machine to announce his
departure from the happy little family of the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Dave Checketts could have made Van Gundy
feel good about the prospect of remaining with this organization.
That prospect may have faded.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy is young and healthy, not totally naive or helpless,
and further ahead professionally than he might ever have expected
for a point guard from Nazareth College. Plus, as Lenny Wilkens,
who has coached all over the map and made the Hall of Fame, put it,
``There's always another job.'' The crowd chanted ``Jeff Van
Gundy'' toward the end Monday night but the prospect of another job
might appeal to Van Gundy right about now. &QL;

WE OWE DEL HARRIS AN APOLOGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I want to take this opportunity, on behalf of Jerry Buss, Jerry
West, malevolent radio sports talk show hosts, myopic sportswriters
and athletic followers throughout Southern California, to offer my
most humble apologies to Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   You were right all along, Del, and we were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   You were cruelly sacrificed as coach of the Los Angeles Lakers
at mid-season supposedly because you no longer were able to
communicate with your players.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in light of the unpleasant events that have swirled around
the Laker orbit since your involuntary departure that climaxed
Sunday with the team being swept out of the playoffs by the San
Antonio Spurs, you have been totally vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   The Laker players also refused to listen to your successor, Kurt
Rambis, who vainly preached teamwork, who vainly tried to get
Shaquille O'Neal to concentrate on defense, who vainly tried to put
some restraints on Kobe Bryant, who vainly tried to alter his
interim coaching status with tactical moves that continually turned
out to be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Lakers this season wasn't Del Harris, who
actually knows how to coach, or even Kurt Rambis, who doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who knows a moving screen from a John Stockton flop can
tell you that the Lakers' two top players, Shaquille O'Neal and
Kobe Bryant, haven't the faintest idea of how basketball is
supposed to be played at least team basketball.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen selfish, egotistical jocks with wildly inflated views
of their self-worth across the seasons, but I'm not sure any can
surpass Bryant, a nice enough young chap with a pleasant
personality who displays about as much discipline on the hardwoods
as a 4-year-old does at a day care center.
</P>
<P>
   If I could, I'd like to lift Bryant upside down from his
sneakers, shake some sense into his noggin, and force him to repeat
after me, ``I'm not Michael Jordan and I'm not going to take
anymore wayward shots and, instead, I solemnly promise I'm going to
start looking to pass to open teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   I put my palms over my ears when naive people keep telling me to
be patient with Kobe Bryant because he is only 20 years old and
still is learning the game.
</P>
<P>
   I keep telling such Bryant propagandists that, as John Wooden
constantly has insisted, basketball isn't that difficult a game to
learn, that Bryant stubbornly has refused to play within a team
framework, that Bryant isn't nearly as good as he thinks he is, and
that Magic Johnson had mastered the sport to such a dizzying level
by the time he was Bryant's age that he led the Lakers to a world
title.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way any team is going to win an NBA title, much less
even make it to the Western Conference finals, when it possesses a
player as self-centered as Bryant, who hogs the basketball with a
scandalous disregard for teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is no way a team can even avert a four-game
playoff impalement when its so-called superstar center, Shaquille
O'Neal, isn't in proper physical shape, plays erratic defense,
doesn't know how to pass out of double teams, and becomes such a
terrible offensive liability that he's better off on the bench in
the closing minutes of tight games because of his horrid free throw
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   As a loser, Shaquille O'Neal makes Wilt Chamberlain, affixed
with such a label throughout his career because of his annual
post-season flameouts to Bill Russell's Boston Celtics, look like a
rousing winner.
</P>
<P>
   If I were Jerry West, I'd give O'Neal a tape of Tim Duncan's
exploits against the Lakers and force O'Neal to spend three hours a
day in the off-season studying it.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and Spurs still would be playing had O'Neal been able
to make, oh, half of his free throws, which he was unable to do
during the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If Shaq was only able to display the same zest for practicing
foul shots that he does for eating he can stand to drop those 50 or
60 unflattering pounds that have impacted his defensive quickness
then I'm sure he would no longer humiliate himself almost every
time he lumbers haplessly to the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bryant, O'Neal, who's 27, still hasn't learned the deft
subtleties of his sport, as evidenced by the mere two assists he
managed during the series with the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   How could a guy like O'Neal who's constantly engulfed by
defenders wind up with such a meager total in four games?
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious O'Neal needs a Klieg light to spot an open
teammate. Wilt Chamberlain once actually led the NBA in assists.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a more self-indulgent player on the Lakers than Kobe
Bryant and I'm not sure that's humanly possible it would have to be
Shaquille O'Neal, who takes just as many indiscreet shots as Bryant
and doesn't exactly seem passionately stirred by competitive
juices.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, one can point to more reasons for the Lakers' latest
unraveling than the shoddy antics of Bryant and O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers still don't have a first-rate point guard, although
at least Derek Fisher isn't timid about playing hard-nosed defense,
which makes him unique on this pacifistic Laker team.
</P>
<P>
   They also could use a power forward able to consistently grab
rebounds and hold his own with the likes of Tim Duncan. J.R. Reid
tries, bless him, but he's simply not very good.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice is a good shooter, but the Lakers, true to form, never
were able to find him enough open looks.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry and Rick Fox also are talented players, but their
skills were thoroughly squandered on perhaps the stupidest Laker
team I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what those two lovable Jerrys, Messrs. Buss and
West, will be able to do in the upcoming months to prevent another
post-season Laker collapse next spring.
</P>
<P>
   You have a serious dilemma when your two marquee performers,
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, not only don't understand even
the most basic fundamentals of basketball, but also aren't
particularly fond of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a strong-willed coach like Chuck Daly, who resigned from
the Orlando Magic Monday, is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   But, remember, Del Harris also was strong-willed, and look what
happened to him during another disappointing Laker season in which
the beleaguered Harris at least is left with the last cackle.

N.Y. POLICE OFFICER WILL PLEAD GUILTY TO ASSAULTING IMMIGRANT
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS to add 700 words starting with 8th graf after optional trim,
beginning: Volpe's decision.)  (rm) 
 By ROBERT McFADDEN and JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Confronted with devastating testimony by fellow
officers and a crumbling defense, the policeman accused of
torturing Abner Louima in the bathroom of a Brooklyn station house
in 1997 will plead guilty to all charges Tuesday and throw himself
on the mercy of the court, his lawyer told a federal judge Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With chances of an acquittal all but gone and prosecutors
rejecting any plea bargain in a case that stunned the city and the
nation, the officer, Justin Volpe, appeared to have no choice but
to admit that he rammed a broom handle into the rectum and then
into the mouth of the handcuffed Haitian immigrant in a fit of
rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to enter a plea tomorrow,'' Volpe's lawyer,
Marvyn Kornberg, told Judge Eugene Nickerson in U.S. District Court
in Brooklyn. The request took place during a quiet conference of
defense lawyers and prosecutors at the bench at 3:45 p.m.,
signaling that his client had abandoned all but the hope of
leniency.
</P>
<P>
   While the trial of four other officers accused in the case was
expected to continue, a guilty plea by Volpe would end his
involvement in the most explosive New York police brutality episode
in decades. Its horrors have been compared and contrasted to those
of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West African immigrant slain by four
officers in a hail of 41 shots last February.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Monday night that he would withhold
comment until the plea was entered Tuesday, and Police Commissioner
Howard Safir also declined to comment. The mayor and the
commissioner, often outspoken in their defense of police officers,
have been silent in the Louima case.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the other defendants indicated Monday that they were
prepared to go on with the trial. Kornberg declined to comment on
whether Volpe would testify for the prosecution, or whether, in
offering his plea, he would implicate any of the others. Other
lawyers in the case said it was unlikely that he would testify, and
what he would disclose in his plea appeared to be up to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   By pleading guilty to violating Louima's civil rights in a
sexual assault, the 27-year-old Volpe would expose himself to a
maximum sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole.
But under complex federal sentencing guidelines, Nickerson, by
applying all provisions for leniency, including Volpe's acceptance
of responsibility for his actions, could impose a term of 25 to 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts noted that the judge would have wide discretion in
the sentence. Prosecutors were expected to argue against any
leniency, on the ground that Volpe decided to plead guilty only
after he saw the overwhelming case against him. Last week, fellow
officers had testified about hearing him brag of the assault and
seeing him brandish the stick stained with blood and feces.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition of pleading guilty, legal experts said, Volpe
would be required to detail his actions on the morning of Aug. 9,
1997, when, officials charge, he and Officers Charles Schwarz,
Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder beat Louima in a patrol car before
taking him to the 70th Precinct station house, where Schwarz
allegedly held him down while Volpe sodomized him with a broom
handle.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which Volpe will tell his story Tuesday _ whether
the actions of other officers will be detailed or even cited, for
example _ will be up to Nickerson, lawyers said. But to insure that
a continuing trial of the other officers not be tainted, legal
experts said the judge was not likely to require any statements by
Volpe of their involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Volpe's statement in open court, which will take
place in the absence of the jury, could amount to a dramatic,
blow-by-blow confession of his own alleged brutality. That has
already been told in testimony by Louima, 32, who suffered severe
rectal and bladder injuries and underwent several operations and
months of hospitalization.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In theory, Nickerson could reject a guilty plea if he thought it
served the interest of justice, but lawyers said that was not
likely in view of the testimony in recent days by Sgt. Kenneth
Wernick, Detective Eric Turetzky and Officers Mark Schofield and
Michael Schoer.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky testified last week that he saw Volpe lead a handcuffed
Louima, whose pants were at his ankles, to the bathroom of the
station house, and later that he saw Volpe, disheveled and sullen,
swinging a stick around ``like a sword and hitting it against a
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Schofield testified that he, too, saw Volpe with a stick, and
said he had borrowed a pair of black leather gloves before the
alleged attack and later gave them back, covered with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg, who had said at the outset of the trial that Louima's
injuries had been caused by consensual sex at a nightclub before a
melee that led to his arrest, and other defense lawyers attacked
the credibility of the police witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the defense appeared to be taken by surprise last Wednesday
when Wernick took the stand and said that Volpe had bragged about
the attack, saying, ``I took a man down tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant said Volpe told him he ``took a stick and put it
five or six inches up,'' and that then he ``took it out and put it
up to his mouth and teeth area, kind of like showing it to him.''
He said Volpe also showed him the section of broomstick, two to
three feet long, in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   After first saying he intended to cross-examine the sergeant,
Kornberg reversed himself and asked no questions. He also did not
cross-examine Schoer, who testified that Volpe had taunted him by
putting the excrement-tainted stick near his face.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's decision to plead guilty came on a relatively routine
day, in a trial dominated by prosecution witnesses whose shocking
evidence had made daily headlines. The defense had not even begun
to present its case.
</P>
<P>
   There was testimony Monday by prosecution witnesses about
Volpe's allegedly falsified report of the circumstances in which
Louima and a second Haitian immigrant, Patrick Antoine, were
arrested on the streets around a Flatbush nightclub called the
Rendez-Vous.
</P>
<P>
   Police had been called there after a melee broke out outside the
club. In that melee, Volpe was struck by someone _ it is unclear
who _ and the enraged officer apparently mistook Louima for that
assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine had not been involved in the melee, but was seized
walking home several blocks away; Volpe's report put him in the
middle of the melee. Antoine, like Louima, was beaten, but their
injuries were listed in the Volpe report as having been sustained
in the melee.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses who testified Monday included a surgeon who told
of injuries to Louima's rectum and bladder, and of having operated
on Louima at Coney Island Hospital. Federal agents and police
investigators also told of blood spots and blood found in the
police car where the officers were said to have beaten Louima.
</P>
<P>
   But as the testimony droned on, reporters at midafternoon were
told privately that a major break was imminent, that Volpe had made
a decision to plead guilty to all the charges against him:
depriving Louima and Antoine of of their civil rights, conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and witness tampering. The last charge arose
because Volpe allegedly told Louima after the bathroom attack that
he would kill him if he ever told about it.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, Wiese and Bruder are charged with violating Louima's
civil rights by beating him in the patrol car en route to the
station house. In addition, Schwarz was accused of participating in
the sexual assault of Louima by holding him down in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth defendant, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, is charged with trying
to cover up the beating in the police car, and of arresting Antoine
on false charges to cover up his beating.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:45 p.m. Monday, after a series of huddled conferences
involving the defense lawyers and prosecutors led by Alan Vinegrad,
the chief of the criminal division of the U.S. attorney's office in
Brooklyn, Kornberg asked Nickerson for a conference at the bench
and disclosed his client's intent to plead guilty Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In view of the plan to enter a guilty plea, Vinegrad asked that
Volpe, who has been free on bail pending the outcome of the trial,
be placed under house arrest. Under that arrangement, he was
allowed to return Monday night to his parents' home on Staten
Island, where he has been living, and would return to court Tuesday
in the company of Kornberg.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe might have entered his plea Monday, but was said to have
wanted to spend a last night with his parents. His father, Robert
Volpe, is a retired New York City police detective who was renowned
as an investigator of art fraud and art thefts. Volpe's bail was
expected to be revoked after his plea.
</P>
<P>
   No court session had been planned for Tuesday because the wife
of one defense lawyer was expected to give birth. The jury had been
given Tuesday off; had that not been the case, Nickerson would have
had to send the jury out during Volpe's plea, so that its judgment
about the other defendants would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the jury have been instructed not to read or listen
to news accounts of the case, and they are expected to arrive in
court Wednesday unaware of any plea. They would see only an empty
chair where Volpe sat. The judge would instruct them that the case
against one officer has been disposed of, and that they were not to
consider that in judging the case against the others.
</P>
<P>
   Vinegrad had no comment Monday. Stephen Worth, the lawyer for
Schwarz, said he had no intention at the moment of calling for a
mistrial. Joseph Tacopina, Stuart London and John Patten, the
lawyers for Wiese, Bruder and Bellomo, respectively, said they
intended to go ahead with their clients' defense.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE SPREWELL PUZZLE IS THE OPPOSITE OF EASY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The moment comes soon enough, and it belongs to
Latrell Sprewell, and no one else. The coach calls his name
sometime during the first quarter, and the building erupts as soon
as he stands up. Sprewell does not start the game at Madison Square
Garden. He restarts it, and jams it into the highest possible gear.
</P>
<P>
   This much-debated deployment that Jeff Van Gundy settled on for
Sprewell _ part by circumstance, part by choice _ not only gave a
team-in-progress much clearer focus, it offered New York fans a
direct voice line to the player so viscerally and forgivingly
adopted as the replacement for the most popular Knick of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   John Starks once resisted coming off the bench, but ultimately
came around to the energizing buzz, to the electric moment that
belonged to him. Sprewell is not likely to embrace this position,
no matter how much farther in these playoffs it carries him and the
Knicks. If we know anything about this explosive talent beyond his
hyperactive capacity to break down the defense, it is his ability
to convince himself that any decision rendered by others is a
direct affront to the one he makes for himself.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the man has a persecution complex the size of
Pittsburgh, which is no easy way to go through a season, or life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latrell,'' Chris Childs profoundly stated last week in
Atlanta, ``is the opposite of easy.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Atlanta Hawks and the Eastern Conference
semifinals were concerned, it was easy, over and out Monday night,
the Knicks sweeping with a 79-66 no mas victory, setting their
sights on the conference final and their matchups for the Indiana
Pacers. After the paper-thin Heat and handicapped Hawks, here comes
an opponent that has as much roster definition as it has depth.
Here come Antonio Davis, Jalen Rose and Derrick McKey, all arms,
legs and disruption, charging on call off Larry Bird's bench.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes the only team left in the playoffs, Western
Conference included, with the defensive components to
simultaneously challenge Sprewell and Allan Houston, to put the
new, improved Knicks to the in-your-face acid test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd be in this position,'' Sprewell said, in
one of those moments when he comes off reasoned and willing, and
his comeback story is one to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the best spot of his basketball life, the grand stage
of a conference final, in New York City, against Reggie Miller and
his cast of odd-shaped pieces which form a most beguiling
basketball puzzle. Sprewell could not have imagined a better spring
for himself as he waited out the lockout, in limbo, for the
inevitable trade from Golden State. And despite this run, his first
taste of playoff success, there is the mind-boggling issue of what
Van Gundy and the team has asked of him.
</P>
<P>
   There is yet another coach, like every other Sprewell has played
for, who has dared to impose his unwelcome will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't always see eye to eye,'' Van Gundy had to admit after
Sprewell cursed him and his substitution scheme during Game 2 in
Atlanta. This choice of words evoked memories of Anthony Mason, on
the Knicks' bench, avoiding eye contact with Pat Riley, at all
costs. For all his talent, Mason's unacceptable flaw was his
incessant need to prove himself right. And that is Sprewell, who
choked his coach and sued the league and blamed his agent and then
has the temerity to curse Van Gundy three months after the Knicks
brought him to New York to remake his career.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is not just a very good player who wants to
start. It is the circumstances _ in a supposed redemptive season
cut short by 32 games and further reduced by his injured foot _
under which Sprewell has let his displeasure be known, with his
minutes and the coach. Forget compromise. This is his American
Dream. These are his terms.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell has certainly earned his cheers, but the last thing he
needs to hear is a defense of his bench-role blues because he
happens to be the best player on the team. Maybe next season _ if
there is a next season for him in New York _ he will have a better
case against Van Gundy or some other coach. Then again, maybe
Sprewell never gets another chance to play this deep into spring.
These runs are fickle. That ball that rolled off Terry Porter in
Miami, Game 5, could have rolled off Sprewell instead. Athletes can
always leverage themselves into more money and minutes, but
Sprewell has been granted a chance to jam the Knicks into a gear
that even the Pacers might not match, right on into the
championship round.
</P>
<P>
   He just has to wait a few minutes to restart the game, as Jalen
Rose does for Bird. For this truncated season, Van Gundy made the
right team call. Hopefully, for his sake, Sprewell can enjoy this
role, this stage, and those clamorous moments when Van Gundy calls
his name and the Garden responds.
</P>
<P>
   These should be the best times of his basketball life, far from
the opposite of easy. &QL;

LAKERS MIGHT SEE OFFSEASON SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Stoic expressions and resigned tones filled
the Lakers' quickly emptying locker room in the wake of another
sweep from the playoffs. Underlying all their carefully chosen
words was the harsh realization that another quick exit has
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones, Nick Van Exel and Del Harris couldn't win a
championship soon enough and they were sent packing. Who's next?
The Lakers don't know yet, but as they packed up their belongings
Monday, a day after being swept from the conference semifinals by
the San Antonio Spurs, they braced for a different kind of clean
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The coach might not be retained, several starters might not be
back and even the executive vice president won't guarantee he'll be
here when the Lakers open the 1999-2000 season at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West deferred any answers on interim coach Kurt Rambis or
the state of several players' contracts but did imply he'll be the
one deciding those issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell you I fully intend and I hope to complete my four
years here,'' West said, referring to the contract that starts next
season. ``I don't want that to be any more of a story than it has
been in the past. But to say that I don't get frustrated would not
be the truth. It really is how to manage the stress and frustration
of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   So West will try to deal better with the strain, attempt to
stave off further meddling from owner Jerry Buss _ who signed
Dennis Rodman over West's objections _ then return to the task of
trying to put the Lakers in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   First, he has to settle on a coach. And then, who will return to
play for that coach.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis' fate is unclear and West declined to give a timeline for
that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll have more responses for you people in a
couple of weeks, after I meet with Jerry Buss and the other people
on our staff to determine where we're headed,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis believes he's earned the chance to prove himself during a
normal season _ i.e., not a compacted 50-game slate that included a
change in coaches, the Rodman drama and a major trade. ``A crazy
season,'' as Robert Horry put it.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of players declined to endorse Rambis, and certain
influential players clearly had problems with him, but a few
offered praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned,'' Rambis said. ``I made some mistakes, but I
learned. I think I did a good job. Basically, no one had to go
through the type of season that I had to go through, so there's
nothing to really compare it to. . . . I wish things would have
worked out differently, but given the circumstances, the cards I
was dealt, I thought I did a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Lakers mull that decision, the clock is ticking for
sharpshooter Glen Rice. The Lakers have until July 1 to either
exercise a $7.1 million one-year option or give Rice the
multimillion-dollar extension he wants. If they take no action,
he'll join a long list of Lakers free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Starters Derek Fisher and J.R. Reid and reserves Rick Fox and
Ruben Patterson are free agents as of July 1. And Derek Harper, a
part-time starter, might retire.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the small matter of Shaquille O'Neal's option to
terminate the remaining four years of his contract. Opting out
would mean sacrificing millions because of the league's new labor
deal, but O'Neal has stopped short of guaranteeing he'll return.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he dodged the issue entirely by skipping the
postseason team meeting _ as he's done every season here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to win and he'll do it at all costs,'' said Fisher,
who thinks O'Neal will be back. ``He doesn't have any financial
concerns. Whatever decision he makes, it will be about winning a
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and Fox want to return. Reid is noncommittal. Harper is
taking a wait-and-see approach. And Rice, frustrated over his role
in the offense, nevertheless wants to be a Laker for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers don't trade Rice, and O'Neal stays, they will
again form a dangerous, if volatile, core with Kobe Bryant on a
team that will again be favored to contend for a title. And maybe
all the Lakers really need is not a wholesale makeover but a real
training camp and full 82-game schedule to become a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have the pieces,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a terrible basketball team,'' West admonished.
``We have a talented basketball team here, and we're competing
against our past success. . . . We lost in four straight games to a
team with the best record this year. And those are the things that
we will be remembered for, but I will tell you this is a pretty
darn good team. If we can retain the parts that we want to retain
and maybe add a couple players that will provide us a little bit
different look on our bench, we think we're very, very
competitive.''

PARENTS OF 14-YEAR-OLD CONSPIRATOR CLAIM TEXAS AUTHORITIES
OVERREACTED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MARCOS, Texas _ The parents of one of four Wimberley boys
who admitted to participating in a plot to attack their local high
school say prosecutors railroaded the youths through the justice
system, ignoring signs that the boys were basically big talkers
with a fondness for firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be naive parents,'' said Stella Armstrong,
the mother of one of the 14-year-olds. ``But they made something
small into something very, very big.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the four boys pleaded ``true,'' the juvenile court
equivalent of guilty, to charges of conspiracy to commit arson.
Prosecutors say the boys planned to arm themselves with explosives,
take over Wimberley High School in the year 2001 and hold the
campus hostage for $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most dangerous explosives seized by law
enforcement agents during searches of the boys' homes a month ago
were rifle shell casings stuffed with firecrackers. Police records
show that authorities also confiscated a film canister with BBs in
it and atop it, a smoke bomb, in addition to a clear plastic
container filled with gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Armstrong said the container, taken from his son's room, is
the type that comes out of a gumball machine rather than a
Tupperware container. Stella Armstrong said the explosives, all
fireworks, were left over from a family New Year's party.
</P>
<P>
   Other evidence included instructions on how to assemble a pipe
bomb downloaded from the Internet and a computer disk, apparently
with a school report on the atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were they going to bring the roof down in the next 15
seconds?'' said Hays County District Attorney Michael Wenk. ``No.
But they were actively engaged in the planning of a criminal act
and they crossed the legal threshold.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Armstrongs describe overzealous law enforcement
officers, mean-spirited prosecutors and a judge who they say called
their son ``a monster'' in court. Despite their strong objections,
they say officials interrogated their son and the other three boys
for eight hours without a lawyer or a parent present.
</P>
<P>
   When the couple protested, they say they were told by assistant
District Attorney Patrick Keaveny, ``These boys have no rights.''
Keaveny did not return calls from the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Until late Friday, County Court at Law Judge Howard Warner had
placed a gag order on the case, meaning those involved in it were
forbidden to speak and documents were sealed. Warner said the
search warrant affidavits, among other documents, would remain
sealed.
</P>
<P>
   One defense attorney released some of the information to the
Chronicle on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the boys, including the Armstrong's son, were sentenced
to two years probation after a three-month boot camp at the Hays
County Juvenile Detention Center. The fourth boy was given two
years probation. The Armstrongs said their son pleaded guilty
because prosecutors threatened to charge him as an adult and lock
him up until he turns 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be the rest of his childhood,'' said Stella
Armstrong. ``I wasn't going to take the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of a plot to attack a Wimberley school broke three days
after the April 20 massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo. Those familiar with the case say an eighth-grader at
Wimberley Junior High School told his parents about a plan for some
sort of similar assault, and his parents told him to tell school
officials.
</P>
<P>
   School officials contacted law enforcement authorities, turning
over two spiral notebooks and a sheet of notebook paper from three
of the boys, which included notes by one of the three about killing
people by stabbing them with pencils and ink pens.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities then wired the eighth-grade informant
electronically, using him to ferret out those believed to be behind
the plan. The informant was among five boys detained, but law
enforcement officials later released him.
</P>
<P>
   The four Wimberley boys were held on charges of conspiracy to
commit murder, conspiracy to commit arson and conspiracy to
manufacture explosives.
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports the informant told authorities the
boys were asking other students what they thought of the Littleton
killings, in an effort to find recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the person that was asked said that it was cool or neat,''
the informant said, ``they would be told that there was a group of
students that was going to do the same thing at Wimberley, and
would be asked to join the group.''
</P>
<P>
   The informant said the boys picked the spring of 2001 to carry
out their plan because ``they'll be in high school by then and also
have driver's licenses.'' As an afterthought, he added that the two
years preparation would also give them time to learn the layout of
the high school. The boy also apparently gave authorities an
unwritten hit list.
</P>
<P>
   Though prosecutors believe this evidence to be strong, the
Armstrongs say words like ``neat'' and ``cool'' and talk of
driver's licenses are red flags for 14-year-olds whose bark is
clearly bigger than their bite. One parent whose son is a friend of
one of the boys who was detained says the two still play with Legos
and Ninja Turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Though their son was in trouble with school officials last year
for possession of marijuana, the Armstrongs describe him as
generally a good kid. Unlike the Colorado killers, the Wimberley
youths were not on the fringe. Instead they were represented on the
honor roll, in team sports and in school government.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is devastated,'' said Stella Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said Keaveny, the assistant district attorney, tore up
confessions written by her son three times during his questioning,
saying it was not what he wanted. The couple said their son and the
other three boys were essentially talked into admitting a
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could convince a 14-year-old he lived on Mars if I had eight
hours,'' said Bob Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   The couple said Judge Warner told their son at the time of his
sentencing that ``there are a lot of people in the community that
think you are a monster.''
</P>
<P>
   They quoted the judge as saying, ``I suggest you crawl yourself
into that little hole you dug, stay in for a while and work
yourself out of it to prove to the community you are not the
monster they think you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner declined to discuss the case.

`OLD WICKENBURG' MAY FADE, RESIDENTS OF RETIREMENT HOT SPOT FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICKENBURG _ As the cowboy ambled to the counter to pick up his
store-bought lariat, the sweet smell of leather and oil wafted
through the warm air of Ben's Saddlery shop.
</P>
<P>
   Old Wickenburg. That's what longtime boot and saddlemaker Arlene
Hefner calls it.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of place where ranchers would gossip for hours among
the boot racks during a rainstorm. Where prospectors couldn't get
enough of gold fever milking the mother lode at the nearby Vulture
Mine.
</P>
<P>
   The Old West atmosphere spawned a cottage industry of dude
ranches. ``Out Wickenburg Way'' became the local Chamber of
Commerce hook for tourists. City officials still emboss their
business cards with stagecoaches and galloping horses. The local
museum displays original works of famed Western artists Frederic
Remington and Charles Russell.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Hefner said, Old Wickenburg is an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   She looks out the front door at the modern, suburban-style City
Hall that ``looks like it should be somewhere in Scottsdale.'' The
new pink sidewalks ``give pause to any real (cowboy) walking on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most disturbing sign came last week, Hefner said. That's
when Wickenburg made the top five list of most desirable towns for
retirees in this year's edition of ``Retirement Places Rated''.
</P>
<P>
   `` '' That led to mentions on the ``Today'' show and in ``USA
Today,'' and to a wave of telephone calls to the chamber. More than
100 information packs went out to prospective residents.
</P>
<P>
   `` '' Not that it was unexpected. Senior citizens with money and
different ideas about the town's future have been moving here with
great regularity in recent years. And city officials estimate that
about 60 percent of the town's 6,000 residents are of retirement
age.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Which is just all fine and dandy, says Richard Conklin, a
retired barber from Iowa who has lived in Wickenburg for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old-timers here think things are going to pot,'' Conklin
said. ``But I think the town is doing a mighty fine job of
planning. They are doing everything they can to retain its flavor
and all the new developments here are nice.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem of retirees altering the way things used to be
will only get worse, say Hefner and co-workers Karen Lamontagne and
L.A. Francis. They believe they are on the verge of becoming the
true Sun City West.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun City Grand project near U.S. 60 and Loop 303 means that
sprawl in the northwest Valley has now crept to the halfway point
in the 58 miles between Wickenburg and downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   An extended section of two-lane road on U.S. 60, which turns
into U.S. 89 near Wickenburg, has kept many from traveling to
Wickenburg in the past. But the state's construction timetable
calls for the highway to be all four lane in little more than three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lamontagne said it doesn't take an Einstein to figure out what
will happen next: a corridor of senior citizens from Sun City to
Wickenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Stricklin, Wickenburg's planning director, says he can't
dispute that analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sun City began, that set the geographical direction for
retirement living,'' Stricklin said. ``Then it moved west to Sun
City West and now Sun City Grand to connect the Grand Avenue
corridor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a major economic effort on the part of the state
to attract retirees because they are good for the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricklin said Wickenburg is in an annexation mode _ hoping to
annex enough to preserve its lifestyle, because ``we can't have
Phoenix growing up to our door.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buckeye has annexed property within 12 miles of Wickenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Stewart, a Wickenburg hardware store owner, said he thinks
the high cost of developing land along U.S. 89 southeast of town
will prevent an actual corridor of retiree subdivisions between the
Valley and Wickenburg.
</P>

   Todd ``Paco'' Corbet, a 30-year-old local Realtor who was raised

   Stewart, who moved to Wickenburg 11 years ago from Idaho, said,

is for it to be a combination of the Old West and period
architecture of the 1950s.''

ISRINGHAUSEN DETOURED IN PITTSBURGH ON HIS LONG ROAD BACK
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ There were flashes Mondy night, quick glimpses of
why Jason Isringhausen was once considered the future of the New
York Mets' pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reminders, however, in the Mets' 7-4 loss to the
Pittsburgh Pirates that Isringhausen's long road back from
disappointments and injuries is still far from complete.
</P>
<P>
   In Isringhausen's first major league appearance in 20 months, he
gave up five runs, seven hits (including two home runs) and four
walks in six innings, with seven strikeouts. But he fit right in
with the other Mets' starters, who have a 5.49 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   Isringhausen pitched through the rain, and he pitched in the
cold. But even though Isringhausen left with the Mets trailing by
5-3, it was likely worth the wait for him.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could not get Isringhausen off the hook because they
squandered opportunity after opportunity, leaving 11 runners on
base. The most frustrating moments came in the eighth, when the
Mets left runners on second and third with one out after Brian
McRae's run-scoring double had cut the deficit to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Sprague hit a two-run homer off Turk Wendell in the bottom of
the eighth to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates' bullpen kept the Mets at bay. Jose Silva, a
right-hander with a 7.67 ERA, came on in the fourth inning and shut
down the Mets into the eighth in relief of the starter, Francisco
Cordova. Then a former Mets farmhand _ Scott Sauerbeck, a
27-year-old left-hander whom the Pirates had plucked this winter in
the Rule V draft _ entered the game in the eighth with the tying
and go-ahead runs in scoring position and struck out Benny Agbayani
and Jermaine Allensworth.
</P>
<P>
   Isringhausen's last major league outing had also been against
the Pirates on Sept. 23, 1997, at Shea Stadium. He had fought back
from surgeries on his shoulder and elbow, a broken wrist and
tuberculosis to pitch that year. But on Jan. 13, 1998, Isringhausen
had reconstructive elbow surgery, and he did not pitch at all last
season.
</P>
<P>
   This year Isringhausen was 3-1 with a 2.53 ERA at Class AAA
Norfolk as he waited for the call back to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   It came on Sunday. But as if a year and a half was not long
enough, the 26-year-old right-hander had to wait another 21 minutes
as rain delayed the start of the game.
</P>
<P>
   On Isringhausen's first pitch, Al Martin slapped a double down
the left-field line past a diving Robin Ventura, who was playing in
at third base to deny Martin an easy bunt.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious that Isringhausen was pitching on adrenaline. His
fastball had life in the first and was consistently clocked at 96
miles an hour. On Isringhausen's second pitch, Warren Morris bunted
back to him, too hard for Martin to advance, and Isringhausen had
an out.
</P>
<P>
   Isringhausen froze the next batter, Brian Giles with a crisp
knuckle curve on a 1-2 pitch. For a moment, he was resembling the
23-year-old Isringhausen who had gone 9-2 as a rookie in 1995.
Soon, though, he looked more like Isringhausen who had struggled
through a 6-14 sophomore season in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Young fought him for a full-count walk. Out went Mike
Piazza to try to settle Isringhausen down. It did not work. His
next pitch was a 93-MPH fastball that Jason Kendall blasted over
the fence in left-center field for a three-run home run, and the
Mets were down, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored a run in the third on Piazza's sacrifice fly
with the bases loaded, but they left two runners on base. And then
Morris homered to lead off the Pittsburgh third and make it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets responded with a two-out rally in the fourth, knocking
out Cordova on Allensworth's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Isringhausen's velocity, meanwhile, was down in the 90-93 MPH
range.

SCOTTSDALE MAYOR WANTS MASSIVE CULTURAL THEME PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEXA HAUSSLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   heels of a stadium district victory, Scottsdale Mayor Sam
Campana wants voters' blessing for another massive redevelopment
project: a cultural theme park.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to ask voters Sept. 7 if developers can keep sales
taxes to help pay for a proposed $1 billion mall of museums in
downtown Scottsdale along the Arizona Canal's south bank.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, voters would be deciding whether the project _
billed as a cultural mecca anchored by a Smithsonian-affiliated
museum _ should fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottsdale City Council is to decide tonight whether to put
the theme park question on the ballot, along with another question
involving a financing plan for desert preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The theme park vote will be ``similar to what we did with Los
Arcos,'' Campana said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Scottsdale voters overwhelmingly approved forming a
special taxing stadium district to help finance a proposed $624
million hockey-entertainment complex at Los Arcos Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The theme park election would come two months before another Los
Arcos election to approve a financing plan for that project and six
months before the city's mayoral and council election.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural theme park, called the Canals of Scottsdale, would
be built by a group of developers on a 27-acre site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this project stands on its own,'' said Fred Unger, a
partner in the development group. &UR; ``This is an opportunity to bring
in a cultural component that very few cities in the world have.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for downtown property owners called the news
``wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that we'll have a chance to vote on it, it's the way
it should be,'' said property manager Tom Giller, president of
Scottsdale Focus, an advocacy group for downtown property owners.
</P>
<P>
   Some downtown business and property owners have objected to the
size of the project and plans to buy or condemn about 30 businesses
in the city's arts, craft and Western-theme shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   A state legislative committee agreed in July to let the
developers use a now-defunct 1994 law that was originally designed
to help Gilbert lure an amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows cities to organize a theme park district and use
sales tax revenue _ equaling up to 30 percent of the project's
total cost _ to pay off bonds used to finance the project's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Canals developers would get to keep up to $300
million in state, city and county sales taxes collected within the
project to build roads, parking garages and other public facilities
including renovations to the Galleria, a failed high-end shopping
center. They have pledged to funnel voter-approved preservation and
transportation taxes back to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The developers, which include Galleria owner Excel Legacy Corp.,
would pick up the rest of the project's estimated $1 billion tab.
</P>
<P>
   But they cannot use the theme park financing tool without
voters' approval because of wording in the legislation and the
city's charter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not increasing any taxes, it's changing how they are
used, and you need to go to a vote of the people to approve that,''
Unger said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Campana also wants to ask voters to approve a plan
for the McDowell-Sonoran Preserve that would use preserve tax
dollars to secure financing to protect the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale already has acquired 80 percent of the McDowell
Mountain foothills slated for preservation, using money from a
voter-approved 0.2 percent sales tax increase. But the city still
wants to purchase about 3,000 acres in undeveloped desert to add to
the preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Using expected revenue from the preserve tax to finance the
purchase of private property will allow the city to ``move more
quickly to acquire that,'' said Art Decabooter, chairman of the
McDowell Sonoran Preserve Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really smarter use of the dollars coming in . . . to have
the money available before the prices continue to inflate,'' he
said. &QL;

6 `WIZ' KIDS, 150 WHIZZES AT BEING KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The happy dance was the best part.
</P>
<P>
   During that segment of the audition, the kids were no longer
would-be actors trying for parts. They were just kids again,
throwing their hands into the air, twirling and laughing while
singing, ``Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a song that sticks easily and firmly in your head every
time you hear it. With more than 150 kids trying out for six roles
as munchkins in a touring production of ``The Wizard of Oz'' that
will play at Gammage Auditorium next month, it must have been
permanently carved into the brains of the people picking the
pint-size performers for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Not every kid who showed up at Wells Fargo Arena on the Arizona
State University campus last week to audition carried a
professional resume and glossy glamour shots, but enough did to
remind you that just because the roles were diminutive didn't mean
the ambitions were.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Klein, 9, waited three hours to be first in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a marine biologist or a pediatrician,'' she said
as she affixed an adhesive badge with a ``1'' on it to her
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   What? Not an actor?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that would be if I didn't become an actor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle's dad, Michael, is a rare bird at this kind of thing _
he's honest about his role in the process. &QL; 
PARENTS IN THE WINGS
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an admitted stage parent,'' he said. ``I take her around
to all the auditions and pictures, you name it. Somebody's got to
take her.''
</P>
<P>
   Good for him. Those words _ ``stage parent'' _ are pure poison
to most people, dredging up visions of a claw-fingered harpy
shoving a reluctant, crying child out from behind the curtain and
into the spotlight toward reflected fame and glory.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't how Klein portrayed himself, and, frankly, it wasn't
how he seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to talk her out of it,'' he said, referring to acting,
``but she refused. She's a little ham.''
</P>
<P>
   Again with the honesty. Which is not to say others lied about
their children's ambitions or, more to the point, their own. Lisa
Stark brought Kurt, 11, to the audition because ``he saw it on the
news and wanted to do it.'' No resume, no photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his deal, not mine,'' she said. Like the rest of the
kids, Kurt had dutifully memorized the wicked-witch song.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have his song memorized now,'' Lisa Stark said. No doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Acting experience _ and ambition _ varied among the kids waiting
to go on. Marcus Vizzerra, a 9-year-old dressed sharply in a vest,
gave a simple reason why he would make a good munchkin:
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm short.''
</P>
<P>
   (Marcus, too, had the song down cold. As did his mother,
Melissa. ``I was singing that song in my sleep last night,'' she
said.) &QL; 
THINKING CAP
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Hofferth, meanwhile, sported a green leprechaun hat, which
suggested a munchkinlike look, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use it . . . just to get more in the feel of acting,'' the
12-year-old said of his hat. ``And to get people's attention _ like
yours.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the room where the kids auditioned was where the biggest
differences were found. Allison Queal, a munchkin, citizen of Oz
and flying monkey in the touring company, taught the children a
simple dance step, which they performed in groups of five while
singing the witch song.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, any kid singing, ``Wake up you sleepy head/Rub
your eyes, get out of bed'' while clomping around (the happy dance)
is cute. But some moved uncomfortably and awkwardly, as if they
were wearing wet clothes. Others wore the steely eyed glint and
professional grins of seasoned pros as they moved fluidly.
</P>
<P>
   None of the kids you've been reading about made the final cut.
But that's OK. They looked positively gleeful doing the happy
dance.
</P>
<P>
   Which is more important anyway. &QL;

GUIDES AT TALIESIN WEST GIVE INSIGHT TO GREAT ARCHITECT OF 20TH
CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   make one thing clear: This is not Kitty Hawk, N.C., and Frank
Lloyd Wright is not one of the fathers of modern aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the misconceptions of some tourists, this Wright was one
of the great architects of the 20th century, and some rank him at
the very top. His legacy is the vision that led America away from
the European model of the 19th century and his ability to endure
and thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Wright died in 1959 at 92 after a career that spanned 70 years.
Each time the architectural community tried to retire him, he
rebounded with a new idea, a new vision. He was the original
Comeback Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to last fall's public television series, ``Frank
Lloyd Wright,'' by documentarian Ken Burns, interest has boomed in
such Wright enclaves as Taliesin West, the winter counterpart to
his summertime Taliesin in Spring Green, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   National broadcast of the Burns program and the filmmaker's
appearance at a Taliesin event last fall have brought an influx of
visitors to the Scottsdale facility, where Wright lived from 1937
until his death 22 years later.
</P>
<P>
   But the boom had begun even before the documentary aired,
according to Suzette Lucas, Taliesin West director of external
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a 25 to 30 percent increase over the last three to
four years,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Tours once offered only during the morning in summer have proved
surprisingly popular when offered in the afternoon, as well. More
local residents are discovering the charm of the historic landmark
that sits in their backyard, while out-of-town guests continue to
make up the bulk of the center's many walking tours.
</P>
<P>
   Summer hours begin June 1.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to regular one-hour, 90-minute and three-hour tours,
two new tours are being offered this summer.
</P>
<P>
   At peak season, Taliesin can see as many as 12,000 guests pass
through its portals in a month. Even in summer, visitors still
number around 4,500 monthly. May's totals this year are expected to
reach 9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous tours are offered each day, including the ``Panorama''
tour, which begins at 9 a.m., 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. every day during
the summer, or more often if attendance is heavy. It includes a
visit to the Cabaret Cinema, Music Pavilion, Seminar theater and
Wright's private office, all against the backdrop of the Sonoran
Desert.
</P>
<P>
   For architecture buffs, students and professionals, Taliesin
West ``is almost a pilgrimage,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's unconventional designs were considered the foundation
of American architecture, which finally broke away from the fussy
European, Victorian style of the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   His philosophy emphasized creating buildings and dwellings in
harmony with their surroundings. At Taliesin West, he and
apprentices enrolled at the Frank Lloyd Wright School of
Architecture carried that notion one step further, actually
building the walls of the structures from the stone that forms the
floor of the Sonoran Desert.
</P>
<P>
   True to Wright's vision, Taliesin West's most striking
characteristic is its location at the heart of 600 acres of virgin
desert landscape. The vistas are simply breathtaking. Before
suburban development, visitors could have seen as far as 60 miles,
a guide reports.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Wright stuff necessarily varied from project to
project as befitted its environment, Taliesin West evokes the
familiar geometric Wright, with sharp angles and straight lines
executed in rich woods and textural stone.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast the structures here with Arizona State University's
Wright-designed Gammage Auditorium in Tempe, which is softer and
more curvilinear.
</P>
<P>
   Another myth your tour guide will be happy to debunk: Wright did
not design the Arizona Biltmore hotel in Phoenix. But he did act as
a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Taliesin guides are knowledgeable and eager to discuss the man
and his work. Tours are comfortable, exploring the property indoors
and outdoors, with a chance to sit in Wright-designed furniture. On
hot days, tourgoers are invited to borrow an umbrella to screen the
sun and encouraged to intake ample amounts of water before
venturing out.
</P>
<P>
   The gift shop is well-stocked with Wright merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Even visitors who arrive with just a smattering of knowledge
about Wright will leave knowing him better and with an appreciation
for the philosophy that brings mother nature into man-made
structures.
</P>
<P>
   Those elements are clear at Taliesin West, which, your guide
will point out, is not a museum but a working school of
architecture that accepts only 1 percent of hand-picked applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a beautiful setting, relating to the desert in a
civilized way,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   And she's quick to answer the question before another tourist
can ask: No, neither of the Wright brothers ever lived at Taliesin
West.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it was Frank Lloyd Wright's imagination that took flight. &QL;

SCOTTSDALE MAYOR WANTS MASSIVE CULTURAL THEME PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEXA HAUSSLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   heels of a stadium district victory, Scottsdale Mayor Sam
Campana wants voters' blessing for another massive redevelopment
project: a cultural theme park.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to ask voters Sept. 7 if developers can keep sales
taxes to help pay for a proposed $1 billion mall of museums in
downtown Scottsdale along the Arizona Canal's south bank.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, voters would be deciding whether the project _
billed as a cultural mecca anchored by a Smithsonian-affiliated
museum _ should fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottsdale City Council is to decide tonight whether to put
the theme park question on the ballot, along with another question
involving a financing plan for desert preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The theme park vote will be ``similar to what we did with Los
Arcos,'' Campana said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Scottsdale voters overwhelmingly approved forming a
special taxing stadium district to help finance a proposed $624
million hockey-entertainment complex at Los Arcos Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The theme park election would come two months before another Los
Arcos election to approve a financing plan for that project and six
months before the city's mayoral and council election.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural theme park, called the Canals of Scottsdale, would
be built by a group of developers on a 27-acre site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this project stands on its own,'' said Fred Unger, a
partner in the development group. &UR; ``This is an opportunity to bring
in a cultural component that very few cities in the world have.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for downtown property owners called the news
``wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that we'll have a chance to vote on it, it's the way
it should be,'' said property manager Tom Giller, president of
Scottsdale Focus, an advocacy group for downtown property owners.
</P>
<P>
   Some downtown business and property owners have objected to the
size of the project and plans to buy or condemn about 30 businesses
in the city's arts, craft and Western-theme shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   A state legislative committee agreed in July to let the
developers use a now-defunct 1994 law that was originally designed
to help Gilbert lure an amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows cities to organize a theme park district and use
sales tax revenue _ equaling up to 30 percent of the project's
total cost _ to pay off bonds used to finance the project's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Canals developers would get to keep up to $300
million in state, city and county sales taxes collected within the
project to build roads, parking garages and other public facilities
including renovations to the Galleria, a failed high-end shopping
center. They have pledged to funnel voter-approved preservation and
transportation taxes back to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The developers, which include Galleria owner Excel Legacy Corp.,
would pick up the rest of the project's estimated $1 billion tab.
</P>
<P>
   But they cannot use the theme park financing tool without
voters' approval because of wording in the legislation and the
city's charter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not increasing any taxes, it's changing how they are
used, and you need to go to a vote of the people to approve that,''
Unger said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Campana also wants to ask voters to approve a plan
for the McDowell-Sonoran Preserve that would use preserve tax
dollars to secure financing to protect the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale already has acquired 80 percent of the McDowell
Mountain foothills slated for preservation, using money from a
voter-approved 0.2 percent sales tax increase. But the city still
wants to purchase about 3,000 acres in undeveloped desert to add to
the preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Using expected revenue from the preserve tax to finance the
purchase of private property will allow the city to ``move more
quickly to acquire that,'' said Art Decabooter, chairman of the
McDowell Sonoran Preserve Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really smarter use of the dollars coming in . . . to have
the money available before the prices continue to inflate,'' he
said. &QL;

`OLD WICKENBURG' MAY FADE, RESIDENTS OF RETIREMENT HOT SPOT FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICKENBURG _ As the cowboy ambled to the counter to pick up his
store-bought lariat, the sweet smell of leather and oil wafted
through the warm air of Ben's Saddlery shop.
</P>
<P>
   Old Wickenburg. That's what longtime boot and saddlemaker Arlene
Hefner calls it.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of place where ranchers would gossip for hours among
the boot racks during a rainstorm. Where prospectors couldn't get
enough of gold fever milking the mother lode at the nearby Vulture
Mine.
</P>
<P>
   The Old West atmosphere spawned a cottage industry of dude
ranches. ``Out Wickenburg Way'' became the local Chamber of
Commerce hook for tourists. City officials still emboss their
business cards with stagecoaches and galloping horses. The local
museum displays original works of famed Western artists Frederic
Remington and Charles Russell.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Hefner said, Old Wickenburg is an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   She looks out the front door at the modern, suburban-style City
Hall that ``looks like it should be somewhere in Scottsdale.'' The
new pink sidewalks ``give pause to any real (cowboy) walking on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most disturbing sign came last week, Hefner said. That's
when Wickenburg made the top five list of most desirable towns for
retirees in this year's edition of ``Retirement Places Rated''.
</P>
<P>
   `` '' That led to mentions on the ``Today'' show and in ``USA
Today,'' and to a wave of telephone calls to the chamber. More than
100 information packs went out to prospective residents.
</P>
<P>
   `` '' Not that it was unexpected. Senior citizens with money and
different ideas about the town's future have been moving here with
great regularity in recent years. And city officials estimate that
about 60 percent of the town's 6,000 residents are of retirement
age.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Which is just all fine and dandy, says Richard Conklin, a
retired barber from Iowa who has lived in Wickenburg for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old-timers here think things are going to pot,'' Conklin
said. ``But I think the town is doing a mighty fine job of
planning. They are doing everything they can to retain its flavor
and all the new developments here are nice.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem of retirees altering the way things used to be
will only get worse, say Hefner and co-workers Karen Lamontagne and
L.A. Francis. They believe they are on the verge of becoming the
true Sun City West.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun City Grand project near U.S. 60 and Loop 303 means that
sprawl in the northwest Valley has now crept to the halfway point
in the 58 miles between Wickenburg and downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   An extended section of two-lane road on U.S. 60, which turns
into U.S. 89 near Wickenburg, has kept many from traveling to
Wickenburg in the past. But the state's construction timetable
calls for the highway to be all four lane in little more than three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lamontagne said it doesn't take an Einstein to figure out what
will happen next: a corridor of senior citizens from Sun City to
Wickenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Stricklin, Wickenburg's planning director, says he can't
dispute that analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sun City began, that set the geographical direction for
retirement living,'' Stricklin said. ``Then it moved west to Sun
City West and now Sun City Grand to connect the Grand Avenue
corridor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a major economic effort on the part of the state
to attract retirees because they are good for the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricklin said Wickenburg is in an annexation mode _ hoping to
annex enough to preserve its lifestyle, because ``we can't have
Phoenix growing up to our door.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buckeye has annexed property within 12 miles of Wickenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Stewart, a Wickenburg hardware store owner, said he thinks
the high cost of developing land along U.S. 89 southeast of town
will prevent an actual corridor of retiree subdivisions between the
Valley and Wickenburg.
</P>
<P>
   But the high cost of land and housing within the town, along
with an absence of good jobs, also mean that well-heeled retirees
have the upper hand on purchasing land in Wickenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Todd ``Paco'' Corbet, a 30-year-old local Realtor who was raised
in Wickenburg, said he recently moved to the Valley because he
could buy a house for $40,000 less than for a comparable house in
Wickenburg.
</P>
<P>
   And the older, newer people in And the older, newer people in
Wickenburg are flexing their muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who moved to Wickenburg 11 years ago from Idaho, said,
``It's not our idea for this town to look like Tombstone. Our idea
is for it to be a combination of the Old West and period
architecture of the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the '50s, said Francis, who fashions saddles at
Ben's Saddlery. Francis said he chose to leave Jackson Hole, Wyo.,
after its ``destruction by the Californians'' and move to the
Wickenburg area because of its frontier charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now,'' he said, ``all the old people are destroying all of
that here, too.'' &QL;

`COURAGE' IN SAME PIT AS `HERO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is John F. Kennedy's daughter Caroline on the
``Today''show Monday morning talking to Katie Couric and
denigrating herself and the memory of her old man.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline and her brother, who used to be called John-John, are
on the show to promote the Profile in Courage Award presented each
year by their father's presidential library to politicians who
stick to their principles despite fierce opposition and even
danger.
</P>
<P>
   The award is 10 years old now, and Couric is asking Caroline in
a joking-but-not-quite way if the folks at the Kennedy library are
having a tough time finding politicians with real courage.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline laughs and flashes that famous Kennedy smile and says
that's what people told them when she and her brother began the
awards program.
</P>
<P>
   However, she says, they've found many, many bold and valorous
elected officials out there.
</P>
<P>
   After which I expect her to pause, then say, ``Just kiddin'!''
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   LEAP INTO ABYSS &QL; 
Caroline appears to believe what she is saying, teetering on the
edge of this quaintly naive opinion until she leaps into the abyss
of absurdity by announcing this year's winners:
</P>
<P>
   Sens. John McCain and Russell Feingold.
</P>
<P>
   The senators are being honored for sponsoring federal
legislation that would reform campaign finance laws by severely
restricting the money politicians collect, particularly the
unlimited ``soft money'' donations made to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The bill didn't pass.
</P>
<P>
   Both senators were up for re-election last year. McCain faced a
political novice with no chance of unseating him in a heavily
Republican state like Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The risk he faced was zero.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even that didn't keep McCain from raising millions of
dollars in campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   He crisscrossed the country collecting cash for himself and
other candidates, thinking ahead to his current run at the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, at least, had a well-financed, well-known opponent to
contend with, and he almost lost, mostly because he refused to
accept soft-money donations.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd rather lose than compromise his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   On the ``Today'' show, John-John Kennedy said McCain's big risk
was going against the will of his party.
</P>
<P>
   (Another joke at which no one laughed.)
</P>
<P>
   For his presidential campaign, McCain has drawn to his camp the
kind of high-priced advisers whom conservative columnist Arianna
Huffington describes as ``fixtures in the Washington nexus of
lobbying, political action committees and soft money
contributions.'' &QL; 
TALKING THE TALK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, courageous means only talking the talk, not walking
the walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys could have presented their award to someone who
displayed actual bravery, someone other than a couple of high-paid
dilettantes whose greatest danger was loss of parking privileges at
the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, McCain and Feingold could have turned down the award,
saying adherence to principles is the least we should expect of
people, not the most.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, everyone took the politically correct way out.
</P>
<P>
   And why not?
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time before ``courage'' became as
meaningless a word as ``hero,'' which now defines everyone from
wealthy giants who play basketball to GIs who stumble into a Serb
ambush and get captured without firing a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago, John McCain was locked up in a place where
staunch adherence to principles could have cost him his life.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't waver.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough when the rest of us concoct phony definitions
for things like courage and heroism.
</P>
<P>
   It's different, and much sadder, when someone who's known for
the real thing, like McCain, goes along with us. &QL;

LAKERS MIGHT SEE OFFSEASON SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
 CORRECTS BYLINE... (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Stoic expressions and resigned tones filled
the Lakers' quickly emptying locker room in the wake of another
sweep from the playoffs. Underlying all their carefully chosen
words was the harsh realization that another quick exit has
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones, Nick Van Exel and Del Harris couldn't win a
championship soon enough and they were sent packing. Who's next?
The Lakers don't know yet, but as they packed up their belongings
Monday, a day after being swept from the conference semifinals by
the San Antonio Spurs, they braced for a different kind of clean
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The coach might not be retained, several starters might not be
back and even the executive vice president won't guarantee he'll be
here when the Lakers open the 1999-2000 season at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West deferred any answers on interim coach Kurt Rambis or
the state of several players' contracts but did imply he'll be the
one deciding those issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell you I fully intend and I hope to complete my four
years here,'' West said, referring to the contract that starts next
season. ``I don't want that to be any more of a story than it has
been in the past. But to say that I don't get frustrated would not
be the truth. It really is how to manage the stress and frustration
of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   So West will try to deal better with the strain, attempt to
stave off further meddling from owner Jerry Buss _ who signed
Dennis Rodman over West's objections _ then return to the task of
trying to put the Lakers in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   First, he has to settle on a coach. And then, who will return to
play for that coach.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis' fate is unclear and West declined to give a timeline for
that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll have more responses for you people in a
couple of weeks, after I meet with Jerry Buss and the other people
on our staff to determine where we're headed,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis believes he's earned the chance to prove himself during a
normal season _ i.e., not a compacted 50-game slate that included a
change in coaches, the Rodman drama and a major trade. ``A crazy
season,'' as Robert Horry put it.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of players declined to endorse Rambis, and certain
influential players clearly had problems with him, but a few
offered praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned,'' Rambis said. ``I made some mistakes, but I
learned. I think I did a good job. Basically, no one had to go
through the type of season that I had to go through, so there's
nothing to really compare it to. . . . I wish things would have
worked out differently, but given the circumstances, the cards I
was dealt, I thought I did a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Lakers mull that decision, the clock is ticking for
sharpshooter Glen Rice. The Lakers have until July 1 to either
exercise a $7.1 million one-year option or give Rice the
multimillion-dollar extension he wants. If they take no action,
he'll join a long list of Lakers free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Starters Derek Fisher and J.R. Reid and reserves Rick Fox and
Ruben Patterson are free agents as of July 1. And Derek Harper, a
part-time starter, might retire.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the small matter of Shaquille O'Neal's option to
terminate the remaining four years of his contract. Opting out
would mean sacrificing millions because of the league's new labor
deal, but O'Neal has stopped short of guaranteeing he'll return.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he dodged the issue entirely by skipping the
postseason team meeting _ as he's done every season here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to win and he'll do it at all costs,'' said Fisher,
who thinks O'Neal will be back. ``He doesn't have any financial
concerns. Whatever decision he makes, it will be about winning a
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and Fox want to return. Reid is noncommittal. Harper is
taking a wait-and-see approach. And Rice, frustrated over his role
in the offense, nevertheless wants to be a Laker for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers don't trade Rice, and O'Neal stays, they will
again form a dangerous, if volatile, core with Kobe Bryant on a
team that will again be favored to contend for a title. And maybe
all the Lakers really need is not a wholesale makeover but a real
training camp and full 82-game schedule to become a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have the pieces,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a terrible basketball team,'' West admonished.
``We have a talented basketball team here, and we're competing
against our past success. . . . We lost in four straight games to a
team with the best record this year. And those are the things that
we will be remembered for, but I will tell you this is a pretty
darn good team. If we can retain the parts that we want to retain
and maybe add a couple players that will provide us a little bit
different look on our bench, we think we're very, very
competitive.''

O'NEAL PUTS THE `ME' INTO LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ L.A. is a nice place to clinch a Western
Conference Finals berth. But San Antonio forward Sean Elliott
wouldn't want to play here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of individualism, a lot of `Me,' '' Elliott said
after the Spurs' Western Conference semifinal series-clinching win
over the Lakers Sunday at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott was talking about the city, but he could have been
describing the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille ``I've got this team just the way I want it'' O'Neal.
Kobe ``I've never seen a double team I didn't think I could score
on'' Bryant. Glen ``I need plays called for me'' Rice. They're as
L.A. as oxygen bars, road rage and plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is the team captain, but for the second year in a row he
couldn't be bothered to attend the Lakers' morning-after team
meeting. Maybe he ran into a scheduling conflict with Billy Blanks'
Tae-Bo class and couldn't get from Sherman Oaks to Inglewood in
time.
</P>
<P>
   The players who did come to clear out their lockers Monday made
a big deal of saying it was no big deal that O'Neal was a no-show
at the last official team gathering. But of course. They're inured
to O'Neal's ways by now. They know that if they don't expect too
much from him, they might not be let down.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal ought to have been there, if only to say his so-longs to
players who've had his back who might not be  &UR; !ital! &LR; coming back.
Guys like Rice, J.R. Reid, Derek Fisher, Derek Harper, Rick Fox and
Ruben Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   They deserved a few nice parting words from their leader. But
who's going to explain that to Shaq? He pays people good money to
shield him from potentially unpleasant confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal refers to the Lakers as if it's just another one of his
possessions, like a seventh car or a second child. ``My guys played
hard,'' he said after the Lakers' 118-107 loss to the Spurs in
Sunday's deciding Game 4 of the Spurs' series.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' downfall this season, O'Neal said, was ``we never
learned to play together, play smart.''
</P>
<P>
   How keen of him to recognize it. Of course, that's the easy
part. The hard part is rectifying it.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott was right, it  &UR; !ital! &LR; is hard playing professional team
sports in L.A. (If it were easy, the city surely wouldn't be in the
midst of an 11-year championship drought.)
</P>
<P>
   Never mind all the deep tans and shallow mores, there's the
sheer geography of L.A. working against the teams. The city is so
spread out, it can swallow the players if they aren't careful. A
Laker could live in Pacific Palisades or Century City or Marina del
Rey or Manhattan Beach, practice in L.A. and play in Inglewood.
With that kind of spacing, a team's offense is bound to suffer. Its
defense, too.
</P>
<P>
   With players fanning out after practices and games, it's hard to
get tight. Show us players who car-pool to practice and share the
occasional meal afterward and we'll show you a team with
camaraderie and chemistry. There's nothing like a little bonding
off the court to bring players closer on it.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal wasn't seeing the cement for the sidewalk earlier this
season when he said, ``We don't have to go to the movies together,
eat dinner together and do all that. . . . When we're on the court
. . . everybody just has to do their part, period, whether we like
each other or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But had they done more things together, who knows? They just
might have found themselves growing fond of one another in spite of
themselves. It takes a bond to raise a championship banner. And
we're not talking about simply a shared wish and a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But don't take our word for it. Listen to Lakers forward Robert
Horry, who was part of two NBA championships in Houston. Horry
said, ``The biggest thing in basketball is learning your fellow
man.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, wouldn't it be great to see O'Neal invite his
teammates _ whoever they end up being _ over to his crib for a
barbecue some day right after training camp breaks in the fall?
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be a step in the right direction if Bryant, instead
of shooting baskets for 90 minutes by himself after practice,
occasionally left the floor with his teammates and asked them if
they'd like to grab lunch, on him?
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers could win 34 of 57 games this year, imagine the
success they might have if they learned to really respect _ even
genuinely like _ one another. You don't need to imagine it. Just
look at San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys here are out for a common goal,'' Elliott said. ``Guys
aren't putting themselves first.''
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, so does this:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk about whose team this is,'' said Spurs
guard Mario Elie. ``It's our team.''

CASE ENDS NOT WITH A BANG, BUT A WHISPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-LOUIMA-VOLPE, NY-LOUIMA-ASSESS) 
(mk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sign of an end to a case alleging singular police
brutality came quietly late Monday afternoon, in a courtroom
whisper.
</P>
<P>
   But the whispers begot exclamations by nightfall, as many in the
city learned that Police Officer Justin Volpe planned to admit
Tuesday that he tortured a Haitian immigrant in a Brooklyn precinct
station house two summers ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and other city and police officials
declined to comment Monday night, saying that they would wait until
the burly officer officially entered his plea. And most of the
officers walking in and out of the 70th Precinct station house in
Brooklyn brushed aside questions about their colleague, whose
alleged brutality of Abner Louima had turned their workplace into a
symbol of the abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Brooklyn church where Louima worships, several
congregants spoke softly but firmly of justice done, and of their
hope that something good and lasting comes from the harm done to
their brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked for justice, we found justice,'' said Gastona
Morette, 48, who works as a cook in a nursing home. ``And now
everybody can enjoy it. This is not only for the Haitian people,
this is for all the people of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Marvyn Kornberg, the usually voluble lawyer for Volpe,
who whispered the words that caused the evening ripples. At a
sidebar conference out of the earshot of courtroom spectators,
Kornberg told federal prosecutors and Judge Eugene Nickerson in
federal court in Brooklyn that his client ``would like to enter a
plea tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Although delivered in the formal language of the law, Kornberg's
words referred to a case of grotesque allegations, including that
Volpe had shoved a stick up Louima's rectum, rupturing vital
organs, while another officer held him down in a station house
bathroom. It attracted international attention, and transformed two
men into public figures: Louima, a black man so thin that the suits
he wore to the trial hung loose on his body, and Volpe, a white man
with the body of a weightlifter and the strut of a man who felt
wrongfully accused.
</P>
<P>
   After the sidebar conference, Kornberg and Volpe left the court
building and strode away under pallid skies, returning reporters'
questions with volleys of ``no comment.'' But minutes later, just
as those skies let loose a thunderous rain, the intentions of the
accused police officer became known.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Osborne, a video producer hurrying past Cadman Plaza
Park, savored both the shelter of his umbrella and the news. ``I
would have been surprised'' by a guilty plea three weeks ago, he
said, given the self-assuredness of Kornberg, who at that time was
suggesting that Louima, a heterosexual, had suffered his injuries
by having sex with another man on the night of his August 1997
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, several officers from the 70th Precinct have
provided devastating testimony against Volpe, he said, and the
officer's guilt became increasingly obvious. But Osborne, who is
black, said that he thinks Volpe was spurred to violence not by
racism but by a ferocious rage, tapped by a punch the officer
supposedly received outside a Brooklyn nightclub on the night of
the attack on Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers are supposed to be trained for such encounters,
Osborne said. ``To somehow take it personally ...'' He did not
finish the thought.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Officer Rafael Collazo of the Latino Officers
Association finished the thought for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming this plea is made, it sends a strong statement that
the department may have officers who are possible loose cannons on
this job,'' Collazo said. ``The vast majority are good,
hard-working officers. But the fact that Volpe will admit to such a
heinous crime sends a message that the department should
re-evaluate problem officers on this job and do more to root them
out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton held a news conference Monday night at his
Harlem headquarters to praise the officers who testified against
Volpe _ ``They have given policing a good name in this city'' _ and
to decry what he called Kornberg's ``homophobic defense.'' He also
said: ``I'm very happy for Abner and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was joy over the news at Louima's church, it was muted,
almost respectful. Congregants of the Evangelical Crusade of
Fishers of Men came Monday night to celebrate the church's 26th
anniversary, but several acknowledged that they had heard ``the
good news'' through radio and television reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not surprised,'' said Pastor Phillius Nicolas. ``We
believe in God, and we knew that no matter how they tried to hide
the truth, the truth would come out. And it came.''
</P>
<P>
   The pastor and others said that they felt vindicated by the
news, and they expressed hope that it would teach police a lesson
in respect. But Nicolas also said that the city's Haitians should
also draw a lesson from the story of Abner Louima. ``It should
teach people that no one is going to give you your rights,'' he
said. ``You have to claim them.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the congregation said that no portion of Monday
night's service would be set aside to celebrate the news. Instead,
they said, they would thank God in prayer and song.

FIRST LADY RAISES MONEY FOR CANDIDATE WHO MAY STEP ASIDE FOR HER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid new indications that she is preparing to move to
New York to run for the United States Senate, Hillary Rodham
Clinton returned to Manhattan Monday night as the featured speaker
at a political fund-raiser for Representative Nita D. Lowey _ the
Westchester Democrat who is hoping that Mrs. Clinton does not run,
so that she can.
</P>
<P>
   Even for a year that is turning out to be one of the more
politically convoluted in recent New York history, Mrs. Clinton's
appearance at Mrs. Lowey's $1,000-a-head fund-raiser was an odd
event. The First Lady helped the 61-year-old Westchester Democrat
raise $1 million for a potential race for the Senate, a race that
Mrs. Lowey said she would forgo if Mrs. Clinton decided to seek the
seat herself. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan is retiring at the
end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mrs. Lowey's aides acknowledge that it is increasingly
likely that Mrs. clinton will decide to run. The First Lady has
instructed representatives to begin looking for a home for her and
President Clinton in Westchester, according to a report that will
appear in The New York Times Magazine on Sunday. And Mrs. Clinton
told the CBS anchorman Dan Rather, in an interview scheduled to be
broadcast on ``60 Minutes II'' Wednesday night, that she planned
``to live in New York no matter what I end up doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, in the course of her remarks to a hotel ballroom
bustling with Democrats and television crews, did not allude to the
topic that had most of the tables buzzing. Instead, she offered an
effusive testimonial to Mrs. Lowey's record in Congress and never
once mentioned Mrs. Lowey's Senate ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Mrs. Lowey _ who has said she would run for a sixth
term in the House if Mrs. Clinton runs for the Senate _ made
humorous reference to their situation, and then noted the unusual
fact that it is state Republicans, rather than Democrats, who are
feuding these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the Republicans in this state turn their backs on one
another, I am proud to march forward shoulder to shoulder with my
friend, Hillary Rodham Clinton,'' Mrs. Lowey said. ``We are united
_ and we are confident that on Nov. 7, 2000, New York will elect
its first woman to the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Mrs. Clinton's ninth visit to the state this year, and
inevitably reinforced a belief among Democrats here and in
Washington that in the end she will run for the seat that Mrs.
Lowey would like.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has told friends that she is likely to form an
exploratory committee _ it would be the first step toward running _
but has yet to make a final decision about actually running.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said before that he and Mrs. Clinton, who
are expected to set up more than one residence after his term
expires, would like to live in New York. Mrs. Clinton's friends
told The Times Magazine that her representatives were looking at
potential locations in Westchester, raising the prospect that Mrs.
Clinton could have Mrs. Lowey as her congresswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing places to live after the White House, the Clintons
are known to be considering both security and proximity to golf
courses, which is presumably what nudged Mrs. Clinton to look north
of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's itinerary Monday allowed her to attend to both
New York and national political concerns. She showed up at a book
party for Matilda Raffa Cuomo, the wife of Mario M. Cuomo, at Le
Cirque 2000. She attended an awards dinner sponsored by Americans
for the Arts at Lincoln Center, and she also appeared at a
closed-door fund-raiser for the Democratic Senate Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser for Mrs. Lowey, she praised the
representative's record on abortion rights and gun control, among
other issues. ``With Nita it is not about back-room deals or how
many special interests you can satisfy,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``It's
really about whether or not she can make a contribution to the
well-being of her constituents and her state and her country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, Marsha Berry, said that because
about half of what Mrs. Clinton did Monday was considered official
business, half the cost of the trip was billed to the White House
and the rest would be billed to the political committees that
benefited from her appearances.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons that Mrs. Clinton is moving to forming an
exploratory committee is that she has come under increasing
criticism for making trips to New York at White House expense; an
exploratory committee would allow her to raise money to finance the
trips.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Lowey was at all annoyed about how Mrs. Clinton's
political ambitions were overcoming her own, she and her aides did
not show it last night.
</P>
<P>
   The representative matched Mrs. Clinton, compliment for
compliment. Her press secretary, Howard Wolfson, smiled gamely when
he learned that the First Lady might be house-shopping in his boss'
district
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be absolutely delighted to welcome the First Lady to
Westchester,'' Wolfson said.  &QL;
