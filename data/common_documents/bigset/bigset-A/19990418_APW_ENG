<HEADLINE> Sponsor Drops $30M Olympics Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Johnson &AMP; Johnson became the first sponsor  
to pull out of the scandal-ridden Olympics, backing off an 
estimated $30 million deal for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The company today blamed the decision on internal disagreements  
about how to link the company's many brands under a sponsorship 
umbrella in time for the Salt Lake City Games. But Olympic bribery 
was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't say that it didn't have anything to do with it,''  
company spokesman John McKeegan said. ``It was certainly in the 
background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake scandal sparked several investigations after it  
was revealed the city's bid committee offered $1.2 million in cash, 
scholarships and other gifts to International Olympic Committee 
members and their relatives during the successful campaign to win 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members have been removed or have resigned after being  
linked to the cash payments and other vote-buying inducements. Ten 
others have been censured or warned about their actions in the 
worst ethics scandal in the history of the modern Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson, a health care product company in New  
Brunswick, N.J., had just signed a letter of intent to increase 
financial support when the bribery accusations surfaced late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors that we talk to are assessing the environment in  
which we find ourselves every single day,'' said John Krimsky, 
deputy secretary general of the U.S. Olympic Committee and the 
games' chief fund-raising officer. ``And when they have to invest 
millions of dollars and the reputation of their products and 
services they have to be very, very careful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Johnson &AMP; Johnson has never been a full sponsor for the  
games, it has provided its products to athletes through the USOC 
for about 20 years. McKeegan said that relationship would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky said the company pulled back in January or February,  
before Olympic organizations finished investigating and 
implementing reforms. And he added that the door is still open for 
an agreement for 2002 because company officials have since met with 
Salt Lake Organizing Committee head Mitt Romney. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake already has commitments for more support than Atlanta  
had by the time it staged its more expensive 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the revelation that Salt Lake bid executives wooed IOC  
members with bribes, no new sponsors have signed on. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky's marketing project, Olympic Properties of the United  
States, still needs to raise about $300 million in cash, goods and 
services to meet SLOC's $1.45 billion budget.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Today is Monday, April 19, the 109th day of 1999. There are 256  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On April 19, 1951, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, relieved of his  
command by President Truman, bid farewell to Congress, quoting a 
line from a ballad: ``Old soldiers never die; they just fade 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1775, the American Revolutionary War began with the battles  
of Lexington and Concord. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1897, the first Boston Marathon was run from Ashland, Mass.,  
to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1898, Congress passed a resolution recognizing Cuban  
independence and demanding that Spain relinquish its authority over 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1933, the United States went off the gold standard.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1943, during World War II, tens of thousands of Jews living  
in the Warsaw Ghetto began a valiant but futile battle against Nazi 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ``Carousel'' opened  
on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, astronauts Sally K. Ride and Guion S. Bluford Jr.  
became the first woman and first African-American to be tapped for 
U.S. space missions. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the 51-day siege at the Branch Davidian compound near  
Waco, Texas, ended as fire destroyed the structure after federal 
agents began smashing their way in; dozens of people, including 
David Koresh, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a truck bomb devastated the Alfred P. Murrah Federal  
Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people. Timothy McVeigh and 
Terry Nichols were later convicted of charges related to the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: Forty-seven sailors were killed when a gun turret  
exploded aboard the USS Iowa. A female jogger in New York's Central 
Park was brutally beaten and raped. Six teen-agers were later 
charged in the near-fatal attack; five were convicted, one pleaded 
guilty to a lesser charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: A Los Angeles jury awarded $3.8 million to  
beaten motorist Rodney King. The Supreme Court outlawed the 
practice of excluding people from juries because of their gender. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: Wang Dan, a leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square  
pro-democracy protests, arrived in the United States after being 
freed by China. It was announced that Linda McCartney, the wife of 
Paul McCartney, had died two days earlier at age 56. Mexican 
poet-philosopher Octavio Paz died at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Birthdays: Actor Hugh O'Brian is 74. Actor Don Adams is  
73. Actor-comedian Dudley Moore is 64. Actress Elinor Donahue is 
62. Actor Tim Curry is 53. Pop singer Mark ``Flo'' Volman (The 
Turtles; Flo and Eddie) is 52. Tennis player Sue Barker is 43. 
Actress Ashley Judd is 31. Pop singer Bekka Bramlett is 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Thought for Today: ``Never one thing and seldom one person can  
make for a success. It takes a number of them merging into one 
perfect whole.''-- Marie Dressler, Canadian actress (1869-1934).

	NATO Steps Up Air War on Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO today launched its most active  
day of airstrikes in its assault on Yugoslavia, pummeling 
refineries, bridges and dozens of other targets in what it claimed 
were ``highly successful'' operations. But the refugee crisis only 
deepened with ethnic Albanians pouring out of Kosovo at the rate of 
a thousand an hour. In the latest tragedy, a car carrying a family 
across the border to Albania struck a land mine planted by Serb 
forces, killing three children, their mother and their grandmother. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S.: Kosovo Dead May Total 100,000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tens of thousands of young ethnic Albanian men  
-- possibly as many as 100,000 -- may have been killed by Serb ethnic 
cleansing of Kosovo, the U.S. ambassador for war crimes said today. 
David Scheffer also said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
``certainly (is) a prime target for investigation'' as a war 
criminal. Scheffer, appearing on Fox News, brought side-by-side 
photographs of the town of Izbica that he said proved mass killings 
by Serbs. The photos depicted an area taken at different times. In 
the photo on the right, up to 150 graves had appeared where nothing 
existed before.

	Abortion Foes Open Buffalo Protests  
</P>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Activists on both sides of the abortion  
issue noisily clashed on the steps of a federal courthouse today, 
the first day of a week-long campaign by abortion foes. Protesters 
participating in Operation Save America will denounce abortion, 
child pornography and teen sex. Abortion rights activists have 
condemned the timing and choice of location for the Operation 
Rescue campaign. The demonstrations were announced a week after 
last October's sniper killing of abortion provider Dr. Barnett 
Slepian inside his home in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst.

	Miami-Area Fire Burns 70,000 Acres  
</P>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A fire burned out of control in the  
Everglades today, consuming 70,000 acres and creating clouds of 
smoke that darkened the Miami area. The fire came within 100 yards 
of Interstate 75, closing the main coast-to-coast route across 
south Florida. The fire began on the Everglades' western edge 
yesterday, possibly ignited by heat from a vehicle's catalytic 
converter.

	Relatives To Mark Oklahoma Bombing  
</P>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Relatives of some of the Murrah Federal  
Building bombing victims will gather tomorrow to observe the fourth 
anniversary of the disaster, their last such observance before a 
permanent memorial park is completed next year. A feature of the 
park will be the Survivor Tree, an elm that survived the blast that 
killed 168 people. A museum that is projected to open in 2000, and 
offices for the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism 
also will be built.

	N. Irish Militants Urged To Disarm  
</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's top  
Protestant politician appealed to the province's major outlawed 
pro-British groups to hand in weapons as the best way to force the 
IRA to do the same. David Trimble, elected last year to lead 
Northern Ireland's still-unformed Protestant-Catholic government, 
made the appeal on the eve of renewed talks in London. Like their 
enemies in the Irish Republican Army, the Ulster Defense 
Association and Ulster Volunteer Force have been observing 
cease-fires but have refused to start disarming.

<P>
	Compaq President, CFO Both Resign  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Without notice and with little explanation,  
Compaq Computer Corp. president and CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer resigned 
today. Compaq's chief financial officer also stepped down. The 
company's board formed an interim chief executive's office to 
handle day-to-day operations of the world's largest supplier of 
computer systems. The company has been under tremendous pressure 
from stockholders since an April 9 announcement that its 
first-quarter earnings would be lower than expected.

	'Great' Gretzky Ends NHL Career  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky ended his NHL career today to the  
rousing cheers and endless chants from an overflow crowd at Madison 
Square Garden. Gretzky ended his career with an assist, setting up 
a second-period goal as his New York Rangers fell to Pittsburgh 2-1 
in overtime. After the game, Gretzky skated one lap around the rink 
with his teammates in tow, then came an encore, as a lone spotlight 
followed him around the ice and Carly Simon's ``Nobody Does It 
Better'' blared.

<P>
	Cubs Edge Brewers 6-5  
</P>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jose Hernandez hit a home run leading off the  
10th inning today, lifting the Chicago Cubs over the Milwaukee 
Brewers 6-5. Sammy Sosa's double set up pinch-hitter Manny 
Alexander's two-out, two-run double in the ninth, giving the Cubs a 
5-3 lead. The Brewers tied it in the bottom half on RBI singles by 
Fernando Vina and Marquis Grissom. Hernandez then connected off 
Valerio De Los Santos (0-1).

<HEADLINE> Jones Cruises To 400 Meters Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALNUT, Calif. (AP) -- Marion Jones, who plans to go for four  
gold medals in this summer's World Championships and five in the 
2000 Olympics, cruised to an easy 400-meter victory Sunday in the 
Mt. SAC Relays. 
</P>
<P>
	In a family sweep, C.J. Hunter, Jones' husband, upset world  
champion and No. 1-ranked John Godina in the shot put. 
</P>
<P>
	Not long after Hunter had unleashed a lifetime best throw of 70  
feet, 3 inches, to win his event on the Mt. San Antonio College 
infield, Jones won the 400 with a time of 50.79 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, ranked tops in the world last year in the 100, 200 and  
long jump, competes in the 400 mostly for training purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my last open 400-meter race of the year, but I hope to  
be selected for the U.S. 1600-meter relay team for the World 
Championships in Spain this August,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't run a personal best today, but I'm still happy with  
my time. I was hoping to run below 50 seconds because this is a 
homecoming meet for me. It's my only race in Southern California 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeming to glide along effortlessly, Jones quickly moved in  
front and widened her lead to 30 yards with 100 yards to go. But, 
clearly in control, she slowed noticeably in the final strides, 
still winning easily but with a pedestrian -- for her -- time. 
</P>
<P>
	LaDonna Antoine of Canada finished a distant second in 52.94.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones lost just once in 35 finals last year, her only defeat  
coming in the World Cup long jump won by Germany's Heike Drechsler. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones hopes to compete in both sprints, the long jump and a  
relay in Spain, and hopes to add another relay for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if I can stay healthy, I think I have a chance at five  
events in the Sydney Olympics,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ato Boldon, whose 100-meter winning time of 9.86 last year at  
the Relays turned out to be 1998's fastest time in the world, came 
back to win the 200 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, a native of Trinidad and a former NCAA champion at UCLA,  
eased in front coming out of the turn and went on to win in 20.19. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal for 1999 is the gold medal in the 100 at the World  
Championships,'' Boldon said. ``I want to win two gold medals in 
the sprints in Sydney and if I succeed, maybe just one more World 
Championships and then call it a career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Boldon, who finished third in both sprints in  
the 1996 Olympics, added, ``If I had won gold in Atlanta, I'd be 
out of the sport now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Greene, the world No. 1 in the 100 last year, was  
scheduled to run in the event at Mt. SAC, but did not because of a 
slight leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Derrick Adkins, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the 400  
hurdles who had a forgettable year in 1998, looked sharp again in 
winning his speciality with a 48.71 clocking. 
</P>
<P>
	Another former Olympic gold medal winner in the 400 hurdles,  
Barcelona champion Kevin Young, finished seventh in 50.60.

<HEADLINE> Tough Game Bids Gretzky Goodbye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Six-year-old Trevor Gretzky skipped his Little  
League game to see the old man off after all. Michael Jordan called 
around breakfast time. People making their way toward Madison 
Square Garden wearing Rangers jerseys with ``99'' stitched on the 
back, crossed against the light in sun-dappled Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody said goodbye to Wayne Gretzky in their own way Sunday,  
none more gracefully than the game with a tough reputation and the 
town with an even tougher one. 
</P>
<P>
	National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman did so by  
retiring his number. Teammates gave him a large-screen TV. The 
Rangers gave him a Mercedes-Benz. The P.A. system played every 
mushy song ever recorded. The crowd of 18,200 stood as one nearly 
every time the puck turned up on the blade of his stick. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody came bearing gifts for The Great One it seemed, except  
the Pittsburgh Penguins. And even the villains in the 1,487th and 
final game of Gretzky's career were helpless to stop him from 
picking up assist No. 1,963 on a nifty backhand pass that led to 
the Rangers' only goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins did win a measure of revenge -- and a place in the  
trivia trove of hockey -- with a 2-1 victory on a goal by Jaromir 
Jagr in overtime. ``Jagr said to me he didn't mean do it,'' Gretzky 
said afterward. ``That's what I used to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even that couldn't take the luster off his day.  
</P>
<P>
	The puck had barely rippled the chords of the Rangers' net when  
Jagr, heir apparent to Gretzky's crown as the best in the game, led 
his teammates in forming a receiving line to shake The Great One's 
hand. Countless hugs, three curtain calls and several tearful laps 
of the arena later, Gretzky left hockey the way he came in -- with 
his head held high and the right side of his jersey still tucked 
into the corner of his pants. 
</P>
<P>
	That bit of tailoring was a habit born of necessity, the only  
way a scrawny kid routinely playing in leagues against kids four 
and five years older could keep the too-big jerseys he always wore 
from getting in his way. What changed between then and now is that 
when he stepped off the rink, he was four and five years older than 
everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only am I mentally ready to retire, I'm physically ready  
to retire, too,'' Gretzky said. ``This is a great game, but it's a 
hard game, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no way to know that watching him play, even this last  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game the Rangers painted ``99'' on the ice between  
the nets and the backboards on both ends in recognition of the 
space Gretzky called his ``office'' -- the place where he dished out 
literally hundreds of assists. On his third shift of the opening 
period, he set up shop there and two Penguins, defenseman Kevin 
Hatcher and right wing Alexei Kovalev, materialized on either side 
of the net, hoping to hem Gretzky in. 
</P>
<P>
	He began dribbling the puck, backhand then forehand, keeping it  
tantalizingly out of the reach of both players. Neither dared lunge 
at him, maybe because they had seen the same replays the rest of us 
had hundreds of times: Gretzky threading a lethal pass through the 
narrowest of openings; Gretzky delicately flipping the puck over 
the net, off the back of the goalkeeper, and into the net; Gretzky 
spotting an onrushing teammate and caroming the puck off the corner 
boards, the way a pool hustler might. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins, as it turned out, dodged the bullet that time and  
on another dozen opportunities like it. Gretzky kept setting up 
teammates; they kept failing to finish. But every time he did so 
was one more bit of proof that the game really does slow down for 
the great ones, that they know not just where everything would 
happen, but where it would happen next. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that surprised Gretzky all afternoon happened  
with 30 seconds left in the game. John Muckler, the Ranger coach 
who had been an assistant when Gretzky broke in with the Edmonton 
Oilers some 15 years ago, called a timeout with the score tied 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``John's got a daughter that's about to give birth in Edmonton  
... and he said, `I've got to tell you something. I just had a 
grandson today. And now you got to get the winner,''' Gretzky 
recalled. ``And maybe when I was younger, I might have got it for 
him. I didn't today, so maybe that's why it's the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the right time, but not because of that.  
</P>
<P>
	It was right because Gretzky walked into the Garden this morning  
accompanied by the father who taught him the responsibility that 
came with having a gift, and he walked out hours later with his 
wife, his daughter and two sons of his own, old enough now to 
understand that their father had been equal to the task. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days before he announced his retirement, Gretzky asked  
Trevor whether he planned to be on hand for Sunday's game. The 
6-year-old said, no, he had a Little League game scheduled and he 
wanted to be there instead. 
</P>
<P>
	And so just this once, Trevor's old man did something he never  
did. He asked for special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a practice yesterday and we talked to the team,  
changed things around a little bit. I guess,'' Wayne Gretzky said, 
``I had that much pull.''

<HEADLINE> N.Y. To Require Beehive Inspections / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Beehives being brought into New York this  
spring must be inspected for a South African beetle that is blamed 
for ruining thousands of hives in four Southern states. 
</P>
<P>
	The small hive beetle made its first known appearance in the  
Western Hemisphere on June 5, 1998, in hives in St. Lucie County, 
Fla. It has since been reported in Georgia, North Carolina and 
South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's acting agriculture commissioner, Nathan Rudgers, said  
the beetle thrives in humid, tropical climates. It is uncertain 
whether the beetle would become dormant in colder northern 
climates, but ``we're not going to take any chances,'' Rudgers said 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Agriculture and Markets is requiring  
that all beehives brought into New York be inspected for the 
beetle. The keepers of migratory bees in New York often transport 
their hives in the winter to Southern states, mainly Florida, and 
then take them back north in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The state already requires hives bound for New York to be  
inspected for several pests, chiefly Varroa mites and trachial 
mites, said agriculture department spokesman Pete Gregg. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Doan of Doan's Honey Farm in Hamlin, 15 miles northwest of  
Rochester, said he has had his bees trucked to Florida for the 
winter after nearly losing his operation to Varroa mites three 
years ago. While initially very concerned about small hive beetles, 
he said he has become less so as more has become known about the 
pests. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports that the beetles alone were responsible for ruining  
hives don't appear to tell the whole story, Doan said. Many of 
those hives appear to first have been weakened by mites and then 
destroyed by the beetles, he said. That seems to make the beetles 
like wax worms, who become a threat only when the health of hives 
has become compromised. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear what effect the colder temperatures of New York  
would have on the beetles, said Doan, who has about 3,000 hives of 
honey bees. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is just not enough known about small hive beetles,'' he  
said. ``They should not be able to winter in the ground here, but 
that doesn't mean that they couldn't go up and winter in the 
hives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honey production is estimated as a $5 million industry in New  
York, and there are about 72,000 colonies of bees in the state. 
Bees are also used to pollinate certain crops on farms in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The beetles, which may have come to this country in soil from  
South Africa, like to eat honey and pollen and lay eggs in the 
honeycomb cells. Their larvae burrow into the combs of hives, 
causing the honey to ferment and forcing adult bees to abandon the 
combs. Beetles in the larval stage are the most damaging to hives, 
Doan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The beetles' hard, shiny black shells guard against the bees'  
stingers.

<HEADLINE> Concert Promoter Avram Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Concert promoter Marcel Avram is out of  
prison and back at work, planning two shows on the cusp of the 
millennium for his biggest client, Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Avram was released this month after serving two years for tax  
evasion. He was quoted by Focus newsmagazine as saying Jackson 
intends to give a concert Dec. 31 in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the show we'll fly to Honolulu and play again on  
December 31, because of the 22-hour time difference,'' he told the 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romanian-born Avram, whose client list also has included  
Pink Floyd and Joe Cocker, was convicted in 1997 of dodging tax 
payments of nearly $2.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Homeowners Flee Airport Noise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Pat Philpott has lived in the same home  
for more than three decades. Naturally, she felt anxious when she 
learned she would have to move to make room for an airport's 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	That was until she found out she could take everything with her:  
her sofa, her television, her antique dresser -- and all her 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Philpott, 58, is among nearly 300 homeowners in Minor Lane  
Heights who over the next several years will pack up and move about 
8 miles to the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	It's part of an ambitious relocation plan that will keep their  
tiny incorporated community of about 1,700 residents at the 
southern edge of suburban Louisville from being dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``This community does a lot of things together -- Easter egg  
hunts, senior citizen dinners, picnics and festivals,'' Minor Lane 
Heights Mayor Fred Williams said. ``Why let go of all of that if 
you don't have to?'' 
</P>
<P>
	On one side of Mrs. Philpott's new home will be the family she's  
lived beside for nearly 30 years. On the other side will be a woman 
who's lived across the street for 26 years. Other current neighbors 
will be across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, I didn't want to move, not at all,'' Mrs. Philpott  
said. ``I've lived here a long time and raised my sons here and 
made some great friends. I didn't want to give all that up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither did many other residents, who banded together to make  
sure long-standing relationships would not be razed in the same 
fashion as their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lived here for 14 years and my parents live right next  
door,'' said 43-year-old Gerald Jackson, who along with his wife 
and two children will be among the first 50 families to have moved 
into their new homes by Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody here looks out for each other like family. I  
couldn't imagine relocating anywhere away from a lot of these 
people, especially my folks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A groundbreaking ceremony for the new community was held March  
28, but the process began more than five years ago when Louisville 
International Airport announced plans to open two new runways. That 
sparked outcries that the added noise would further burden 
thousands of already frazzled homeowners below the airport's flight 
path. 
</P>
<P>
	``From about 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., the roar is constant,'' Williams  
said. ``But it's not just the noise. The airport here has a great 
track record, but what goes up must come down. Eventually, there's 
going to be some kind of disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A solution was proposed: a $285 million federal and state grant  
program to buy out more than 3,700 area property owners so they 
could purchase homes in other locations. 
</P>
<P>
	To those who had lived in Minor Lane Heights for years, however,  
that wasn't good enough. They told airport officials they would 
agree to move on the condition that residents could move together. 
</P>
<P>
	``When this whole situation came up about five years ago, the  
phones were ringing off the hook with people asking, `Where am I 
going to go?' and `What am I going to do,''' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone proposed the idea of moving together. Right away,  
people started saying it couldn't be done. But our attitude was 
`Why not?' These days, you can do just about anything you want if 
you put your mind to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents have taken the buyout money and moved elsewhere.  
But most, about 300 of 440 homeowners, have chosen to relocate to 
the new city, called Heritage Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is tickled to death with this,'' said city Clerk Jan  
Skeeters. ``And the excitement really picked up when people started 
picking their lots. Even though they just see their names on a 
colored dot on a layout board, it's become reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration spends millions of dollars  
annually to help people living near airports cope with the 
unsettling problem of jet noise, soundproofing some houses and 
buying and tearing down others. The budget for the program was $200 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In this situation, the agency and the airport each chipped in  
$10 million to help purchase 287 acres of land at the new site. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents will be able to sell their property to the program to  
buy land in the new community, where they will move into a home 
comparable to the one they sold. 
</P>
<P>
	About 350 houses will be built in the first phase of  
construction with more planned over the next several years. 
Williams said the three-bedroom, one-bath homes will average about 
1,000 square feet, although residents will be allowed to pay more 
for larger lots or amenities their current homes lack. 
</P>
<P>
	The new city hall will be a 100-year-old building already on the  
property, which officials plan to begin renovating as soon as the 
first residents move into their new homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few people have asked me about the downside to this  
situation,'' Skeeters said. ``Other than the fact they've got a lot 
of fond memories in those old houses, what possible downside is 
there?''

<HEADLINE> 'Great' Gretzky Plays Last NHL Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky, as classy as ever in his final  
game, bid a tearful farewell today to adoring fans and teammates -- 
and took with him forever his famed No. 99. 
</P>
<P>
	But not before he added to his record-setting points total with  
a second-period assist. 
</P>
<P>
	During a rousing pregame celebration filled with chants,  
ovations and rhythmic clapping, Gretzky was told by NHL 
commissioner Gary Bettman that no one in the league will wear the 
number again. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the first of several times Gretzky became teary. It  
happened again when his father, Walter, was driven to center ice in 
a new black Mercedes presented to Gretzky as a parting gift. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel so lucky to be able to play in the NHL,'' the sport's  
greatest player said. ``I've been so fortunate to play with some of 
the greatest players, against guys I admired so much, like the best 
player I ever played against Mario Lemieux ... my teammates and, of 
course, the best player I ever played with, Mark Messier. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it would be nothing without family and the great  
friendships I have developed over the years. I appreciate all the 
accolades. I tell everyone the greatest place to play is right here 
in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who announced his retirement Friday, wore a huge grin  
as friend Bryan Adams sang ``O, Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss you, Wayne,'' Adams ad-libbed late in the  
song. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star-Spangled Banner,'' as sung by John Amirante, was  
altered to include the words ``in the land of Wayne Gretzky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who holds or shares 61 NHL records, opened the game  
facing off against the Pittsburgh Penguins' Martin Straka, and won 
the faceoff, naturally. Otherwise, the shift was uneventful. 
</P>
<P>
	So was the first period, although Gretzky set up Brian Leetch,  
John MacLean and Niklas Sundstrom for scoring chances. All failed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first television timeout, Gordie Howe -- whose records  
Gretzky regularly broke -- appeared in a video, saluting his 
prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sports king, Michael Jordan, appeared in a second-period  
video, telling Gretzky, ``Your golf game is not going to get 
better, so don't think that will help. It will probably get worse, 
because you've got more time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, Gretzky set up MacLean for a semi-breakaway, but  
Tom Barrasso stopped a slap shot. Then Gretzky broke in on a 2-on-1 
with MacLean, who held the puck too long for a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the Rangers were able to convert Gretzky's magic into a  
goal. On a power play while trailing 1-0, Gretzky passed from the 
right-wing boards to Mathieu Schneider in the slot. He faked a shot 
and passed to Leetch for a tap-in, open-net goal. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to a mob scene at the sideboards as his teammates  
hugged, although Gretzky didn't seem very emotional. Of course, 
he'd done this 2,856 times before in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	The first ovation, when Gretzky was introduced by master of  
ceremonies John Davidson, was accompanied by chants from the 
Madison Square Garden crowd of ``Gretz-ky, Gretz-ky'' and a 
three-minute salute that seemed to make the man of honor almost 
uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he skated to the Penguins bench and shared hugs and  
handshakes with several players as the rhythmic applause continued. 
He even pointed to the crowd at banners that said ``Thanks for the 
Memories,'' ``Always in Our Hearts: No. 99'' and ``Gretzky the 
Greatest Forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his family standing at center ice, along with teammates  
Leetch, Adam Graves and Jeff Beukeboom, Edmonton Oilers president 
Glen Sather was introduced. Gretzky shared a hug with his first pro 
coach, and then did the same with Lemieux, who retired in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, Canada's greatest sports hero, left Edmonton in 1988,  
tears streaming down his cheeks after a trade to Los Angeles. He 
said goodbye to Hollywood in 1996, dealt to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came to the Rangers -- already hockey's biggest hero  
everywhere else -- he rejoined Messier, who was New York's leader 
and had helped the team win its first Stanley Cup in 54 years. When 
Gretzky left Sunday, Messier was on hand, too, and they stood 
together soaking up the biggest cheers of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Everywhere at the Garden, fans wore No. 99 Rangers jerseys.  
Painted behind each net was a blue 99, so appropriate for the area 
known as ``Gretzky's office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A pregame light show featured spinning 99s projected onto the  
ice along with Gretzky's image; a short video of his career, also 
shown on the rink surface; and even a taped scoreboard message from 
The Great One thanking the fans for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne's father, who built an ice rink in the back yard ``for  
self-preservation -- I would freeze when I took him to skate on the 
ponds'' -- expects his son to make a clean break from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first few months, he's going to play golf,'' Walter  
Gretzky said. ``I know he'll never be a coach or general manager; 
they have the tough jobs. TV? I doubt that very much. You have to 
be at a certain place at a certain time, and he didn't even play 
the game that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He played in a way nobody ever has. Or might ever play it again.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Expects a New Cycle / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After the great bull market of the 1990s on Wall  
Street, the way investors look at cycles in the U.S. economy will 
never be the same again. 
</P>
<P>
	More than eight years have passed since the last recession in  
this country. Yet the economy lately has been acting as though a 
new growth phase is just beginning, rather than showing any signs 
of peaking. 
</P>
<P>
	The old idea that booms always set the stage for their own  
collapse has been seriously challenged. In particular, the 
optimists declare, the current expansion has proven that strong 
growth doesn't have to cause a revival of inflation and a 
tightening of credit conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists hasten to add that none of this means the cycle  
of growth, retrenchment and recovery has been abolished forever. 
What the current situation does demonstrate, they assert, is that 
each cycle is different from all previous ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Entering its ninth year of uninterrupted growth, the U.S.  
economy shows none of the danger signs that have presaged the end 
of previous economic expansions,'' says Davis Resler, chief 
economist at Nomura Securities International in New York. ``If 
anything, the economy has become even more robust with age. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. economy has shrugged off the deep and lingering  
recession in Asia, weathered a dramatic near-meltdown of the global 
financial markets, and even endured the impeachment of a president. 
The soaring stock market has been a perfect barometer of seeming 
invulnerability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The domestic economy has been especially strong over the past  
three years, just at the point when it appeared by many measures to 
have reached the limits of its capacity. Yet because inflation 
hasn't revived to date, the Federal Reserve hasn't felt compelled 
to adopt any sustained policy of credit-tightening. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, analysts say, new growth momentum appears to be building up  
with early signs of improvement in some overseas economies. ``Green 
shoots of cyclical revival are increasingly evident around the 
world,'' says Stephen Roach at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. is experiencing an incredible spending boom,''  
observes Bob Prince at Bridgewater Associates in Westport, Conn. 
``Up until the past few months this boom was offset by extremely 
weak exports. But in the past three months it has accelerated just 
as export demand has improved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That prospect raises some important concerns, including what  
might happen to commodity prices, labor costs and other components 
of inflation should the pace of business worldwide accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall,'' says Prince, ``conditions are contributing to  
rising pressures on the Fed to tighten. The markets are not 
prepared for such an event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some optimists on Wall Street argue that a quicker tempo  
could actually improve conditions in the stock market, where many 
issues have lagged behind over the past year while a few dozen blue 
chips have led the market indexes to new highs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. equity market has been a great place to be in the  
past several years, but only if you owned the right stocks,'' says 
John Manley, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few large-capitalization stocks with superior earnings  
growth have driven the market higher in a period of declining 
overall growth. But we are now seeing the first signs of a possible 
turnaround in earnings growth which, if sustained, could benefit 
value-oriented investment strategies.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates Farm Out RF Jose Guillen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates, upset with Jose  
Guillen's attitude and lack of power this season, demoted their 
starting right fielder to Triple-A Nashville on Sunday and didn't 
promise when he would be back. 
</P>
<P>
	The move ostensibly was made to clear roster room so rookie  
pitcher Todd Ritchie could start Sunday in Cincinnati. In reality, 
it signaled the Pirates had run out of patience with their talented 
but moody outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jose was shocked, probably because he's been here for two  
years now,'' manager Gene Lamont said. ``But I told him he needs to 
go down and start playing like Jose Guillen can play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to onlookers in the Pirates' clubhouse, Guillen was  
visibly upset with the news. Left fielder Al Martin, who regains 
his starting job with the move, pulled Guillen aside and delivered 
a 15-minute pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
	The demotion was surprising in part because it came so early in  
the season. The Pirates anticipated this might be the breakthrough 
year that Guillen drove in more than 100 runs and began hitting for 
more power. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen jumped directly from Class A to the Pirates' starting  
lineup in 1997 at age 20 and drove in 154 runs in his first two 
seasons, including 84 RBIs last year -- second on the club only to 
Kevin Young's 108. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen, 22, is batting .280, but had no homers, only 4 RBIs and  
just two extra-base hits. Last year, he hit 14 homers and jumped 
his doubles from 20 as a rookie to 38. 
</P>
<P>
	He also made several baserunning blunders, the latest Friday  
when he was tagged out between second and third base on Abraham 
Nunez's two-run single in the fourth inning of a 6-5 loss to the 
Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Jose needs to go down and start swinging the bat  
better,'' Lamont said. ``He's not swinging real bad, but he's not 
really pounding the ball like he can. I hope he goes down and has a 
good attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates and Guillen had a falling out during spring training  
when Guillen waited until the last minute to apply for an entry 
visa for his new wife. He wound up missing the first two weeks of 
camp and angering the team. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Cam Bonifay was especially critical of Guillen's  
handling of the situation. Guillen, in turn, felt the Pirates 
unfairly blamed him for a complicated problem that wasn't resolved 
until an immigration lawyer and Sen. Rick Santorum intervened. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needs to grow up,'' Bonifay said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bonifay was so upset that he weighed sending Guillen to  
Nashville just before spring training ended. But Lamont interceded, 
saying he wanted Guillen in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamont apparently needed only two weeks of the season to change  
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't really hit the ball like he could (during spring  
training) and he hasn't done it since the season started, either,'' 
Lamont said. ``He's just not swinging the bat the way he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Guillen out the lineup for now, Brian Giles shifts from  
left field to right field, with Martin playing most of the time in 
left. Freddy Garcia, who had nine homers in 172 at-bats last 
season, also will play some in left. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be a strict platoon,'' Lamont said.  
</P>
<P>
	Brant Brown will stay in center field and will start mostly  
against right-handers, with switch hitters Turner Ward and Adrian 
Brown also playing against left-handers.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Plans Rooftop Gardens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- City officials want to add a new architectural  
element to Chicago buildings -- green rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
	That's green as in grass, flowers and other plants.  
</P>
<P>
	The city environment department plans to plant gardens atop  
several city buildings this summer as part of a U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency program studying ways to help cool cities and 
reduce smog. 
</P>
<P>
	Dark-roofed buildings -- along with miles of pavement -- absorb  
the sun's rays, making Chicago a huge heat island and adding as 
much as four to six degrees to city thermometers, said William 
Abolt, acting commissioner of the city environment department. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city's wearing dark clothes and it's making the city  
hotter,'' Abolt said. ``We want to dress the city in lighter 
colors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hotter temperatures increase smog by forcing electric plants to  
work harder and emit more pollution, city and EPA officials said. 
Pollution reacts with heat and sunlight to create smog. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a big issue for Chicago, which consistently violates  
federal air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The rooftop gardens could begin with City Hall and other public  
buildings, such as schools, said Alexandra Holt, deputy director of 
the environment department. The first gardens could be planted this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The city also will plant trees and other vegetation in medians  
to help cool pavement, and will consider light-colored paving 
surfaces, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody knows how many roofs would have to be resurfaced or trees  
planted to make a measurable difference in heat and smog, said 
Virginia Gorsevski, program analyst with the EPA's office of air 
and radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer modeling predicts that widespread heat-reduction  
measures could easily lower a city's temperature 5 degrees, said 
Hashem Akbari, a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory in California, which performs the modeling. But no city 
has ever implemented wholesale changes to test the models' 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago is one of five cities participating in the EPA program  
and the only one promoting rooftop gardens, Gorsevski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The others -- Baton Rouge, La.; Houston; Sacramento, Calif.; and  
Salt Lake City -- are concentrating on roofing materials that 
reflect sunlight, Gorsevski said. Holt said Chicago officials 
focused on gardens because reflective roofing might make buildings 
more difficult to heat during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Akbari said gardens would offer benefits similar to those of  
reflective roofing, but could be more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, researchers are eager to see Chicago's results, Gorsevski  
said, adding that she knows of no U.S. city where such gardens have 
been tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Abolt said reducing emissions from vehicles and small,  
unregulated businesses -- the biggest contributors to smog -- or 
cracking down on industrial smokestack emissions isn't enough. 
Large industry contributes only about 20 percent of the pollution, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think traditional approaches to dealing with smog  
will solve the problem,'' Abolt said. 
</P>
<P>
	He's right, Akbari said. Based on modeling and results of  
small-scale testing, cooling a city could reduce smog more than 
almost every other pollution-fighting measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chemicals need an oven to cook in to produce smog,''  
Akbari said. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials will encourage private corporations to plant  
rooftop gardens. But the city must first monitor the benefits of 
its own project to prove it works, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The city is working with engineers and designers to plan the  
first gardens, which could be simple prairie grass or more 
elaborate plantings, Abolt said. He said the gardens must require 
little maintenance and the roofs must be able to bear the weight of 
the gardens, which will not be designed for people to use. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is to make it green and efficient,'' Abolt said.  
</P>
<P>
	Akbari said the potential benefits make the project worthwhile.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is a win, win, win case,'' Akbari said. ``You have a better  
environment, lower temperature and you save energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not rocket-science type of business.''

<HEADLINE> Sonia Gandhi Could Be New India PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- For years, Sonia Gandhi disdained  
politics and hid from public view. 
</P>
<P>
	When her mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated in 1984,  
she pleaded with her husband, Rajiv, against taking his mother's 
place as prime minister. When her husband was killed in 1991, she 
went into seclusion, shunning the politicians who begged her to 
lead them. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she reluctantly emerged from the shadows to accept the  
inheritance of India's foremost political dynasty a year ago, when 
the venerable Congress Party reached its lowest point. Now, the 
Italian-born widow may be India's next prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee lost a vote of  
confidence in parliament by one vote and resigned. His fall was 
precipitated by the defection of his biggest coalition ally. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congress Party, which the Gandhi family has dominated since  
Indira's father, Jawaharlal Nehru, led it in the 1930s, is likely 
to form the next government. If it cannot, an election will be held 
within months. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mrs. Gandhi did not initiate the government's downfall,  
she engineered the final blow. Indian newspapers said her personal 
lobbying on the telephone Friday night turned key votes against the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	For the enigmatic Mrs. Gandhi, it was a rare foray beyond her  
immediate circle. She is considered a strategist who lets her 
lieutenants carry out decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Still a political novice who has never held an elected office,  
she rarely speaks in public and does not hold news conferences or 
give lengthy interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi's campaigning before the 1998 elections was credited  
with rescuing the fast-declining, century-old party from oblivion. 
After the election, she agreed to become the party's president and 
focused on rebuilding it after years of scandal and ineffective 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she is an intensely private person, Indians have always  
been fascinated by Mrs. Gandhi. Her face is a favorite for magazine 
covers. Even during her years of silence, every private meeting, 
smile or nod was dissected by the Indian press, which speculated on 
who was in favor and who was out. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting dignitaries routinely called on her at her home, as if  
she were an elder statesman. 
</P>
<P>
	If she becomes prime minister, her Italian origin will come  
under greater scrutiny. During the three-day confidence debate, one 
speaker ignited a shoving match when he referred to Mrs. Gandhi as 
``a foreigner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anand Mohan, an opposition member who crossed sides to vote for  
the government, told reporters, ``A foreign national cannot be 
accepted as the prime minister. If I had to choose between Vajpayee 
and Sonia Gandhi, I would choose Vajpayee a thousand times.'' He 
noted that Mrs. Gandhi was married many years before adopting 
Indian citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	Although born a Roman Catholic, she shows public reverence for  
Hinduism, India's predominant religion. She wears saris and speaks 
a rough, accented Hindi. Her daughter Priyanka, 27, helps draft 
many of her speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, who is 51, met her husband when she was an  
18-year-old student at Cambridge in London, the first time she was 
away from her native Italy. During most of their courtship, she did 
not know he was the son of India's prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite doubts many have about a foreign-born leader, Mrs.  
Gandhi has won many hearts by embracing the essence of Indian 
lifestyle. For traditional Indians, that means becoming a loyal 
daughter-in-law and member of her husband's family. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was closer to Indira Gandhi than Sonia. When the prime  
minister was assassinated by her own bodyguards in 1984, it was 
Sonia who cradled the head of the dying woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother-in-law had been the center of our universe ... the  
pivot of our lives,'' Sonia Gandhi later wrote in a book. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the Congress Party turned to Rajiv, then a pilot for  
Indian Airlines, to take the leadership of the party, she begged 
him not to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pleaded with him, with others around him, too. He would be  
killed as well,'' she wrote in a book dedicated to her late 
husband. ``He held my hands, hugged me, tried to soothe my 
desperation. He had no choice, he said. He would be killed 
anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rajiv Gandhi served a full five-year term, but lost the 1989  
election when his name was linked to a payoff scandal in a huge 
arms deal. He was killed during a campaign appearance in south 
India by a woman who detonated explosives attached to her body.

<HEADLINE> Williams To Carry Saints' Load </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Coach Mike Ditka donned shoulder-length  
dreadlocks, fans wearing ``We got Ricky'' T-shirts chanted, 
screamed for autographs and snapped pictures. Some New Orleans 
Saints even started talking playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	And Ricky Williams thought he carried a big load in Texas.  
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans, which hasn't had a winning record in six years or a  
1,000-yard rusher in a decade, traded away every pick after the 
first one this year, and first- and third-round picks next year to 
get the Heisman Trophy winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did the thing that this organization thought would make us  
the best the fastest,'' Ditka said. ``The future is now. It's not 
the year 2002, it's now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We drafted him because he is a great football player. I don't  
think the Saints have had an identity football player, really since 
Archie (Manning). He's the first marquee player this organization 
has had in a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka, who joked he'd had his hair restyled Sunday morning to  
celebrate getting the big back with the distinctive hair style, 
compared Williams to Walter Payton, the Hall of Fame back who 
carried the Chicago Bears and Ditka to glory in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said that was an exaggeration, insisting he just plays  
hard and loves doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just run the ball and try to get to the end zone and  
whatever happens in between is just pretty much all instinct,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans has back-to-back 6-10 records under Ditka. Last  
year, the offense was ranked 28th in the NFL -- dead last in yards 
rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting Williams will change that, Saints officials believe.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is one player who's going to make our football team a lot  
better on offense,'' said general manager Bill Kuharich. ``He's 
going to help our tight ends, our wide receivers, our quarterback 
and our offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an awful lot of pressure to say that one player can get  
us to the Super Bowl. But if he can carry us on his back, God bless 
him. But I'm not putting undue pressure on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the pick puts enormous pressure on everyone in the  
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka promised when he took the job that he would only stay  
three years if he could not turn the team into a winner. Now, with 
the sacrifice of eight potential players over two years, he's 
betting everything on Williams sparking a turnaround in the worst 
offense in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, he's going to be huge if he can get into the season  
healthy,'' said quarterback Billy Joe Hobert. ``It's going to be 
good for the fans, and it's going to be good for us. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, we're just going to move it on. No excuses now. We better  
go on to the playoffs or every one of us is going to be finding a 
new job next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Williams' association with rapper Master P and No Limit  
Sports, which represents him, was reportedly one reason the 
Indianapolis Colts passed on him with the fourth pick. The Saints 
and William's agent, Leland Hardy, said they expect no problem 
working out a contract. But, Hardy said, he knows what he's looking 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mr. Williams should have a contract commensurate with  
his station as the greatest player in the history of the sport in 
the college game,'' Hardy said. ``Talk about his signability is of 
non-interest to me because all parties here are going into 
negotiations with a common interest. And that is to get Ricky 
Williams signed and in camp on time and try to get this football 
team to the playoffs and the Super Bowl as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on what Chicago Bears rookie running back Curtis Enis  
received in the No. 5 slot last year, Williams would get a five- or 
six-year contract worth about $2 million per season. The deal will 
include a signing bonus in the range of $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he wasn't worried about the money, just getting on  
the field. But then he heard about Ditka's entry into the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka was the fifth pick in the 1961 draft. He said he received  
a $6,000 signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to play that bad,'' Williams said.

<HEADLINE> Compaq President, CFO Both Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. president and chief  
executive officer Eckhard Pfeiffer resigned today, one day after 
the slumping PC giant's board of directors told him they wanted new 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board over a period of time came to the conclusion, not  
for a single event, that we should have a change,'' Benjamin M. 
Rosen, chairman of the world's largest personal computer maker, 
said Sunday in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer's resignation came just over a week after Compaq  
stunned Wall Street by announcing that first-quarter profits would 
be just half of analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said on April 9 that it expected to earn 15 cents  
per share in the quarter on revenue of $9.4 billion -- $600 million 
lower than expected -- in large part due to industrywide 
price-cutting. Final first-quarter results are expected to be 
announced later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq has struggled to maintain profits in an environment in  
which prices are dropping fast and sales of personal computers for 
under $500 -- or even less -- are growing. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this says is that things (at Compaq) are more screwed-up  
than even the results would have you believe,'' said Aaron 
Goldberg, vice president and principal analyst at Ziff-Davis Inc. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl Mason, Compaq's chief financial officer, also resigned  
Sunday in what Rosen said was an unrelated move. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Earl Mason's case, he was offered every CFO's dream: to be  
chief executive officer of a company,'' Rosen said. Rosen didn't 
identify the company, other than to say that it was in a totally 
different industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq treasurer Ben Wells will take on Mason's duties on at  
least an interim basis. Goldberg said he expects additional 
management changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Compaq, which traded as high as $51.25 earlier this  
year, dropped 22 percent on April 12, the first day of trading 
after the announcement. Compaq closed Friday at $23.62 1/2 on the New 
York Stock Exchange, barely above its 52-week low of $22.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the increasing complexity in changes in our business  
have required a change in leadership,'' said Rosen, who was named 
acting chief executive while the company searches for a permanent 
successor. ``We have re-energized this company before and, working 
together, we will do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen also said Compaq is well-positioned as a major player on  
the Internet, but Goldberg said the company has done little to take 
advantage of the Net so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the NFL draft: You have 31 guys based on potential,  
but haven't done anything yet. Compaq has tremendous potential but 
hasn't done anything yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Pfeiffer stuck to the positive. ``Compaq has  
come a long way since I joined the company in 1983,'' he said. ``We 
are a world leader in personal computing, enterprise computing and 
Internet applications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer, who took over as CEO in October 1991, created the  
strategy that helped make Compaq the leader in global PC sales. His 
belief in a computer run by a Microsoft Windows operating system 
and powered by an Intel microchip help solidify the ``Wintel'' 
platform as the dominant one in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Compaq shipped 12.8 million computers worldwide to gain  
14 percent of the market, according to the research firm Dataquest 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But, analysts say Compaq has struggled to assimilate fellow  
computer maker Digital Equipment, which it acquired last year for 
$9 billion. Sales of Digital's minicomputers -- medium-sized 
corporate computing systems that are smaller than mainframes -- have 
disappointed analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Compaq has never fully integrated Tandem Computers,  
which it bought in 1997. Tandem makes technology that helps 
clusters of computers run together and continuously, overcoming 
such problems as power failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq sells computers through a traditional distribution  
structure that includes resellers who act as a middleman and take a 
share of the profits. This has placed it at a disadvantage against 
companies such as Dell Computer Co. and Gateway, which sell 
directly to customers by phone or over the Internet and allow 
customers to create any kind of system they want. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq has faced difficulty emulating this model. Analysts said  
it has alienated Compaq's resellers -- including retail stores -- who 
are apt to see Compaq as a potential sales rival and instead may 
focus on selling other companies' brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen indicated Compaq will continue to allow customers a choice  
in how they buy computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feeling now is that we shouldn't dictate how a customer  
buys a computer, whether it's directly, through a value-added 
reseller or through the Internet,'' said Rosen, Compaq's chairman 
since its inception in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq has said it plans to boost the computer services it  
offers business customers as a way to boost declining profits from 
sales.

<HEADLINE> Liver Transplant Boy Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A 4-year-old boy who has undergone three liver  
transplants -- including one in which he received a piece of his 
uncle's liver -- was allowed to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Maurer has a condition that causes scarring and  
narrowing of the bile ducts, which causes bile to back up into the 
liver and damage it. He was released from Children's Hospital of 
Wisconsin on Saturday, and doctors have said they are optimistic 
about Nicholas' health. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas received a liver from a dead donor on Dec. 1, but that  
liver failed because of a clot in the artery that nourishes it. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the boy received a piece of his uncle Donald  
Maurer's liver. That operation was said to be Wisconsin's first 
liver transplant from a living donor. 
</P>
<P>
	However, doctors became concerned a few weeks later when the  
ammonia level in the boy's blood began to rise, indicating liver 
failure. That brought about the need for the third liver 
transplant, at the end of February. That liver came from a child 
who died in a fire.

<HEADLINE> 'Dream True' Tells Tale of Friends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Peter Emmons, a beleaguered architect, needs  
space, literally and psychologically. Or so he sings in ``Dream 
True,'' the tale of two boyhood friends who discover they can 
communicate through dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	What Peter needs even more is a better musical, preferably one  
with a coherent story and an accessible score that can tell his 
troubles with a lot more oomph than found in this earnest and 
pretentious show on view at off-Broadway's Vineyard Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	In a glum season for new musicals, ``Dream True'' is one of the  
most muddled, stranding its talented cast and leaving theatergoers 
bewildered. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Tina Landau also provided the book and most of the  
lyrics. She strikes out with all three. ``Dream True,'' apparently 
based on a George du Maurier novel ``Peter Ibbetson,'' has no shape 
or flow. It floats aimlessly like a cloud, scattering its 
performers across the stage in arty poses as it tells a convoluted 
yarn. 
</P>
<P>
	Landau's lyrics rarely rise above the commonplace, not doing  
much to untangle the story or at least make it more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	Little Peppy (later Peter) and young Verne are best friends back  
in Wyoming in the mid-1940s. But the friendship breaks up after 
Peppy's Uncle Howard spirits the lad back East to New Haven, Conn., 
to get an education. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter goes to Yale, finds a girl (the sober-sided Madge played  
by the sad-eyed Judy Kuhn), becomes an architect in New York, pines 
for Verne and suffers a breakdown. Verne also comes to New York, 
becomes a gay activist, becomes HIV-positive and dies. 
</P>
<P>
	That's an awful lot of plot to get through, but despite all the  
story, no real characters emerge. Not even Peter develops, despite 
the heroic efforts of performer Jeff McCarthy to turn him into a 
credible human being. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy has a strong voice and a winning manner, but there is  
little for him to hang the character on. Daniel Jenkins, as the 
sought-after Verne, has even less to work with. 
</P>
<P>
	The score by Ricky Ian Gordon does contain some promising  
musical material. There's a lovely lyrical moment early in the 
first act called ``Finding Home,'' but it is sung by Peter's 
mother, who quickly disappears. At least the song is reprised at 
the end of Act 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The settings by G.W. Mercier and production designs by Jan  
Hartley suggest Georgia O'Keeffe, by way of Magritte. Sort of 
American West meets Belgian surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
	The other-worldly surroundings help produce a distancing effect.  
Maybe ``Dream True'' wants to remove itself from any kind of 
emotional connection with the audience. In that respect, it 
succeeds.

<HEADLINE> KJ: No NBA This Season, Maybe Never </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Kevin Johnson says he won't play in the NBA this  
season and probably is finished for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, in Phoenix for a ceremony honoring former teammate Tom  
Chambers, said Sunday that he's had plenty of opportunities but 
never found the ideal situation that would have lured him back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'm going to play, but I'm not going to rule it  
out until after the summmer,'' Johnson said. ``I'll evaluate it in 
the summer and then make a final determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson played all 11 of his NBA seasons with the Suns. He is  
the team's career assists leader and No. 3 scorer, but he and the 
franchise parted ways after last season when the Suns decided to go 
with Jason Kidd as the team's undispited floor leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he never found a situation that seemed good enough  
for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me to put on another uniform,'' Johnson said.  
```I knew that all along. I knew when I stepped down from here that 
it would be almost impossible for me to play anywhere else. It 
would take an ideal situation. I told everybody no. Every other 
team in the league called me -- the Lakers right off the bat. But I 
just can't put on another uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Johnson said, he misses the NBA.  
</P>
<P>
	``I miss my teammates. I miss the fans. This has been a part of  
my life since I was 13-14 years old. You know, 20 years. There's 
nothing like NBA basketball. That was a great period of my life. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to move on and have no regrets and take all the  
good memories with me that I've bottled up, it's great. I don't 
actually feel I made the wrong choice by not playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's in good enough shape to play right now.  
</P>
<P>
	``My body's better than it's ever been,'' he said. ``I can walk  
up stairs and my body doesn't hurt. I feel great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson might be back at America West Arena someday to have his  
name added to the list that now includes Chambers, Walter Davis, 
Paul Westphal, Alvan Adams, Connie Hawkins and Dick Van Arsdale. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know,'' he said, ``but I'm too young to be talking  
about that. That's for old guys.''

<HEADLINE> Collins is Miami's Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson got his man today: Cecil Collins,  
the troubled, talented running back from Louisiana. And the Miami 
Dolphins needed no more than the first choice of the NFL draft's 
fifth round to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the good things about Cecil is he admits he made a lot  
of mistakes, stupid mistakes and wants to put his life back in 
order,'' Johnson said of Collins, who played just five college 
games at LSU and McNeese State before injury and arrest ended his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got tremendous running ability, can break tackles with  
great speed. He makes things happen every time he touches the 
ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draft plodded through its second day in the theater at  
Madison Square Garden, even more of a sideshow than usual -- seven 
floors above Wayne Gretzky was ending his hockey career for the New 
York Rangers against the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no run on quarterbacks like Saturday, when the first  
three picks overall and five of the first 12 went on the position. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Germaine of Ohio State, whom some draft analysts thought  
might sneak into the first or second round, was chosen with the 
sixth pick of the fourth round by the St. Louis Rams -- the eighth 
QB chosen. Aaron Brooks of Virginia went late in the fourth round 
to Green Bay, and Kevin Daft of Cal-Davis was taken by Tennessee in 
the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	But no more went until the seventh round, when New England chose  
Michael Bishop, the Kansas State star who might also be used as a 
running back or wide receiver. Chris Greisen of Northwest Missouri, 
taken by Arizona, and Scott Covington of Miami, chosen by 
Cincinnati, went in the seventh round, making it 13 QBs drafted in 
253 picks. 
</P>
<P>
	One player who dropped way down was safety Anthony Poindexter of  
Virginia, who would likely have been a first-round pick had he not 
severely injured his knee last season. He went to Baltimore in the 
seventh and final round. Notre Dame's star running back, Autry 
Denson, also went in the seventh -- to Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The last pick, who will be honored at ``Irrelevant Week'' in  
Newport Beach, Calif., was Jim Finn, chosen by Chicago. Finn, a 
running back from Pennsylvania, was in the audience and received a 
loud ovation from the sparse crowd remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm going to camp and prove I'm not Mr. Irrelevant,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trades continued Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	The draft finished with 26, none bigger than Saturday's  
first-round blockbuster in which New Orleans surrendered its entire 
draft plus first- and third-round choices next year to Washington 
to select running back Ricky Williams with the fifth overall pick. 
The Redskins then dealt some of the acquired picks to Chicago, and 
ended up with cornerback Champ Bailey, the player they wanted 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	So New Orleans spent Sunday without a pick, the only time in  
draft history that a team had just one choice. 
</P>
<P>
	That made a Sunday headliner of Collins, who in a deal worked  
out just before the draft pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and 
two felonies. He got four years probation for breaking into two 
apartments and fondling two young women. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone in the NFL knew Johnson was willing to take a chance on  
him, as he did unsuccessfully with Lawrence Phillips two years ago. 
But nobody was sure when Jimmy would jump at a back who in three 
games at LSU in 1987 ran for 583 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out to be late enough so that it was practically a  
no-lose situation for the Dolphins, who hope Collins can emulate 
the feats of Minnesota wide receiver Randy Moss, who fell to 21st 
overall last season because of off-field problems and ended up an 
All-Pro and the offensive rookie of the year.. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is giving people second chances. If they don't do  
what's right we go on with our business,'' said Johnson, who said 
Collins reminds him of ``a faster Emmitt Smith.'' ``He's a risk. 
That's why we waited until the fifth round. Everyone in the league 
wanted to take him.''

<HEADLINE> College Studies Dead Classmate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- There were 13 young women in the  
Douglass College honors seminar last semester -- 14, if you include 
Clara. 
</P>
<P>
	And you had to include Clara, though she came from another time,  
when college women kept curfews, wore long, white gloves to 
formals, and passed the time between classes in tea rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	You had to include Clara, though she had been dead for a  
half-century. 
</P>
<P>
	For four months, as a class project, these sophomores and  
juniors studied Clara Kangler and a tragic life that ended long 
before they were born. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, many considered her a friend.  
</P>
<P>
	This is a story about how very different young people are today  
from their forbears, and how very much the same. And it is a story 
about time travel, about how people from one time can reach back to 
those of another and almost -- ALMOST -- come to know them. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``She was aware, with almost a painful clarity, that life was a  
continual struggle ... and she was aware that it held, as a whole, 
a chain of disappointments and personal failures for all.'' -- from 
the unfinished novel of Clara Kangler. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	When Clara's sister, Elsie, died in 1996, she left a trove of  
papers and artifacts that found its way to Rutgers University. 
</P>
<P>
	Clara was an alum, though not a famous one like Paul Robeson or  
Calista Flockhart. She attended New Jersey College for Women, the 
forerunner of Douglass, Rutgers' college for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Deirdre Kramer, head of the Douglass scholars program, had long  
been interested in ``psychobiography'' -- telling the story of an 
interior life. So she issued a challenge to her students: Could 
they take these faded papers and reconstruct Clara Kangler? 
</P>
<P>
	She was born Aug. 14, 1917, to Alois and Johanna Kangler,  
Slovenian immigrants. (Elsie was four years older.) She graduated 
from high school with honors; even then, there were indications 
that she was depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just another dull, uninteresting day,'' she wrote in her  
diary. ``Will this drudgery ever end? In my heart, I know it 
will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The students studied her scrapbooks from college, keepsakes from  
the 1938 Senior Class ball, the receipt for her $100 tuition, her 
yearbook entry (``Her ambition centers about magazine writing and 
extensive travel. Alone, Clare?''). 
</P>
<P>
	They interviewed her classmates. ``She was a very pretty girl  
and seemed to be kind of always involved and rushing around,'' says 
Alice Talbot Sofin, 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Clara graduated with distinction in English, and went on to get  
her master's at Columbia; they read her thesis on feminist writer 
Sarah Grand. 
</P>
<P>
	After all of that education, she took one secretarial job after  
another. ``I can take dictation at 100 words per minute and am a 
rapid and accurate typist,'' she wrote, in one letter of 
application. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she suffered some sort of breakdown -- apparently as a  
result of a love affair gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is exactly one year to the day that I last saw Charles  
F.,'' she wrote to Elsie in March 1947. ``And ... as of tomorrow I 
began that long series of trotting to doctors and going to pieces 
generally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By 1947, she had moved to Miami Beach, Fla.  
</P>
<P>
	Seemingly, she had recovered. She took on more secretarial work,  
but she intended to finish her novel. ``The book is progressing as 
I expected. I'm really going to devote a lot of time to it from now 
on ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she also wanted to snare a husband.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be damned if I'm going to piddle around with small change  
and during the season I may be able to snag someone with a pile,'' 
she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Clara and Elsie were both fine writers, and they come alive in  
130 letters they exchanged in the seven months Clara was away. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsie is the conservative one. ``Apparently, you just blab  
everything that comes to your mind,'' she tells Clara. Her news is 
mundane -- the radio in the kitchen has been repaired, Mother has 
put up a batch of sauerkraut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clara is the free spirit. ``At 33, my dear, you should get over  
your inhibitions as far as sex is concerned,'' she tells Elsie. She 
wants to give her brown hair a henna rinse, she complains about 
roommates and her period. She wards off a pass from a married man 
with whom she had had an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little Clara is steering clear of any extra-marital  
entanglements,'' she writes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last weeks of her stay, the letters become sparse and  
less effervescent. ``Am still feeling pretty low, and am still 
undecided about what to do ... I'm afraid my fine fervour is 
wearing thin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the letters stop. Clara returned to New Jersey in June and  
took a job as a teacher at Drake's Business College. 
</P>
<P>
	The last items in the collection are Mass cards, an obituary, a  
note from Elsie about Clara's death on Sept. 17, 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Douglass scholars did not stop there.  
</P>
<P>
	They went to the house in Dunellen where the Kangler family had  
lived. And they went into the basement and traced Elsie's steps to 
the place where, 51 years before, she found her sister's body 
hanging from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If you love me,  
</P>
<P>
	``As I love you --  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing but Death  
</P>
<P>
	``Can part us two.''  
</P>
<P>
	--Clara to Elsie, May 9, 1930.  
</P>

	Althea Miller knew all along that Clara killed herself. Still,  
when this 28-year-old archivist read through the letters and came 
to their sudden end, it took her breath away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tears just came to my eyes,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	Aubrey Garrison had embraced Clara -- ``I really feel that a part  
of her personality and of what she brought into the world is now 
part of me'' -- and she was horrified by the basement where Clara's 
life ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went into the room, and I had to leave ...,'' says Garrison,  
a 20-year-old English and exercise science major. ``It made Clara 
more real. It made it impossible to deny it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Garrison and most of her classmates, this was an experience  
unlike any other. They shared their discoveries. ``Guess what Clara 
did!'' they would say. Gradually, they shared intimate details of 
their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The things that people seemed to find in Clara were things  
they found in themselves,'' says Dana Bowling, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Great aspirations. Feelings of inadequacy. Struggles with  
relationships. Passions. High spirits. Low spirits. All of these 
things, they saw in Clara and they saw in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Caught in the grip of a life that ended at mid-century, they  
sometimes found it hard to understand those times. 
</P>
<P>
	They ``took for granted opportunities available to them; they  
were struck by the limited number of opportunities for someone like 
Clara,'' says Kramer, their professor. 
</P>
<P>
	For graduates of the 1930s, says Mrs. Sofin, Clara's classmate,  
``there was teaching, nursing, retailing and secretarial work, and 
that was it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aubrey Garrison says Clara ``just wasn't fulfilled.'' And for  
all her talk about writing, there is no indication that she 
accomplished anything. Just three pages of her book survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Did she kill herself because she was unable to find work that  
matched her abilities, and was unmarried at an age when most of her 
classmates had long since wed? Was she unhinged by a thyroid 
condition, for which she had been treated? Or was she merely a 
victim of depression? 
</P>
<P>
	After all of their research, the class had to admit defeat.  
Clara's pain was palpable, but the reasons for it were unknowable. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsie might have been able to tell them more. But with Elsie's  
death, all intimate memories of Clara Kangler disappeared from the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	It was left to 13 young women, her spiritual heirs, to bring her  
back.

<HEADLINE> BoSox First Pitch by UConn Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Connecticut basketball coach Jim Calhoun threw out  
the first pitch today at Fenway Park and said he expects his team 
to look different next season as it defends the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, a native of Boston, said he expects All-America forward  
Richard Hamilton will not return for his senior year and will 
declare for the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will know more when I speak to him this week,'' Calhoun  
said. ``Last year it was a situation where I talked to people and 
it didn't appear he was ready, but this year is a different 
story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players have until May 15 to declare for the draft.  
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun also said he will be taking disciplinary action against  
Khalid El-Amin following the sophomore point guard's arrest last 
week for possession of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	``The courts have taken their action and we will be taking ours  
when the 1999-2000 campaign starts,'' Calhoun said, referring to 
El-Amin's sentence of of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun also dismissed rumors that he would consider leaving  
Connecticut for another college or pro coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only if I were offered silly money by some pro team would that  
be an option,'' said Calhoun, who just completed his 13th season 
with the Huskies. ``I'm planning on retiring at UConn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut's 77-74 victory over top-ranked Duke on March 29  
gave the school its first national championship in its first Final 
Four appearance.

<HEADLINE> Penn Fullback Latest Mr. Irrelevant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Finding this year's ``Mr. Irrelevant''  
took some doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to get the last pick in the draft, and get a guy  
from the Ivy League, and find him at the place to draft him,'' Mark 
Hatley, the Chicago Bears' vice president of player personnel, said 
with a laugh. ``That was the toughest thing for us to do in the 
draft, but it's sort of funny how things fall out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears made Pennsylvania fullback Jim Finn this year's ``Mr.  
Irrelevant,'' the title affectionately given to the last player 
taken in the draft over the last few years. Besides a chance to 
make the Chicago roster, Finn gets a trip to Disneyland and a 
parade as part of an extended series of festivities in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Finn was in New York for the pick, which was announced by ``Mr.  
Irrelevant'' founder Paul Salata. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I'm going to go to camp and prove I'm not `Mr.  
Irrelevant,'' Finn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last pick of the draft was supposed to go the expansion  
Cleveland Browns, but they traded it to the Bears. Chicago was 
looking for a fullback throughout the draft, and when the last pick 
rolled around, there was Finn. 
</P>
<P>
	Finn is fourth on Penn's career list with 2,277 yards rushing,  
and fifth with 180 points scored. He's also been used as a 
third-down receiver, and at 255 pounds, the Bears think he'll be a 
good blocker. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there are those ``intangibles'' coaches love to talk  
about on draft day. He's an Ivy Leaguer -- just like new coach Dick 
Jauron, though Jauron is a Yalie. And, Hatley said, Finn went to 
Penn, alma mater of Bears' chairman emeritus Ed McCaskey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of those things that all fell in place,'' Hatley  
said.

<HEADLINE> 'Great' Gretzky Plays Last NHL Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky, the classiest of athletes, bid a  
tearful farewell to hockey Sunday and took with him forever his 
famed No. 99. 
</P>
<P>
	During a rousing celebration of his record-shattering career,  
Gretzky was told by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman before his final 
game that no one in the league will wear that number again. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the first of several times Gretzky became teary. It  
happened again when his father, Walter, was driven to center ice in 
a new black Mercedes presented to Gretzky as a parting gift. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel so lucky to be able to play in the NHL,'' the sport's  
greatest player said. ``I've been so fortunate to play with some of 
the greatest players, against guys I admired so much, like the best 
player I ever played against Mario Lemieux ... my teammates and, of 
course, the best player I ever played with, Mark Messier. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it would be nothing without family and the great  
friendships I have developed over the years. I appreciate all the 
accolades. I tell everyone the greatest place to play is right here 
in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who announced his retirement Friday, wore a huge grin  
as friend Bryan Adams sang ``O, Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss you, Wayne,'' Adams ad-libbed late in the  
song. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star-Spangled Banner,'' as sung by John Amirante, was  
altered to include the words ``in the land of Wayne Gretzky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who holds or shares 61 NHL records, opened the game  
facing off against the Pittsburgh Penguins' Martin Straka, and won 
the faceoff, naturally. Otherwise, the shift was uneventful. 
</P>
<P>
	The first ovation, when Gretzky was introduced by master of  
ceremonies John Davidson, was accompanied by chants from the 
Madison Square Garden crowd of ``Gretz-ky, Gretz-ky'' and a 
three-minute salute that seemed to make the man of honor almost 
uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he skated to the Penguins bench and shared hugs and  
handshakes with several players as the rhythmic applause continued. 
He even pointed to the crowd at banners that said ``Thanks for the 
Memories,'' ``Always in Our Hearts: No. 99'' and ``Gretzky the 
Greatest Forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his family standing at center ice, along with teammates  
Brian Leetch, Adam Graves and Jeff Beukeboom, Edmonton Oilers 
president Glen Sather was introduced. Gretzky shared a hug with his 
first pro coach, and then did the same with Lemieux, who retired in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, Canada's greatest sports hero, left Edmonton in 1988,  
tears streaming down his cheeks after a trade to Los Angeles. He 
said goodbye to Hollywood in 1996, dealt to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came to the Rangers -- already hockey's biggest hero  
everywhere else -- he rejoined Messier, who was New York's leader 
and had helped the team win its first Stanley Cup in 44 years. When 
Gretzky left Sunday, Messier was on hand, too, and they stood 
together soaking up the biggest cheers of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Everywhere at the Garden, fans wore No. 99 Rangers jerseys.  
Painted behind each net was a blue 99, so appropriate for the area 
known as ``Gretzky's office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A pregame light show featured spinning 99s projected onto the  
ice along with Gretzky's image; a short video of his career, also 
shown on the rink surface; and even a taped scoreboard message from 
The Great One thanking the fans for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne's father, who built an ice rink in the back yard ``for  
self-preservation -- I would freeze when I took him to skate on the 
ponds'' -- expects his son to make a clean break from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first few months, he's going to play golf,'' Walter  
Gretzky said. ``I know he'll never be a coach or general manager; 
they have the tough jobs. TV? I doubt that very much. You have to 
be at a certain place at a certain time, and he didn't even play 
the game that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He played in a way nobody ever has. Or might ever play it again.

<HEADLINE> Nomo Hopes for Promotion to Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- If the Chicago Cubs want him, Hideo Nomo  
says he'll be ready. 
</P>
<P>
	But will he get that call? The former NL Rookie of the Year will  
find out by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs will decide Nomo's fate with the organization after he  
makes a third start for Triple-A Iowa on Thursday. If he comes 
close to matching what he did Saturday night, Nomo can expect to 
find himself back in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo struck out 10 in six-plus innings against Las Vegas,  
allowing three hits and two runs, both of which scored after he 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as being a step closer to the major leagues, that's out  
of my control,'' Nomo said through an interpreter. ``As I said the 
other day, it's not my decision. It's in the hands of the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The club liked what it saw.  
</P>
<P>
	Nomo's pitches were clocked at 86-92 mph and he hit 91 mph in  
the sixth inning. After walking the game's leadoff batter on four 
pitches, Nomo struck out eight of the next nine and allowed only 
one ball to be hit to the outfield in the first four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, it was encouraging,'' said David Wilder, the Cubs'  
assistant general manager. ``That's a lot better command than he's 
had in a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to make a decision on his arm today, there's nothing  
wrong with his arm,'' Wilder said. ``His arm is still there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, who won the rookie award in 1995 with the Los Angeles  
Dodgers, was released by the New York Mets after an unimpressive 
spring and was signed by the Cubs earlier this month. The team and 
Nomo agreed that after three starts, the Cubs would decide whether 
to call him up or release him. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old right-hander said he never lost his confidence  
and would be ready if the Cubs called on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course,'' he said. ``I would be more than ready.''  
</P>
<P>
	After a rocky start in his first game a week ago, Nomo retired  
nine of the last 10 batters. He went five innings and gave up three 
runs and six hits, striking out three and walking three. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo was much sharper Saturday night as he mixed his best pitch,  
the split-finger fastball, with a straight fastball and curve. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time, we saw glimpses. This time he came right out  
in the first inning and held it through the sixth,'' Iowa Cubs 
pitching coach Rick Kranitz said. ``The next time, hopefully, we'll 
see even more. It seemed like when he wanted to put a little more 
on the ball, he put it there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Nomo was working against a team that was hitting just  
.220, last in the Pacific Coast League, Kranitz felt he was good 
enough much of the time to get major-league hitters out. Nomo was 
noncommittal on that subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' he said. ``They're not major-league hitters,  
so you can't actually compare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo was lifted in the seventh with a 2-0 lead after Las Vegas  
loaded the bases on two walks sandwiched around a single. Las Vegas 
tied it against reliever Ray King, so Nomo wasn't involved in the 
decision. The I-Cubs won 3-2 on Alan Zinter's 11th-inning home run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think once he got to the seventh inning, it looked like he  
might have been a little bit out of gas,'' Kranitz said. ``But I 
thought he got better as the game went along. That's good to see. 
Ten strikeouts is a pretty good performance by anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Ruiz, Sorgi Dominate Diving Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Ruiz, competing in his hometown, and  
Californian Erica Sorgi continued their superiority over the rest 
of the field in the final day of action at the U.S. Spring National 
Diving Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz, 20, won his third and fourth national titles of the week,  
claiming individual honors in the men's platform 10-meter finals 
and combining with Justin Dumais to win the men's synchronized 
platform title. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorgi, 16, of Mission Viejo, won her second individual title in  
as many days, following up her triumph in the 3M with a first-place 
finish in the platform event. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz earned his win with a final score of 642.51, nearly 30  
points better than that of Troy Dumais. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's 3-meter finals, Troy Dumais also finished second,  
but the circumstances were much different. He led Ruiz heading into 
the final round of dives before a late surge and faulty final dive 
cost him the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no such drama in the platform event. Ruiz's victory  
was never in doubt, as the partisan crowd cheered his every dive. 
</P>
<P>
	With individual victories in the 1-meter, 3-meter, and platform  
events, Ruiz becomes the first diver to achieve that feat since 
Greg Louganis did it in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The hat trick was even sweeter because it came in front of  
friends and family at an event only a few miles from his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing it at home is the best part of it. I kept thinking,  
'What would it be like to win three in a row?' Even before the meet 
started, I thought about it,'' Ruiz said. ``It's a marathon though, 
really an exhausting week. I dove in every event and reached all of 
the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really couldn't have done it without the fans. I wanted to  
do it for them, and it is thanks to them that it happened. I'm just 
happy that they came out to support me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to his second-place finish, Troy Dumais will join Ruiz at  
the Pan American and World University Games. Mike Collier and 
Justin Dumais -- Troy's brother -- finished third and fourth, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Dumais and Ruiz ran away with the synchronized platform  
event, making the national team, along with second-place finishers 
Josh Edelman and Adam Hazes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorgi won the platform event relatively easily. Her score of  
478.92 was over 24 points better than Kathy Pesek. 
</P>
<P>
	Both qualified for the Pan American and World University Games.  
</P>
<P>
	Sorgi has now won five national titles, but her sweep of the  
3-meter and platform events is the first time she's ever won both 
in the same competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a step in the right direction for me,'' Sorgi  
said. ``This platform win is satisfying because it's only the 
second time I've competed in it at Nationals. It's about a year 
before the Olympics, so I'm definitely improving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've still got a way to go, but I'm really happy.''  
</P>
<P>
	In the women's synchronized platform finals, Kristen Link and  
Lindsay Long defeated Laura Wilkinson and Patty Armstrong. But both 
pair made the national team.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Threat Disrupts Maine Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUNSWICK, Maine (AP) -- A single phone call just after midnight  
turned this town upside down for a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone called police to say there was a bomb in the local high  
school. Less than an hour later, officer Mark Lafountain could hear 
his heart pounding as he and several bomb-sniffing dogs were 
inching through the dimly lit school. 
</P>
<P>
	No bomb was found. But the threat alone shut down the town's six  
schools for the day, forcing parents to scramble for day care and 
tacking an extra school day onto the summer holiday for 3,322 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	That was one of at least six bomb scares at Maine schools over  
the past month -- reflecting a problem across the country. Mindful 
of terrorist attacks and recent school violence, authorities can no 
longer consider bomb threats as mere crank calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the significant levels of violence that our public  
schools have experienced for the past year and a half, it has 
dramatically changed the way threats are being handled,'' said 
Ronald Stephens at the National School Safety Center near Los 
Angeles. ``Threats can no longer be taken lightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In East Montpelier, Vt., educators got so fed up after seven  
bomb threats at a high school that they decided to rethink the 
policy of canceling school. Instead, school was moved outside. 
Lunch was served from trucks and portable toilets lined the 
athletic field. 
</P>
<P>
	After five threats in two weeks last fall, Fort Dodge Senior  
High School in Iowa began requiring that materials be delivered in 
clear containers. Students are greeted by two guards posted at the 
building's only entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland's Anne Arundel County, hundreds of students phoned  
in or posted bogus bomb threats, forcing nearly daily evacuations. 
Now callers to at least one Annapolis high school are greeted by a 
warning that calls may be recorded or traced. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, the Lower Camden County Regional School District  
adopted a tough expulsion policy last year after it had 50 hoaxes 
at its four schools. Criminal charges have been filed against 27 
people, including 24 students. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no precise figures on the number of bomb threats at  
schools because educators are not required to report such 
incidents, said Michael Higgins, special programs coordinator for 
the Maine Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if there is no bomb to go with a threat, it's still a  
headache for authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge disruption in the normal course of business,''  
said Brunswick Police Chief Jerry Hinton. ``This just isn't kids 
out of school for a day. You can't put a dollar figure on it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In Brunswick, Lafountain and the dogs had to check out the  
entire school, including lockers, ceiling tiles and the noisy 
boiler room. 
</P>
<P>
	He could not turn on the lights, nor could he use radio  
communications, because of fears that electricity or radio waves 
could set off an explosive device. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening classroom doors was terrifying.  
</P>
<P>
	``You always wonder if it's booby trapped,'' he said.

 *Rege Cordic    	
</P>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Rege Cordic, host of one of the city's most  
popular radio programs, died Friday of brain cancer and related 
complications. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordic died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where  
he lived since leaving Pittsburgh in 1965 to pursue a career in 
film and television. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, his ``Cordic &AMP; Co.'' show commanded 85 percent of  
Pittsburgh's radio audience. 
</P>
<P>
	He launched his career in March 1943 while he was still a high  
school student, nagging radio host Davy Tyson to let him go on the 
air at WWSW. Cordic became the show's junior announcer and took 
over for Tyson when he went to another station. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to KDKA in 1954, bringing a cast of characters such as  
the wealthy Baldwin McMoney, punster Carmen Monoxide and Louie the 
Garbage Man. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordic himself did two of the show's most famous characters,  
Omicron and Neutnicron, by prerecording them on vinyl discs and 
interacting live with them as he played them back at altered 
speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordic's popularity never caught on in Los Angeles, where his  
show lasted just two years. He became a prolific network TV 
announcer and appeared in such movies as Woody Allen's ``Sleeper'' 
and Brian De Palma's ``Obsession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, a sister, and four children.  

</P>
<P>
 *Don McGuire    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Don McGuire, a screenwriter, actor and  
director who penned ``Bad Day at Black Rock'' and co-created the 
story of ``Tootsie,'' died Tuesday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Working in the movie industry since the mid-1940s, McGuire won  
Screenwriters Guild awards for ``Bad Day,'' which starred Spencer 
Tracy as a mysterious stranger in a desert town, and the 
cross-dressing comedy, ``Tootsie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire also directed Frank Sinatra to a breakthrough role in  
the western ``Johnny Concho,'' which portrayed the ultra-cool 
crooner as a coward struggling to build courage for a gun fight. 
</P>
<P>
	As an actor, McGuire was Red Skelton's straight man in ``The  
Fuller-Brush Man'' and appeared in several other movies in the 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Chicago, McGuire joined the Army during World War II,  
but was sent home after hurting his back in a jeep accident. He 
briefly shot photos for the Chicago Tribune and later worked as a 
publicist in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Focusing on screenwriting in the 1950s, McGuire wrote and  
directed Jerry Lewis' first film after the comic broke with Dean 
Martin. The film, ``The Delicate Delinquent,'' has Lewis playing a 
juvenile offender who becomes a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	In later years, McGuire and writer Larry Gelbart, shared story  
credit on ``Tootsie,'' which starred Dustin Hoffman as an 
out-of-work actor who dresses as a woman to land a female role on a 
popular TV soap opera. 

</P>
<P>
 *Albert 'Poppy' Popwell    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Character actor Albert ``Poppy'' Popwell, who  
played various thugs in Clint Eastwood's ``Dirty Harry'' films, 
died April 9 of complications from open-heart surgery. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Popwell appeared as heavies in ``Dirty Harry'' and its sequels  
``Magnum Force'' and ``The Enforcer'' before graduating to a police 
detective in the series' fourth installment ``Sudden Impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwood, as Dirty Harry, trained his magnum on Popwell's  
character and challenged him to ``Go ahead, make my day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popwell's career in entertainment spanned six decades on the  
stage and in film. The New York City native grew up during the 
Harlem Renaissance and danced in Broadway shows as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	Popwell also had roles in the films ``Cleopatra Jones,''  
``Coogan's Bluff'' and ``The Buddy Holly Story.'' He made 
appearances on such TV series as ``The A-Team,'' ``Wonder Woman,'' 
and ``Night Gallery.'' 

</P>

 *Eddie Saunders    	
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Eddie Saunders, a onetime hotel bellboy  
and street performer who broke the color barrier in Columbus radio 
and television, died Saturday on his 90th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders was best known for his radio program ``Sermons and  
Songs'', which began its Sunday run on WVKO-AM in 1948. The show 
was on the air until 1995, when failing health forced Saunders to 
end the program's long run at age 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders also became a TV pioneer through a weekly show on  
WTVN-TV, now WSYX, beginning in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	James ``Eddie'' Saunders was born April 17, 1909, in Virginia.  
During the Depression years he searched for work, singing and 
dancing on street corners for tips. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon his arrival in Columbus during the World War II years, the  
city ``was one of the most segregated'' in the United States, 
Saunders recalled in a 1994 interview. 
</P>
<P>
	During the weekly ``Sermons and Songs,'' Saunders would chat  
with callers, take song requests and relate words of wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always aspired to inspire a race of people, especially when  
there were no black radio or TV personalities,'' Saunders said upon 
his 1997 induction to the Columbus Hall of Fame.

 *Skip Spence    	
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Skip Spence, an original member of the rock  
band Jefferson Airplane, died Friday of lung cancer at age 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence's death came weeks before the release of ``More Oar,'' a  
CD tribute to Spence including songs by Beck, Robert Plant, Tom 
Waits and members of R.E.M. The recording was inspired by ``Oar,'' 
Spence's unique, folk-psychedelic solo album from 1969, which will 
soon be reissued. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence had long battled schizophrenia and alcoholism. He had  
been on a ventilator since entering the hospital April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, Alexander Lee ``Skip'' Spence, born in Ontario, Canada,  
was set to audition as a guitar player for the band Quicksilver 
Messenger Service when another musician, Marty Balin, invited him 
to play drums in his new band, Jefferson Airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence had never played drums before but learned quickly; on  
``Oar'' he plays every instrument. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence left Jefferson Airplane in 1966 and became a founding  
member of Moby Grape. Later, he gave another San Francisco Bay area 
band, Pud, a new name -- the Doobie Brothers.

<HEADLINE> TV-Bicycle Link-Up Battles Fat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents may have a way to budge their  
chip-chomping, TV-watching kids from the family sofa: a bicycle 
hooked up electrically to the set. To see their favorite shows, 
couch potatoes have to pedal. 
</P>
<P>
	An obesity researcher who came up with the ``TVcycle'' says  
early tryouts helped youngsters shed fat and discouraged TV 
viewing. 
</P>
<P>
	David Allison of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York knows  
parents are not going to race to rewire TV sets and he cautions 
that his findings are preliminary. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says his small study of a few overweight New York  
children is important because it suggests tinkering with the 
technology that makes life more comfortable -- but also more 
sedentary and fattening -- could help trim Americans' expanding 
waistlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not naive enough to think we're going to solve the  
world's obesity problems with TVs hooked to bicycles,'' Allison 
said. ``But there are other things we could do ... that are limited 
only by our imaginations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institutes of Health says about 55 percent of  
American adults are overweight or obese, up from 43 percent in 
1960. Studies also suggest more than 13 percent of youngsters ages 
6 through 17 are overweight, and getting fatter each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of exercise is a main cause.  
</P>
<P>
	Research shows television is a major culprit for kids,  
mesmerizing children who otherwise might burn calories while 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Formal exercise programs do not help much because it is hard to  
get to a gym or playground regularly, particularly for young 
children with busy parents, so scientists are hunting for 
home-based tricks to get kids moving, Allison said. 
</P>
<P>
	For his experiment, an engineer rewired TV sets to work only  
while the viewer was pedaling an attached bicycle. Built-in 
computers measure how long the televisions were on. The TVcycles, 
which are back in Allison's office as he hunts money for a larger 
study, are not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	With NIH funding, Allison delivered the TVcycles to six  
overweight TV fans, ages 8 to 12, and put standard exercise bikes 
in front of televisions for four similar children. 
</P>
<P>
	The kids did not diet and the televisions for the TVcycle group  
were locked to prevent cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody nagged the youngsters to pedal or lose weight, Allison  
said. ``We just said, 'Here you go. For the TV to work, you have to 
pedal. See ya,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten weeks later, the four kids who watched television while  
lolling on the couch saw 20 hours a week and bicyled only 8 minutes 
a week, Allison said in an interview Friday before presenting his 
results at a biology conference Sunday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The six TVcycle kids watched an hour a week and pedaled an hour  
a week. But that was not all the TVcycle kids watched. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not pedal when the family watched television together  
and there was some cheating, when parents lets kids watch a special 
show on a set not part of the test, Allison said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pedaling kids finished the study with 2 percentage  
points less total body fat and 3 percentage points less fat on 
their legs than the other children. So those kids must have been 
more active during the time once spent watching TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite amazing they'd see any change'' in such a short  
time and in kids who did not diet, said Michael Jacobson of the 
Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy 
group that fights obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison says the study shows scientists should look for  
innovative ways to encourage physical activity and better 
nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his more radical suggestions is charging a quarter to  
ride an elevator, which might leading more people to use the 
stairs.

<HEADLINE> Wood Frogs Return to Missouri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUREKA, Mo. (AP) -- Owen Sexton has done a lot of things in his  
71 years, but one of the things he is proudest of is the return of 
the wood frog to this part of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	What started as a pet project 20 years ago has turned into  
something of an accomplishment for the biologist at Washington 
University in St. Louis -- and all without huge grants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have been happy with just establishing a resident  
population in one little pond,'' Sexton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the amphibians spread to areas far removed from the  
pond that started it all in 1980. ``I think what we have shown is 
that species that had been virtually wiped out can come back, given 
the proper environment and a little luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Records indicate that the wood frog, Rana Sylvatica, was present  
in northern Missouri at the turn of the century, but was nearly 
absent in the region, which includes the St. Louis area, by 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The wood frog mates in small ponds for a week to 10 days each  
year. Females deposit eggs in egg masses in shallow water and the 
eggs hatch tadpoles that eventually lose their tails, grow legs and 
become frogs. Then they go off to live in the woods until it's time 
to mate again the following spring, usually in the same pond. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, the Missouri Department of Conservation located an  
isolated pond in Warren County in which wood frogs still mated. An 
agent collected an egg mass and delivered it to Sexton. Sexton 
placed the egg mass -- produced by a single female wood frog -- in a 
small pond at Washington University's Tyson Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The repopulation was on.  
</P>
<P>
	The frogs from that first batch thrived and expanded into areas  
around the center, even crossing Interstate 44 to take up residence 
on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea how they got across the highway,'' Sexton  
said. ``Just lucky, I guess. Or fast. We have talked to everyone we 
know to talk to -- the St. Louis Zoo, the Conservation Department -- 
and none of them had reintroduction programs going in that area. 
Those frogs had to have come from our pond. I call it 
serendipity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has figured that one out,'' agreed Steve Spezia,  
supervisor of the St. Louis Region of the Missouri Department of 
Conservation. ``But the frogs got there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through Owen's research and cooperation, we have established  
something that probably wouldn't have been there,'' said Spezia, 
who calls the biologist his mentor in the area of amphibians. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows why the frogs disappeared in the first place, but  
Sexton trots out the usual suspects: destruction of their 
environment by development and such seemingly harmless moves as 
stocking ponds with fish -- many of which feed on the amphibians in 
their larval stage and can wipe out entire populations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amphibians are on the decline in a large part of the world,''  
he said. ``It's no mystery. You can't build subdivisions without 
destroying ecosystems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lean, bearded professor has studied population dynamics of  
amphibians in the Cloud Forest of Venezuela and lived for a while 
with the Choco Indians of Panama in 1961 while assessing 
populations of amphibians near the site of the proposed Pan 
American Highway. 
</P>
<P>
	He has checked out anolis lizard populations in the wilds of  
Belize and searched for rattlesnake dens in the high plains of 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Sexton, who joined Washington University in 1955, also is a  
co-founder with ``Wild Kingdom'' founder Marlin Perkins of the Wild 
Canid Survival and Research Center. The center has succeeded in 
breeding Mexican gray wolves for reintroduction into the wild in 
Mexico and the southwestern United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tyson research center comprises about 2,000 acres of wooded  
land surrounded by another 5,500 acres of parkland. That much 
insulation from the rapidly developing, surrounding suburban areas 
provides Sexton the isolation needed for his research. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent spring-like day, Sexton guided a reporter up a  
gravel track to a shallow vernal pool. Such ponds typically fill up 
during the winter and spring and then dry up as the summer 
progresses. Even the ones that remain year-round are too shallow to 
support fish. 
</P>
<P>
	On this day, about 100 male wood frogs about 2 inches long swam  
on the surface, trying to attract females with croaks that sounded 
more like the quacking of ducks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a good population this year,'' said Sexton as he  
walked carefully around the edges of the pond, peering into the 
clear water. He pointed out fist-sized wood frog egg masses that 
appeared blue-black in the water. Farther down the bank he spotted 
a fluorescent green lump that was a salamander egg mass covered 
with a warming blanket of algae. 
</P>
<P>
	The algae thrives on the egg mass and provides oxygen and food  
to the growing creatures inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a week, he said, the adult frogs would be gone from the  
pond, having moved back into the woods where they live most of the 
year, eating insects, earthworms and even other small frogs and 
being eaten by herons, hawks, fish, mink and raccoons. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are an important link in the food chain,'' said Sexton,  
``when there are enough of them. You can often determine how robust 
an ecosystem is not by the number of species, but by the number of 
individuals within a species. And there are now a lot of wood frogs 
out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around the pond is a ``drift fence,'' which funnels small  
creatures into buckets for counting as they try to get to the pond. 
Sexton says he believes most of the frogs and salamanders that mate 
in the pond go there on one night in a mass migration from an area 
of about 100 meters around the pond. 
</P>
<P>
	The count this year indicated seven species of frogs and three  
kinds of salamanders had headed for the pond. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bomb Threat Disrupts Maine Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUNSWICK, Maine (AP) -- A single phone call just after midnight  
turned this town upside down for a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone called police to say there was a bomb in the local high  
school. Less than an hour later, officer Mark Lafountain could hear 
his heart pounding as he and several bomb-sniffing dogs were 
inching through the dimly lit school. 
</P>
<P>
	No bomb was found. But the threat alone shut down the town's six  
schools for the day, forcing parents to scramble for day care and 
tacking an extra school day onto the summer holiday for 3,322 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	That was one of at least six bomb scares at Maine schools over  
the past month -- reflecting a problem across the country. Mindful 
of terrorist attacks and recent school violence, authorities can no 
longer consider bomb threats as mere crank calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the significant levels of violence that our public  
schools have experienced for the past year and a half, it has 
dramatically changed the way threats are being handled,'' said 
Ronald Stephens at the National School Safety Center near Los 
Angeles. ``Threats can no longer be taken lightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In East Montpelier, Vt., educators got so fed up after seven  
bomb threats at a high school that they decided to rethink the 
policy of canceling school. Instead, school was moved outside. 
Lunch was served from trucks and portable toilets lined the 
athletic field. 
</P>
<P>
	After five threats in two weeks last fall, Fort Dodge Senior  
High School in Iowa began requiring that materials be delivered in 
clear containers. Students are greeted by two guards posted at the 
building's only entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland's Anne Arundel County, hundreds of students phoned  
in or posted bogus bomb threats, forcing nearly daily evacuations. 
Now callers to at least one Annapolis high school are greeted by a 
warning that calls may be recorded or traced. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, the Lower Camden County Regional School District  
adopted a tough expulsion policy last year after it had 50 hoaxes 
at its four schools. Criminal charges have been filed against 27 
people, including 24 students. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no precise figures on the number of bomb threats at  
schools because educators are not required to report such 
incidents, said Michael Higgins, special programs coordinator for 
the Maine Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if there is no bomb to go with a threat, it's still a  
headache for authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge disruption in the normal course of business,''  
said Brunswick Police Chief Jerry Hinton. ``This just isn't kids 
out of school for a day. You can't put a dollar figure on it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In Brunswick, Lafountain and the dogs had to check out the  
entire school, including lockers, ceiling tiles and the noisy 
boiler room. 
</P>
<P>
	He could not turn on the lights, nor could he use radio  
communications, because of fears that electricity or radio waves 
could set off an explosive device. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening classroom doors was terrifying.  
</P>
<P>
	``You always wonder if it's booby trapped,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Suns Honor Chambers Role in Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Tom Chambers, who came to the Phoenix Suns in  
1988 as the NBA's first unrestricted free agent, was honored today 
as the player who became the foundation of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the cornerstone of the building we're in right now,''  
former Suns coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said during a halftime 
ceremony at America West Arena. ``Without him, we couldn't have 
been successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers' five children were part of the ceremony during the  
game between Seattle and Phoenix. So were Suns owner Jerry 
Colangelo and Kevin Johnson, the point guard who dished so many of 
his assists to Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been together a long time,'' Johnson said after the  
ceremony. ``Fortunately for us, Tom and I have been able to express 
how we feel toward one another over the years. A moment like this 
just gave everybody else a chance to hear it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers played five seasons for the Suns during his 16-year NBA  
career, averaging 20.6 points and six rebounds per game. In his 
first two seasons with the Suns, he averaged 27.2 points and 25.7 
points, still the highest two averages in the team's history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had so much fun here,'' said Chambers, who serves as a  
special assistant coach and community relations representative for 
the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers had 20,049 points in his NBA career, 24th on the  
all-time list. He was in the All-Star Game three times as a Sun. In 
1987, the year before he came to Phoenix, he scored 34 points and 
was the game's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	He rattled off the names of some of his Phoenix teammates,  
including Eddie Johnson, Jeff Hornacek and Dan Majerle. He had 
special praise for Johnson, who likely will someday have his name 
up with Chambers and the other in the new ``Ring of Honor'' at 
America West. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers called Johnson ``the guy who made me the player I am. I  
couldn't have done it without K.J.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo presented Chambers with a custom-made saddle, told him  
he was getting a new trail horse to go with it, along with a new 
pickup truck and a statue commemorating Chambers' memorable slam 
dunk over Mark Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers came to Phoenix at a crucial time for what was then a  
shaky franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order for us to go from 28 wins one year to 55 the  
following season, you'd better have a very good ball player, and we 
had one in Tom Chambers,'' Fitzsimmons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the other five players in the Suns' ``Ring of Honor''  
were on hand for the event -- Alvan Adams, Walter Davis, Dick Van 
Arsdale and Paul Westphal, who was there as Seattle's coach. The 
only one missing was Connie Hawkins, who is in Bosnia on a goodwill 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Westphal said Chambers thrived in Phoenix because the Suns  
encouraged him to take as many shots as he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people called him selfish, saying he wanted to shoot all  
the time,'' said Westphal, who was a teammate of Chambers and later 
an assistant coach. ``But when that's what you do best, you should 
shoot all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were happy when he shot, and he was happy when he shot.''  
</P>
<P>
	Chambers had a special thanks for the fans who cheered him on,  
first at the old Veterans Memorial Coliseum and then at America 
West Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are the greatest,'' Chambers told them. ``From day one you  
embraced me. You loved me. You loved the team. You bought the 
tickets to build this arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers' No. 24 wasn't officially retired because it's worn by  
the Suns' Tom Gugliotta.

<HEADLINE>  Africans Sweep the London Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Africans swept the London Marathon today, with  
Joyce Chepchumba of Kenya setting a world record. 
</P>
<P>
	Sort of.  
</P>
<P>
	While Abdelkader El Mouaziz became the first Morrocan to win the  
race, finishing in 2 hours, 7 minutes, 57 seconds, Chepchumba 
captured the women's division for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	She was timed in 2 hours, 23 minutes, 22 seconds and earned  
$230,000, which included bonus money for a world mark recognized by 
the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Her time actually was the 12th fastest by a woman and later in  
the day became the 13th after Tegla Loroupe of Kenya ran 2:22.49 in 
Rotterdam, Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Chepchumba's time also was more than 2:30 slower that Loroupe's  
official world record of 2:20.47 set at Rotterdam last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the leading marks all were set in mixed races, where the  
women have the advantage of running alongside the faster men. 
</P>
<P>
	The women in the London Marathon start a half hour early so they  
won't be affected by the men's race. Organizers offered a bonus of 
$125,000 for anyone beating Lidia Simon's mark of 2:23.24, which 
was set by the Romanian in a women's-only race at Osaka, Japan, in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Chepchumba also collected $55,000 for winning the race, $25,000  
more for a course record and a $25,000 time bonus for finishing 
inside 2:24.00. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I'll buy a new dress,'' Chepchumba said after learning  
of her $230,000 payday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Kenyan mother, who is a close friend of  
Loroupe's, said she believed she deserved the bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the men run with the women you get a better time,'' she  
said. ``But I think it's better for the women to run on their 
own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manuela Machado, a Portuguese world champion marathon runner who  
placed third behind Chepchumba and Adriana Fernandez of Mexico, 
agreed the Loroupe's performance in Rotterdam last year was not as 
good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that Joyce's time is more special,'' she said.  
``When Tegla ran in Rotterdam she had two pacemakers. I value 
Joyce's time better than Tegla's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez placed second in 2:24.06 and Machado was third in  
2:25.09 but neither could stay with Chepchumba. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenyan hit the front three miles from home to maintain her  
remarkable record in the race. Her finishing positions in the four 
London Marathons are second in 1996, first in '97, third last year 
and now a winner again. 
</P>
<P>
	El Mouaziz, who led last year's race until fading to second,  
stayed close to the leaders of the strong field before breaking 
away with nine miles to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moroccan was never threatened and missed the course record  
by a second. Two-time champion Antonio Pinto of Portugal was 
second, 1:03 behind, and defending champ Abel Anton of Spain third 
in 2:09.41. 
</P>
<P>
	World record-holder Ronaldo Da Costs of Brazil was 17th, more  
than eight minutes slower than his mark of 2:06.05 set in Berlin 
last year. Olympic champion Josia Thugwane, who was among the 
leaders for half the race, dropped out at 22 miles when he 
developed a cough. 
</P>
<P>
	El Mouaziz, who slowed to wave several times to the crowd in the  
final 200 yards, didn't realize he was so close to the course 
record, which would have earned him an extra $25,000 to go with his 
$55,000 for finishing first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sharing my victory with the people and I did not watch  
the time,'' he said. ``I was so happy. That's why I lost the time 
and the big money.''

</P>
<P>
	Chepcumba shaved two seconds off the time owned by Lidia Simon  
and set in Osaka, Japan, in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there are 11 faster times among women, organizers of  
the London Marathon recognize it as the world's best because it was 
set in a women-only race. The other times were set in races that 
had a men's event as well and would have influenced the times. 
</P>
<P>
	Adriana Fernandez of Mexico placed second in 2:24.06 and world  
champion Manuela Machado of Portugal was third in 2:25.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Tegla Loroupe of Kenya, the woman who holds the world mark  
recognized by the International Amateur Athletic Federation, was 
running in Rotterdam and won in 2:22.49, the year's fastest time.

<HEADLINE> Theme Parks Voting on Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- With the help of television's ``Odd  
Couple'' and Edith Bunker, the actors, dancers, singers and stunt 
people at Universal Studios Escape are preparing to vote this week 
on whether to organize at the resort's two theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	With a diverse work force that is expected to grow to 16,000  
people by the end of summer, Universal has been the No. 1 target 
for organized labor here. A victory could bring in resources from 
international labor groups to organize other parts of the theme 
park resort's expanding work force, and eventually other parts of 
Orlando's hospitality industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other top tourist destinations, such as Las Vegas and New  
York, unions in Orlando have a weak hold over the area's tourism 
industry. Only two major segments of Orlando's $16 billion tourism 
industry, Walt Disney World and the Orange County Convention 
Center, are organized. Tourism-related jobs account for about 
one-fifth of all jobs in the Orlando area. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials, however, are confident the Actors' Equity  
Association can pull off a victory on Friday when 300 Universal 
performers vote. Actors' Equity was soundly defeated in 1992 during 
its last attempt to unionize, but this time around the union has 
taken a slower, grassroots approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very much anticipating Equity's success and looking  
forward to the buzz that will be created by that,'' said Brian 
Lawlor, business representative for the International Alliance of 
Theatrical Stage Employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certain that a victory would initiate more campaigns,''  
said Harvey Totzke, president of the Service Trades Council Union, 
a coalition of six unions representing everything from cooks to 
drivers to costumed characters. ``That certainly opens the door for 
future organizing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actors Equity has enlisted the help of some well-known  
personalities. Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, stars of ``The Odd 
Couple,'' and Jean Stapleton, who played Edith Bunker on ``All in 
the Family,'' are the celebrity draws to an Equity-sponsored gala 
for Universal performers tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	But Universal isn't giving in without a fight.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that unions are divisive. I believe they build a  
wall between management and workers,'' said Tom Williams, Universal 
Studios Escape's president and chief executive. ``The workers are 
very smart and very capable of expressing their point of view ... 
They don't need to have a middle person or a third party 
interpreting or talking for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park performers have been required to go to meetings where they  
listen to Universal executives lecture on the disadvantages of 
joining a union. 
</P>
<P>
	The union gets no similar face-to-face time with performers and  
is relying on direct mailings to spread its message. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus of the Actors' Equity campaign has been the guarantee  
of safe and healthy working conditions, such as clean costumes, dry 
stages and more dress rehearsals, rather than on traditional issues 
of wages and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Working for Universal isn't a bad thing. We're not talking  
about some evil ogre,'' said Doug Truelsen, who earns $16.40 as an 
actor at Universal Studios' Hercules and Xena attraction and is a 
member of the union's organizing committee. ``We just want 
guarantees of things they say we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Universal is opening a second theme park, Islands of Adventure,  
next month and recently opened a nightlife entertainment complex, 
CityWalk. A new hotel is scheduled to open later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The larger they get, the more costly it is to organize it,''  
Hall said. ``It's now or never.''

<HEADLINE> Rebuilt German Reichstag Is To Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- What hasn't happened to the Reichstag?  
</P>
<P>
	It was burned during the Nazis, bombed by the Allies, and  
stormed by Red Army soldiers who scrawled obscenities on the walls 
and planted the red Soviet flag on the roof, marking the defeat of 
Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
	East Germany built the Berlin Wall just a few steps from its  
back door. And after the Wall came down, the artist Christo wrapped 
the Reichstag in a million square feet of silvery fabric, a 
celebration of the end of communism. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the old parliament has undergone yet another transformation.  
</P>
<P>
	After a $330 million renovation, the Reichstag debuts Monday as  
the reclaimed seat of German lawmakers, a defining episode in the 
government's return this year to the prewar capital of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	More than any other building in the city, the Reichstag  
(pronounced RIKES-tahg) has symbolized every phase of Germany's 
turbulent, terrible history over the past 80 years. So it only 
seems fitting that in his restoration, celebrated British architect 
Sir Norman Foster has made the Reichstag into a new symbol for the 
new capital, one of a Germany mindful of the past but moving 
confidently into the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster preserved the Reichstag's original 19th-century facade,  
with its Italian Renaissance-style columns and carvings, and the 
inscription over the main entrance: ``To the German People.'' But 
he also gave the parliament a new glass dome that bursts from the 
top of the old, ravaged building and sparkles like a beacon on the 
city horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, almost everything is new: the central parliament  
chamber, the offices and meeting rooms, the five new restaurants, 
the sleek furniture, the gray decor accented with primary colors 
and pastels. All the modernness only emphasizes the wartime scars 
the architect left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Take the east wing, where Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has an  
office. Doors along the hallway are bright blue, with shiny steel 
handles and hinges, but sections of the white, stone walls are 
still gouged and jagged from bombings and covered with Russian 
graffiti -- names and rude slogans dated ``1945.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of events have passed over that building and left their  
imprint on the fabric,'' says Foster, who took journalists on a 
preview tour last week. ``I think it has more integrity to reveal 
and accept the history, making it tangibly visible for present and 
future generations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The architectural mix of old and new in large part embodies the  
professed spirit of Schroeder's center-left government. His 
so-called Berlin Republic stresses that enough time has passed for 
Germany to be powerful without being threatening, that it can 
remember its crimes without being defined by guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an attitude that comes partly from Schroeder himself. The  
chancellor, 55, is the first from a generation untroubled by 
memories of Hitler. But it also comes from the government's return 
to Berlin, scene of Prussian imperialism and Third Reich horrors. 
In the planning since 1991, one year after Germany's reunification, 
the move this year sets a major milestone in the success and 
confidence of German democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's ceremony opening the Reichstag is the first key event  
in the move from Bonn, the provincial southwestern city where the 
capital was relegated after World War II. Next comes the election 
of a new German president in May and the new parliamentary session 
in September -- the first to start in the restored building. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember how from East Berlin, you could see the Reichstag  
so near and yet so far,'' parliamentary President Wolfgang Thierse, 
an east German, told German radio. ``Even then it represented a 
longing for unity, freedom and democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	German democracy actually comes full circle with the reopening  
of the Reichstag, which was built in 1894 to house the first German 
parliament, an attempt to install elements of democracy under 
Kaiser Wilhelm. Real democracy took hold -- however briefly -- after 
World War I, when the empire was abolished. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a return to the building's original purpose,'' says  
historian Brian Ladd, author of a book about Berlin architecture. 
``Some may see this as an attempt to pretend the intervening years 
never happened. But I think it shows that German democracy has 
earned the right to confront its past and live with it. And that 
includes the Third Reich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitler never governed -- never even spoke -- in the Reichstag, but  
the building nonetheless represents the Nazis by association. All 
the grim history raised concerns about whether Germany should 
return to Berlin, the seat of power at its most terrifying. 
</P>
<P>
	But the transformed Reichstag is as light as its legacy is dark.  
Glass walls around the central parliament and a viewing platform on 
the second floor mean visitors can see and hear what's going on 
inside. The feel is one of openness, of a transparent and 
accessible government.

<HEADLINE> BoxCar Willie Mourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- BoxCar Willie's last appearance drew a full  
house. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 people filled the entertainer's theater Saturday to  
say goodbye to America's singing hobo. BoxCar Willie, whose given 
name was Lecil Travis Martin, died Monday of leukemia at age 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the mourners were Branson stars such as Mel Tillis, Andy  
Williams, Jim Stafford and Yakov Smirnoff. And nearly each one had 
a warm memory to share about the friend they called ``Box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tillis recalled serving in the Air Force with him in Nebraska 45  
years ago: ``I was a baker and he was a flight engineer. He used to 
come by the place where I did my baking, and we'd sit on the flour 
sacks and pick our guitars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Cliff Braschler's eulogy was interspersed with video  
clips from shows, and many mourners wept and then smiled as they 
heard songs like ``The Wabash Cannonball'' and ``I've Seen It All 
From a Boxcar Door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braschler let BoxCar Willie have the last word, and the crowd  
heard him sing: 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll ride that last train to heaven, on rails of solid gold,  
</P>
<P>
	``In a boxcar filled with satin, where the nights are never  
cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where the hobo's always welcome, even in his raggedy clothes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll ride that last train to heaven, when the final whistle  
blows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, hundreds filed past an open coffin to view the  
performer in his full hobo regalia, an American flag at his side. 
An Air Force color guard honored BoxCar Willie at a brief graveside 
service.

<HEADLINE> Everyone's a Winner in NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nobody, of course, did badly in this weekend's  
NFL draft. Everyone got just the players they wanted, and everyone 
will be better next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Except Cleveland, which didn't have a last season.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were a good football team coming in,'' coach Mike Shanahan  
of the two- time Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos said Sunday. 
``We got a lot more depth, we got a lot more team speed. Overall, I 
feel like it was an excellent draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone else feels that way now -- from the New Orleans Saints,  
who became the first team in draft history to have just one pick to 
the Washington Redskins. They took advantage of Mike Ditka's 
generosity, got just what they wanted, cornerback Champ Bailey and 
have three No. 1s next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Reality?  
</P>
<P>
	Wait two or three years.  
</P>
<P>
	Some strange things happened, the strangest Ditka's trade for  
that wound up netting Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Orleans coach, who has a decent defense, believes the  
Heisman-winning running back can take a 6-10 team to the playoffs, 
playing the same role Walter Payton did with Ditka's Chicago Bears 
15 years ago. But all Ditka has at quarterback are career backups 
in the Billy Joes (Hobert and Tolliver), and there's very little 
speed at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there were the New York Giants, with a history this decade  
of awful first-round picks and great ones down the draft -- Jason 
Sehorn and Michael Strahan (2nd round), Charles Way (6th) and 
Jessie Armstead (8th). 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, they used the 19th overall pick on offensive  
lineman Luke Petitgout of Notre Dame, who most scouts had as a 
second-rounder. Perhaps they felt they had done so well in the 
second round that they'd take a second-rounder No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth round on Sunday, the Giants took running back Sean  
Bennett of Northwestern, who was listed as ``not draftable'' in the 
only scouting guide that even rated him. New York used nine picks 
on relatively obscure or flawed players. 
</P>
<P>
	What does that mean?  
</P>
<P>
	Probably nothing. The Giants were so sure of their picks that it  
took them just 34 seconds to take Petitgout and 18 to choose Ohio 
State running back Joe Montgomery, who has a history of knee 
injuries, at No. 2 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected you to be shocked,'' general manager Ernie Accorsi  
told the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, it was one of the strangest drafts of recent years.  
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second in NFL history when quarterbacks went  
1-2-3 -- Tim Couch of Kentucky to expansion Cleveland, Donovan 
McNabb to Philadelphia (roundly booed by Philly fans who wanted 
Williams) and Akili Smith to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals also drafted a QB, Miami's Scott Covington, in the  
seventh round, giving them six on their roster -- Jeff Blake, Neil 
O'Donnell, Paul Justin and Eric Kresser are the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Five quarterbacks were drafted in the first round and 13 overall  
-- the first- round haul was the biggest since 1983, when John 
Elway, Dan Marino and Jim Kelly were among the picks. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were 26 trades during the draft, most by teams moving  
up and down a few places to get a player they craved, even on a 
late round. 
</P>
<P>
	The most interesting picks of the second day were running back  
Cecil Collins by Miami in the fifth round; quarterback Michael 
Bishop by New England and safety Anthony Poindexter by Baltimore in 
the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins has played five college games, three at LSU and two at  
McNeese State. He was kicked off the team in both places. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the draft, he received four years probation after  
pleading guilty to two misdemeanors and two felonies for breaking 
into two apartments and fondling two women. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami coach Jimmy Johnson was known to want him and turned it  
into a no-lose situation to wait until the fifth round to grab a 
back who in three games at LSU in 1997 ran for 583 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins hope Collins can emulate the feats of Minnesota  
wide receiver Randy Moss, who fell to 21st overall last season 
because of off-field problems. He ended up All-Pro and the 
offensive rookie of the year.. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is giving people second chances. If they don't do  
what's right we go on with our business,'' said Johnson, who said 
Collins reminds him of ``a faster Emmitt Smith.'' ``He's a risk. 
That's why we waited until the fifth round. Everyone in the league 
wanted to take him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poindexter, a safety from Virginia, would have been a high  
first-round pick if he hadn't suffered a horrific knee injury last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop, who almost led historically downtrodden Kansas State to  
the national championship game, was runner-up to Williams for the 
Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	He has perhaps the best arm of any quarterback in the draft, and  
is one of the best athletes. But most scouts don't think he's ready 
to read NFL defenses, and some teams viewed him as a wide receiver 
or running back. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Pete Carroll, however, hinted he might use him as a  
``Slash,'' as Pittsburgh used Kordell Stewart before he became the 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can give us a change of pace,'' Carroll said. ``We would  
like to put Michael Bishop in a position where he can run.''

	NATO Reports Serbian Atrocities  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO on Saturday disclosed what it  
said was more proof of atrocities by Serb forces in Kosovo, showing 
reporters aerial photos of what it claimed may be up to 150 fresh 
graves near the town of Izbica. ``It's clear that there is mounting 
evidence of detentions, summary executions and mass graves,'' NATO 
spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters. Shea said that based on 
refugee accounts, about 3,200 ethnic Albanians had been slain by 
Serbs in the province in the past several weeks. He stressed the 
figures could not be verified, but added ``a great deal of killing 
has been taking place in Kosovo.''

	Future of Captured Soldiers Mulled  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. military leaders mulled what to do with a  
Yugoslav prisoner of war Saturday, but it appeared unlikely that 
the lieutenant would be traded for three American soldiers seized 
near the Macedonian border two weeks ago. ``I would not be 
optimistic on that score,'' said Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday, a 
Pentagon spokesman. Meanwhile, a Pentagon briefer said the F-16 
pilot who discussed his attack on a convoy did not accidentally 
bomb refugees, as NATO had suggested in releasing an audiotape of 
his account.

	GOP Pushes Lower Taxes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican-led budget plan passed by  
Congress would cut most Americans' taxes while spending more on 
Social Security, education and national defense, GOP Sen. Spencer 
Abraham said Saturday. The $1.74 trillion spending plan for the 
fiscal year starting Oct. 1 places overall limits on the detailed 
tax and spending bills lawmakers will write, then try to persuade 
the White House to accept. Congress passed the legislation 
Thursday. The Michigan Republican, delivering the GOP's weekly 
radio address, said the party's agenda ``will help our families and 
our children face the future with optimism and confidence.''

	LONDON (AP) -- A bomb fired nails through a crowded street market  
in south London Saturday, injuring at least 48 people, police said. 
No one was killed, but Scotland Yard said four people had been 
seriously injured in the explosion. There was no report of anyone 
claiming responsibility. Press Association, the British news 
agency, said police sources suggested the explosion was related to 
criminal activity and not to politically motivated terrorism.

	Fire Threat Continues in Florida

	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- Long-awaited rains appeared to  
dampen some brush fires and dust-dry forests Saturday, but Florida 
officials still issued a warning that more fires were likely on 
Sunday. Earlier Saturday, 10 tractor plow operators from the Texas 
Forest Service arrived to help fight the fires that have scorched 
spots across the Sunshine State for weeks. The extra equipment is 
expected to be used to fight fires like the 50,000-acre blaze

the air raids on hills near the village of Zebqine, north of the 
Israeli-occupied enclave. A military spokesman in Jerusalem said 
Israeli jets attacked guerrilla targets in the area and returned 
safely to base.

America's singing hobo. Among the mourners who crowded in to the

<HEADLINE> Musician Skip Spence Dies at 52 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Skip Spence, an original member of the rock  
band Jefferson Airplane, has died of lung cancer at 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence died Friday at Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz, where he  
had been fighting a number of ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	His death came weeks before the release of ``More Oar,'' a CD  
tribute to Spence including songs by Beck, Robert Plant, Tom Waits 
and members of R.E.M. The recording was inspired by ``Oar,'' 
Spence's unique, folk-psychedelic solo album from 1969, which will 
soon be reissued. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence had long battled schizophrenia and alcoholism. He had  
been on a ventilator since entering the hospital April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, Alexander Lee ``Skip'' Spence, born in Ontario, Canada,  
was set to audition as a guitar player for Quicksilver Messenger 
Service when another local musician, Marty Balin, invited him to 
play drums in his new band, Jefferson Airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence had never played drums before but learned quickly; on  
``Oar'' he plays every instrument. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence left the Jefferson Airplane in 1966 and became a founding  
member of Moby Grape. Later, he gave another San Francisco Bay area 
band, Pud, a new name -- the Doobie Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include four children.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Calls Hockey 'a Hard Game' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky left hockey the way he came in:  
head held high and the right side of his jersey still tucked into 
the corner of his pants. 
</P>
<P>
	That bit of tailoring was a habit born of necessity, the only  
way a scrawny kid routinely playing in leagues against kids four 
and five years older could keep the too-big jerseys he always wore 
from getting in his way. 
</P>
<P>
	What changed between then and now is that when Gretzky stepped  
off the rink Sunday, Gretzky was four and five years older than 
anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only am I mentally ready to retire, I'm physically ready  
to retire, too. This is a great game,'' he said, ``but it's a hard 
game, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody said goodbye in their own way.  
</P>
<P>
	Six-year-old Trevor Gretzky skipped his Little League game to  
see the old man off after all. Michael Jordan called during 
breakfast. People rushing to Madison Square Garden in Rangers 
jerseys with ``99'' stitched on the back crossed against the light 
in Times Square without getting run down. 
</P>
<P>
	For one afternoon at least, the game with a tough reputation and  
the town with an even tougher one were awash in sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
	National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman retired his  
number. Teammates gave him a large-screen TV. The Rangers gave him 
a Mercedes-Benz. The P.A. system played every mushy song ever 
recorded. The crowd of 18,200 stood as one nearly every time the 
puck turned up on the blade of his stick. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody came bearing gifts for The Great One it seemed, except  
the Pittsburgh Penguins. And even the villains in the 1,487th and 
final game of Gretzky's career were helpless to stop him from 
picking up assist No. 1,963 on a nifty forehand pass that led to 
the Rangers' only goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins did win a measure of revenge -- and a place in the  
trivia trove of hockey -- with a 2-1 victory on a goal by Jaromir 
Jagr in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jagr said to me he didn't mean to do it,'' Gretzky said  
afterward. ``That's what I used to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even that couldn't take the luster off his day.  
</P>
<P>
	The puck had barely rippled the chords of the Rangers' net when  
Jagr, heir apparent to Gretzky's crown as the best in the game, led 
his teammates in forming a receiving line to shake The Great One's 
hand. Countless hugs, three curtain calls and several tearful laps 
of the arena later, Gretzky was gone, though a final set of 
fingerprints lingered. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game the Rangers painted ``99'' on the ice between  
the nets and the backboards on both ends to recognize the space 
Gretzky called his ``office'' -- the place where he dished out 
literally hundreds of assists. Earlier, on his third shift of the 
opening period, he set up shop there and two Penguins, defenseman 
Kevin Hatcher and right wing Alexei Kovalev, materialized on either 
side of the net, hoping to hem Gretzky in. 
</P>
<P>
	He began stickhandling, shifting the puck from backhand to  
forehand, keeping it tantalizingly out of the reach of both 
players. Neither dared lunge at him, maybe because they had seen 
the same replays everyone else had hundreds of times: Gretzky 
threading a lethal pass through the narrowest of openings; Gretzky 
delicately flipping the puck over the net, off the back of the 
goalkeeper, and into the net; Gretzky spotting an onrushing 
teammate and caroming the puck off the corner boards, the way a 
pool hustler might. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins, as it turned out, dodged the bullet that time and  
on another dozen opportunities like it. Gretzky kept setting up 
teammates; they kept failing to finish. But every time he did so 
was one more reminder that the game really does slow down for the 
great ones, that they know not just where everything would happen, 
but where it would happen next. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that surprised Gretzky all afternoon happened  
with 30 seconds left in the game. John Muckler, the Ranger coach 
who had been an assistant when Gretzky broke in with the Edmonton 
Oilers some 15 years ago, called a timeout with the score tied 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``John's got a daughter that's about to give birth in Edmonton  
... and he said, `I've got to tell you something. I just had a 
grandson today. And now you got to get the winner,''' Gretzky 
recalled. ``And maybe when I was younger, I might have got it for 
him. I didn't today, so maybe that's why it's the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the right time, but not because of that.  
</P>
<P>
	It was right because Gretzky walked into the Garden this morning  
accompanied by the father who taught him the responsibility that 
came with having a gift, and he walked out hours later with his 
wife, his daughter and two sons of his own, old enough now to 
understand that their father had been equal to the task.

<HEADLINE> 'Melrose Place' Crew Saves Water </HEADLINE>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Melrose Place'' is going off the air this

show -- a vial of water taken from the pool of the famous TV 
apartment complex. 
</P>

	In its April 24 issue, TV Guide reports that crew members filled  
up jugs of water from the Melrose pool, the site of much cavorting 
among the show's characters.

<HEADLINE> 'Great' Gretzky Plays Last NHL Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There were four laps around the rink, tears and  
a simple wave -- and then he was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Gretzky ended his NHL career on Sunday to rousing cheers  
and endless chants from an overflow crowd at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Smiling through his tears, the greatest player ever made it easy  
for everyone to say goodbye -- skating around the arena slowly 
enough for plenty of souvenir photos to be taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Better still, he touched youngsters' hands every time he noticed  
them extended from the crowd. He even played to the adoring fans, 
donning a blue Yankees hat, then a red Rangers beret. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky skated one lap around the rink with teammates in tow,  
then came an encore, as a lone spotlight followed him around the 
ice and Carly Simon's ``Nobody Does It Better'' blared throughout. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most excruciating moment for him came as he fought  
the tears, occasionally looking down at the ice, while posing for 
one last photo with teammates, who all wore No. 99 caps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm devastated I will no longer be a hockey player,'' Gretzky  
said. ``I will miss every part of the game, because I loved every 
part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I've made the right decision.''  
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky ended his career with an assist, setting up a  
second-period goal as his New York Rangers lost to Pittsburgh 2-1 
in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	On the final shift of his 21-year pro career, with all the fans  
on their feet cheering as if a Stanley Cup title was imminent, 
Gretzky did nothing special. That was rare, particularly on this 
day -- when he set up a dozen good scoring chances -- and for his 
unparalleled career. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Rangers timeout with 40.4 seconds to go in the third  
period, his wife, Janet, began to cry as the fans began the long, 
final salute to The Great One. Gretzky acknowledged it with a nod, 
then a wave, then by raising his stick in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, he nearly had a breakaway, but Pittsburgh goalie  
Tom Barrasso, who had a sensational game, beat Gretzky to the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost fittingly, as if his career just wasn't supposed to end  
now, the game went into overtime. But it ended abruptly when 
Jaromir Jagr, hockey's dominant player these days, scored. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd and the Rangers seemed stunned, but only momentarily.  
Then everyone remembered why they'd come to an otherwise pedestrian 
matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	As the ``Gretz-ky'' chants began again, he skated over to the  
Penguins, who were lined up at the blue line, and shook hands with 
several. Then he hugged Jagr -- an unofficial passing of the torch? 
-- before returning to his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Then began the final moments of the Gretzky era, which NHL  
commissioner Gary Bettman ensured would end historically by 
announcing that no one will ever again wear No. 99 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the first of several times Gretzky became teary. It  
happened again when his father, Walter, was driven to center ice in 
a new black Mercedes presented to Gretzky as a parting gift. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel so lucky to be able to play in the NHL,'' the sport's  
greatest player said. ``I've been so fortunate to play with some of 
the greatest players, against guys I admired so much, like the best 
player I ever played against Mario Lemieux ... my teammates and, of 
course, the best player I ever played with, Mark Messier. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it would be nothing without family and the great  
friendships I have developed over the years. I appreciate all the 
accolades. I tell everyone the greatest place to play is right here 
in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who announced his retirement Friday, wore a huge grin  
as friend Bryan Adams sang ``O, Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss you, Wayne,'' Adams ad-libbed late in the  
song. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star-Spangled Banner,'' as sung by John Amirante, was  
altered to include the words ``in the land of Wayne Gretzky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who holds or shares 61 NHL records, set up Brian  
Leetch, John MacLean and Niklas Sundstrom for first-period scoring 
chances. All failed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first television timeout, Gordie Howe -- whose records  
Gretzky regularly broke -- appeared in a video, saluting his 
prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sports king, Michael Jordan, appeared in a second-period  
video, telling Gretzky, ``Your golf game is not going to get 
better, so don't think that will help. It will probably get worse, 
because you've got more time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, he set up MacLean for a semi-breakaway, but  
Barrasso stopped a slap shot. Then Gretzky broke in on a 2-on-1 
with MacLean, who held the puck too long for a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the Rangers were able to convert his magic. On a power  
play while trailing 1-0, Gretzky passed from the right wing boards 
to Mathieu Schneider in the slot. He faked a shot and passed to 
Leetch for a tap-in open-net goal. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to a mob scene at the sideboards as his teammates  
hugged, although Gretzky didn't seem very emotional. Of course, 
he'd done this 2,856 times before in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Something he'd rarely done, wince in embarrassment, might have  
been appropriate midway through the third period. The scoreboard 
showed a clip from a television special on which Gretzky sang -- 
sort of -- ``The Devil Went Down to Georgia.'' Everyone on both 
benches watched the video, but they all had the good sense not to 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	The first ovation, when Gretzky was introduced by master of  
ceremonies John Davidson, was accompanied by a three-minute salute 
that seemed to make the man of the moment most uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he skated to the Penguins bench and shared hugs and  
handshakes with several players as the rhythmic applause continued. 
He even pointed to the crowd at banners that said ``Thanks for the 
Memories,'' ``Always in Our Hearts: No. 99'' and ``Gretzky the 
Greatest Forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his family standing at center ice, along with teammates  
Leetch, Adam Graves and Jeff Beukeboom, Edmonton Oilers president 
Glen Sather was introduced. Gretzky shared a hug with his former 
coach, and then did the same with Lemieux, who retired in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, Canada's greatest sports hero, left Edmonton in 1988  
when he was traded to Los Angeles. He said goodbye to Hollywood in 
1996, dealt to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came to the Rangers -- already hockey's biggest star  
everywhere else -- he rejoined Messier, who was New York's leader 
and had helped the team win its first Stanley Cup in 54 years. When 
Gretzky left Sunday, Messier was on hand, too, and they stood 
together soaking up the biggest cheers of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to be on the ice with him again,'' Gretzky said.  
``He came here and showed people you can handle the pressure, which 
is something we loved to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everywhere at the Garden, fans wore No. 99 Rangers jerseys.  
Painted behind each net was a blue 99, so appropriate for the area 
known as ``Gretzky's office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A pregame light show featured spinning 99s projected onto the  
ice along with Gretzky's image; a short video of his career, also 
shown on the rink surface; and even a taped scoreboard message from 
The Great One thanking the fans for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne's father, who built an ice rink in the back yard ``for  
self-preservation -- I would freeze when I took him to skate on the 
ponds'' -- expects his son to make a clean break from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first few months, he's going to play golf,'' Walter  
Gretzky said. ``I know he'll never be a coach or general manager; 
they have the tough jobs. TV? I doubt that very much. You have to 
be at a certain place at a certain time, and he didn't even play 
the game that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He played the way nobody ever has. Or might ever play it again.

	DALLAS (AP) -- Jason Kreis scored two goals today, including the  
game-winner with 35 seconds to play, to give the Dallas Burn a 2-1 
MLS victory over the winless Tampa Bay Mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mutiny (0-4) tied the game in the 87th minute on a header by  
Musa Shannon, and a shootout appeared inevitable. 
</P>

	But the Burn (3-2) got a corner kick in the final minute, and  
Ted Eck flicked the kick from Brian Haynes toward Kreis, who 
converted an open shot from seven yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Kreis scored in the 39th minute, sending a free kick inside the  
far post from more than 20 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay had 59 percent of the possession, but managed only  
four shots on goal to Dallas' six. Dallas also had a 7-4 advantage 
in corner kicks.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Stagger Toward NBA Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- More than ever, Shaquille O'Neal looked  
like one man against the world. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Los Angeles Lakers' 109-93 loss to the Utah Jazz on  
Saturday night, O'Neal was brilliant. He had 29 points, 14 rebounds 
and five blocks, humiliating every one of the four defenders the 
Jazz put on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's only remedy was to double- and sometimes triple-team him.  
When the Jazz collapsed on him, O'Neal usually found the open man -- 
and then tried to rebound his teammates' missed shots. And there 
were plenty of those. 
</P>
<P>
	His frustration on the court was obvious. Afterward, he slumped  
at his locker, his loud Hawaiian-print shirt the only animated 
thing about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is gut-check time for this team,'' O'Neal said. ``I thought  
we played hard. I'm really proud of my guys today. ... They showed 
a lot of effort and a lot of heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With consecutive losses to Seattle, Portland and Utah in the  
last six days, the Lakers appear in disarray with just nine games 
left before the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The three defeats all came against playoff contenders, and the  
Lakers must play three games in three nights starting Monday at 
home against Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all that controversy going on down there, it's got to be  
tough to play,'' Utah's Bryon Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Lakers remain convinced they can turn their season  
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our last couple of practices have been pretty good,'' said  
Kobe Bryant, who was 6-of-16 from the field and made four 
turnovers. ``Everybody's working hard, everybody's paying 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to turn around overnight,'' coach Kurt Rambis  
said. ``As a whole, we're showing progress. We're working on 
everything, and we're going to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers set a new course on Thursday when they declared their  
midseason experiment a failure and waived seven-time rebounding 
champion Dennis Rodman. But on Saturday it was clear why they 
rolled the dice on the Tattooed One in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Malone had his way with J.R. Reid, Robert Horry and Travis  
Knight, scoring 27 points and going to the line 14 times. Los 
Angeles needs the defense and rebounding at power forward that 
Rodman was supposed to provide, but never did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have an opinion,'' O'Neal said of Rodman's departure.  
He also declined to speak on the subject Friday, a day after Rodman 
was waived. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's behind us,'' Derek Fisher said. ``All we were focusing  
on was today's basketball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers got Glen Rice and Knight back in the lineup Saturday,  
but neither contributed much. Knight was scoreless in 17 minutes, 
though he played better defense than Reid, who scored one point in 
27 minutes of his first Lakers' start. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, who missed two games with tonsillitis, still isn't in the  
flow. He was 4-of-10 and disappeared in the third quarter, when the 
Jazz pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the schedule is not easy. The Lakers play Portland  
three times and travel to Houston and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers are practically locked into fourth or fifth place in  
the Western Conference. That probably means a first-round matchup 
with the Rockets, with the winner facing the Jazz or the Trail 
Blazers in the conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always keeping my spirits up, no matter what happens,''  
O'Neal said. ``Good times are ahead, hopefully. I always keep my 
spirit up. Nothing can break it.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Appeal for Farmers' Patience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Two federal officials asked an  
emotional group of farmers today for patience as the government 
scrutinizes increasing market concentration in the agriculture 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be straight with you and I want to listen,'' said  
Joel Klein, an assistant attorney general who directs the U.S 
Justice Department's antitrust division. ``I know you want action 
... but I've got to know the facts. And when we have the facts, we 
are not afraid to act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klein and Mike Dunn, who oversees the U.S. Agriculture  
Department's Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards 
Administration, flew in from Washington to hear from farmers who 
are concerned about low commodity prices and a lack of control in 
swiftly consolidating agricultural industries such as meatpacking, 
grain-processing and farm supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Unease about concentration has intensified since Cargill Inc. of  
Minneapolis, the nation's largest grain company, announced plans to 
buy the worldwide operations of second-ranked Continental Grain Co. 
The Justice Department is reviewing the proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the Cargill-Continental deal, DeKalb Genetics Corp.  
and agribusiness leader Monsanto Co. have merged in a $2.3 billion 
deal, Monsanto has acquired Scott, Miss.-based Delta &AMP; Pine Land 
Co., a leading producer of cotton seed, for $1.9 billion, and 
chemical giant DuPont Co. has announced plans to acquire Pioneer 
Hi-Bred International Inc., the world's largest seed corn company 
for $7.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come to Minnesota to make any friends or to  
compliment you on the job you're doing in Washington,'' Linus 
Solberg, a pork producer from Cylinder, Iowa, said at the rally in 
a hotel next to the South St. Paul stockyards. ``While the Justice 
Department is busy suing computer software companies for antitrust 
and the USDA is busy promoting free trade agreements, American 
farmers are being crushed by market-manipulating corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think about that tomorrow morning when you sit down for  
breakfast. Try eating your computer software or your global trade 
agreements,'' Solberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of farmers from as far away as Texas, Colorado and Ohio  
joined producers from the Dakotas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, 
Nebraska, Wisconsin and Minnesota at the event billed as the 
``Midwest Farm Price Crisis Forum'' rally. The rally was organized 
by Democratic Sens. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Tom Harkin of 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin said Klein's presence was a welcome sight.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time ... that we've ever gotten the head of  
the antitrust division of the Department of Justice to come out and 
listen to farmers,'' Harkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Waving placards reading ``It's Time to Act!'' and ``Protect  
Independent Farmers,'' farmers jumped out of their chairs cheering 
as speaker after speaker demanded that large corporations not be 
allowed to monopolize the food-processing industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's killing us. If something doesn't happen, we're going to  
be out of here,'' said Rhonda Perry, a Missouri farmer. ``This 
concentration ... is about corporate greed and control of the 
market. And it's time we stopped it.''

<HEADLINE>  Ground Forces in Balkans Expanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As hundreds more aircraft join NATO's air  
campaign, a less-noticed array of allied ground forces is 
assembling on the southern rim of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were brought to the region for humanitarian work and others  
for potential deployment as peacekeepers. But they could serve as 
the nucleus of an invasion force if the leaders of NATO reverse 
themselves and decide that only an invasion will achieve their aims 
against Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	The possible deployment of combat troops was discussed on both  
sides of the Atlantic Sunday. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
said anew that the Clinton administration is confident air power 
will achieve NATO's purposes and NATO Secretary General Javier 
Solana said the allies have no plans to authorize an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	But, in a significant addition to the ongoing ground troop  
dialogue, he added that ``if the moment comes when it is 
necessary'' to invade Yugoslavia, ``I'm sure the countries that 
belong to NATO will be ready to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, stressed it would take  
two to three months to prepare an invasion, if one were ordered. 
Military experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied ground forces arriving in the Balkans include some of the  
keys to ground combat, including U.S. Army Bradley infantry 
carriers and Apache attack helicopters, and British battle tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	About 12,000 NATO troops are in Macedonia, including some 600  
Americans. In neighboring Albania about 2,000 of a planned force of 
8,000 allied troops are preparing for a humanitarian relief effort. 
There also are several thousand U.S. troops in Bosnia as part of a 
NATO-led peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albania group includes the vanguard of a U.S. Army  
contingent, eventually to total 3,000 or more soldiers, that will 
operate two battalions of Apache attack helicopters and land-based 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Apache force is expected to begin operating soon against  
Serb armored forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``To a degree, it's academic,'' whether President Clinton will  
change his mind about ground troops, said retired Marine Corps 
Brig. Gen. Bernard Trainor. ``If you're going to put a force in 
there, it's going to take some time to get yourself organized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time ground forces can be assembled in large enough  
numbers to take on an invasion, the Serbs are likely to have 
completed their campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' -- the very acts of 
violence NATO is striving to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO assessment last summer concluded that it would take about  
200,000 allied group troops to conquer Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies hope relentless bombing ultimately will force  
Milosevic to accept a Kosovo peace deal that includes stationing 
international peacekeepers in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, allied ground troops were sent to Macedonia even  
before the bombing started March 24. Once ethnic Albanian refugees 
began streaming out of Kosovo by the tens of thousands, the NATO 
troops took up humanitarian chores. Allied troops in Albania and 
Macedonia are erecting tent camps for refugees and providing food 
and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Apache force is expected to begin operating soon against  
Serb armored forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In her comments Sunday, Albright was undeviating in opposition  
to introducing ground troops, a step that would make American 
casualties far more likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has said he has no intention (of ordering ground  
troops) and that the air campaign is inflicting a great deal of 
damage,'' Albright said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor Gerhard  
Schroeder of Germany endorsed the U.S. position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the important thing is to see the strategy we have  
through,'' Blair said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' He stressed 
``the dangers of a land force invasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder, interviewed on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' said he sees  
``no reason whatsoever'' to consider ground troops. ``Airstrikes 
have to be continued, and they have to be sharpened as well,'' 
Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's Solana denied a British newspaper report that the  
alliance is preparing for a late-May invasion of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, the alliance has no plans to go into an  
invasion,'' Solana said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``We are going to 
maintain the air campaign to the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics such as presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,  
say it is a mistake to give Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
the assurance he will not face NATO on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The ground war debate aside, U.S. officials say Yugoslav troops  
already are digging in and mining key land routes into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they expect a NATO invasion,'' Pentagon spokesman  
Kenneth Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic's foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, asked on NBC's  
``Meet the Press'' whether Serb forces were prepared for a ground 
war, said: ``Be sure that we can resist any kind of attacks, any 
kind of aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jovanovic said the United States and NATO should ``draw  
lessons'' from 26 days' of ``unsuccessful air raids and 
aggression'' in his country. 
</P>
<P>
	With a peace settlement seemingly dead for now, three  
possibilities emerge for the eventual use of NATO ground troops in 
Kosovo: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Invading and expelling Serb troops from the province.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Escorting ethnic Albanians back to their villages and  
protecting them against Serb reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Opening a land corridor to permit relief organizations to help  
tens of thousands of Kosovars hiding in the hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said no consensus exists either in America or among  
NATO allies for a ground war, chiefly because it almost certainly 
would mean substantial allied casualties and could ignite a wider 
war in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also is concerned about further antagonizing  
Russia, a traditional Serb ally which opposes the NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The second option is feasible, administration officials say,  
only if Milosevic agrees to accept the entry of peacekeepers. That 
seems unlikely, given that Milosevic's rejection of an 
international force doomed the Kosovo peace talks in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials are studying a land corridor for humanitarian  
relief, but that step is unlikely, Bacon said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon emphasized the complications NATO would face in attempting  
a land invasion: mountainous terrain limits attack routes from 
Macedonia and Albania; few navigable roads; and Serb artillery and 
mined bridges. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacking from the north, through Hungary, would mean fighting  
the Serbs all the way to Kosovo in southern Serbia, Bacon said, 
suggesting that was an unlikely option. 
</P>
<P>
	Even getting troops to the area would be hard, Bacon said, given  
the lack of major ports and airfields.

	Allied ground forces arriving in the Balkans include some of the  
keys to ground combat, including U.S. Army Bradley infantry 
carriers and Apache attack helicopters, and British battle tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	About 12,000 NATO troops are in Macedonia, including some 600  
Americans. In neighboring Albania about 2,000 of a planned force of 
8,000 allied troops are preparing for a humanitarian relief effort. 
There also are several thousand U.S. troops in Bosnia as part of a 
NATO-led peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albania group includes the vanguard of a U.S. Army  
contingent, eventually to total 3,000 or more soldiers, that will 
operate two battalions of Apache attack helicopters and land-based 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Apache force is expected to begin operating soon against  
Serb armored forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``To a degree, it's academic,'' whether President Clinton will  
change his mind about ground troops, said retired Marine Corps 
Brig. Gen. Bernard Trainor. ``If you're going to put a force in 
there, it's going to take some time to get yourself organized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time ground forces can be assembled in large enough  
numbers to take on an invasion, the Serbs are likely to have 
completed their campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' -- the very acts of 
violence NATO is striving to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO assessment last summer concluded that it would take about  
200,000 allied group troops to conquer Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies hope relentless bombing ultimately will force  
Milosevic to accept a Kosovo peace deal that includes stationing 
international peacekeepers in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, allied ground troops were sent to Macedonia even  
before the bombing started March 24. Once ethnic Albanian refugees 
began streaming out of Kosovo by the tens of thousands, the NATO 
troops took up humanitarian chores. Allied troops in Albania and 
Macedonia are erecting tent camps for refugees and providing food 
and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Apache force is expected to begin operating soon against  
Serb armored forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In her comments Sunday, Albright was undeviating in opposition  
to introducing ground troops, a step that would make American 
casualties far more likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has said he has no intention (of ordering ground  
troops) and that the air campaign is inflicting a great deal of 
damage,'' Albright said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor Gerhard  
Schroeder of Germany endorsed the U.S. position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the important thing is to see the strategy we have  
through,'' Blair said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' He stressed 
``the dangers of a land force invasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder, interviewed on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' said he sees  
``no reason whatsoever'' to consider ground troops. ``Airstrikes 
have to be continued, and they have to be sharpened as well,'' 
Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's Solana denied a British newspaper report that the  
alliance is preparing for a late-May invasion of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, the alliance has no plans to go into an  
invasion,'' Solana said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``We are going to 
maintain the air campaign to the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics such as presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,  
say it is a mistake to give Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
the assurance he will not face NATO on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The ground war debate aside, U.S. officials say Yugoslav troops  
already are digging in and mining key land routes into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they expect a NATO invasion,'' Pentagon spokesman  
Kenneth Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic's foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, asked on NBC's  
``Meet the Press'' whether Serb forces were prepared for a ground 
war, said: ``Be sure that we can resist any kind of attacks, any 
kind of aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jovanovic said the United States and NATO should ``draw  
lessons'' from 26 days' of ``unsuccessful air raids and 
aggression'' in his country. 
</P>
<P>
	With a peace settlement seemingly dead for now, three  
possibilities emerge for the eventual use of NATO ground troops in 
Kosovo: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Invading and expelling Serb troops from the province.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Escorting ethnic Albanians back to their villages and  
protecting them against Serb reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Opening a land corridor to permit relief organizations to help  
tens of thousands of Kosovars hiding in the hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said no consensus exists either in America or among  
NATO allies for a ground war, chiefly because it almost certainly 
would mean substantial allied casualties and could ignite a wider 
war in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also is concerned about further antagonizing  
Russia, a traditional Serb ally which opposes the NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The second option is feasible, administration officials say,  
only if Milosevic agrees to accept the entry of peacekeepers. That 
seems unlikely, given that Milosevic's rejection of an 
international force doomed the Kosovo peace talks in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials are studying a land corridor for humanitarian  
relief, but that step is unlikely, Bacon said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon emphasized the complications NATO would face in attempting  
a land invasion: mountainous terrain limits attack routes from 
Macedonia and Albania; few navigable roads; and Serb artillery and 
mined bridges. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacking from the north, through Hungary, would mean fighting  
the Serbs all the way to Kosovo in southern Serbia, Bacon said, 
suggesting that was an unlikely option. 
</P>
<P>
	Even getting troops to the area would be hard, Bacon said, given  
the lack of major ports and airfields.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Racist Plot Defense Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Two men accused of committing a  
murderous crime spree as part of a plot to set up a whites-only 
nation face a tough road as their defense opens this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Both their mothers testified for the prosecution. One placed her  
son near the scene of three 1996 murders. The other told the mostly 
black jury her son took part in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``God won't let me live with it anymore,'' Gloria Kehoe told her  
son, Chevie Kehoe, in front of jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Kehoe, 26, of  
Colville, Wash., and Danny Lee, 26, of Yukon, Okla., who are 
accused of racketeering, conspiracy and murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes Tuesday, skipping Monday, a key anniversary in  
white supremacist circles: April 19 marks the start of the American 
Revolution at the Battle of Lexington in 1775, the fiery federal 
raid on the Branch Davidians at Waco, Texas, in 1993, and the 
bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Court officials say the day off is only to give defense lawyers  
time to study the vast amount of prosecution evidence: more than 
150 witnesses and hundreds of exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges the two young white men were out to  
overthrow the federal government and set up a new nation, based in 
the Pacific Northwest, that would bar people of African, Asian, 
Hispanic or Jewish descent. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe and Lee are accused of the January 1996 robbery and  
killings of gun dealer William Mueller, his wife, Nancy, and her 
8-year-old daughter, Sarah Powell, in the northwest Arkansas town 
of Tilly. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims' decomposed bodies were found in an Arkansas bayou.  
Plastic bags had been taped over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution says Kehoe and Lee believed Mueller might have  
been a government informant and his wife might have been part 
American Indian. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors also have been told that:  
</P>
<P>
	--Kehoe and Lee detonated a bomb outside City Hall in Spokane,  
Wash., and were disappointed that it didn't cause much damage or 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	--Lee talked about killing people ``down South'' with whom he had  
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kehoe said in a television interview that white people are  
morally superior. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kehoe feared he might have to kill his own wife because she  
might be part Indian. He also allegedly talked of killing his 
parents to get their gun collection and of killing his brother, 
Cheyne, who has testified against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Kehoe brothers were convicted in Ohio of crimes related  
to a shootout with police. The shootout was videotaped by a police 
car camera and broadcast nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In this trial, Cheyne, 22, of Colville, Wash., and their mother  
provided graphic descriptions of what they said Chevie told them 
about killing the Mueller family. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kehoe, of Yaak, Mont., cried and looked at her son as she  
testified. ``It's got to be told, Chevie,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's mother, Debra Graham, testified that around the time of  
the Muellers' killings, her son was home visiting her in Oklahoma. 
And she said he left the day before the date on which authorities 
believe the Muellers were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their testimony and the many exhibits, Lee's attorney,  
Cathleen Compton, argues that the government had little physical 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think, without any disrespect to the court or anyone else,  
if these boys were in charge of conspiring to overthrow the 
government, we're all safe,'' Compton said.

<HEADLINE> Starr Mulls Next Whitewater Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutor Kenneth Starr said Sunday the  
decision by a Little Rock, Ark., jury to acquit former Clinton 
business associate Susan McDougal may be linked to the ``horrible'' 
effects his investigations of President Clinton and the first lady 
have had on the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a Little Rock trial,'' Starr said on ABC's ``This  
Week.'' ``This is difficult for the state of Arkansas. A sitting 
governor has been convicted and resigned. The president's business 
partners, the first lady's clients have been convicted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said his office has asked the Arkansas court for  
permission to interview the jurors in the McDougal case, and would 
not make a decision on a retrial on two remaining counts until 
after that is done. 
</P>
<P>
	Some jurors said they thought Starr's prosecutors were arrogant,  
and they acquitted her on an obstruction of justice charge partly 
on that basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would take that with a grain of salt,'' Starr said, noting  
that the comments were made only by a few jurors. ``But I will say 
this,'' he said, ``this has been horrible for Arkansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's investigations into Clinton's Whitewater land dealings  
have led to former Gov. Jim Guy Tucker pleading guilty to fraud, 
convictions against McDougal and her late husband James McDougal 
and friend Webster Hubbell, and charges against other Arkansas 
bankers and businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan McDougal last week was acquitted of the obstruction of  
justice charge stemming from her refusal to talk to Starr about her 
dealings with Clinton. The jury deadlocked on two criminal contempt 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also repeated his statements he made at a Senate hearing  
last week that he believes the independent counsel law is flawed 
and should not be renewed when it expires June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that rather than have an independent counsel's office,  
the attorney general should appoint and be accountable for special 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is, there is no mechanism to judicially check the  
attorney general's exercise of her authority under this statute. It 
is a false hope,'' Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Newsweek poll of 751 adults found 35 percent said Starr did a  
good job in handling the Monica Lewinsky matter, and 54 percent 
said he did a bad job. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll released Sunday also found that 35 percent said the  
independent counsel law should be extended, while 58 percent 
supported its termination. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage  
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said U.S. District Court Judge Susan Webber Wright was  
``extremely well reasoned'' in her opinion holding Clinton in 
contempt of court for giving false statements about his affair with 
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	But he would not comment on whether the decision would lead to  
his indicting Clinton. ``There are very serious issues with respect 
to a sitting president,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Six Must Pay $1M To Sex Slaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Six men who admitted forcing 17  
women and girls into a prostitution-slavery ring were ordered to 
pay a total of $1 million to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The six men, who pleaded guilty to helping run brothels in  
Florida and South Carolina, were also sentenced Friday to between 
2 1/2 and 6 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The ringleader, Rogerio Cadena, 52, pleaded guilty to conspiring  
to violate the women's civil rights and was sentenced three weeks 
ago to 15 years in prison and also ordered to pay $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Cadena's organization smuggled the women, some  
as young as 14, to the United States from Mexico with promises of 
steady work, then forced them into prostitution from 1996 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims had sex with as many as 130 men a week, prosecutors  
said. The women were allowed to keep only $3 of the $20 to $25 
charged by Cadena's men, and the $3 went back to the organization 
for room and board. 
</P>
<P>
	The ring was discovered when two 15-year-old girls escaped and  
found their way to the Mexican consulate.

<HEADLINE> Krone Rides 3 Winners on Last Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND PRAIRIE, Tex. (AP) -- Julie Krone went out a big winner.  
</P>
<P>
	Krone, the winningest female jockey and the only one to ever  
take a Triple Crown race, said goodbye to the sport Sunday at Lone 
Star Park with three winners. That gave her 3,546 in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Her last ride was aboard Desert Demon in the Lone Star Derby,  
and she finished second. In the big race of the day, the Texas 
Mile, her horse, Allen's Oop was third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very choked up about how the fans acted and how I was  
treated at Lone Star,'' Krone said. ``This was a wonderful 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling a little nostalgic about it. I'm very relieved I  
had some winners today. The competitive side of me wanted to go out 
as a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Krone rode in 20,475 races. Her biggest victory  
came in the 1993 Belmont Stakes aboard Colonial Affair. She ranked 
16th on the career earnings list with more than $81 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone won the second race of the day aboard Dance to Fit in the  
``Julie Krone Classic,'' booted home Executive Girl in the third, 
and guided Paris Jet across the finish line first in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had it in my mind to retire for a while, and I wanted to go  
out on my own terms like Wayne Gretzky,'' she said. ``I finished 
second in the first race of my career and the last race. 
</P>
<P>
	``In between, I had a lot of winners. This was a good day.''  
</P>
<P>
	Krone of Benton Harbor, Mich., who resides in Colts Neck, N.J.  
said she retired because she had nothing left to prove and ``was 
tired of getting hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She's had numerous broken arms, hands, and ankles during  
on-track spills. Still, she put 17 percent of her mounts in the 
winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's not just a great woman jockey, she's a great jockey in  
general,'' said Hall of Fame rider Gary Stevens. ``She's always 
been an outstanding jockey, a very competitive rider. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going out maybe not right at the top of her game but at  
a very good time in her career,'' Stevens said. ``And she's doing 
it with dignity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone had 277 stakes victories during her career. She had her  
best year in 1991, when her mounts earned $9.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone signed autographs for fans and fellow jockeys before her  
final day of racing began. Lone Star Park loaded her down with 
numerous gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	She also was given a big cake by her fellow competitors and one  
of the jockeys pushed her face into the icing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even being put into the cake was special for me,'' Krone said.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked what she would do with her time, Krone said she would ride  
jumper horses and ``sleep-in for about two years.''

	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak inaugurated  
a new stage of Cairo's subway Sunday that will take trains under 
the Nile, Egyptian radio reported.

	SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- Zapatista rebels are  
calling for a meeting of supporters from throughout Mexico to 
discuss the results of a nationwide referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued late Saturday night, the Zapatista  
National Liberation Army said the meeting would be held May 7-10 in 
La Realidad, a remote village in southern Mexico that serves as the 
Zapatistas' unofficial capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel leader Subcomandante Marcos said the gathering would  
discuss the results of a Zapatista referendum held across Mexico on 
March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zapatistas claim that 95 percent of the 2.5 million people  
who participated expressed support for their position on Indian 
rights, though the wording of the referendum made ``no'' votes 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels are trying to build support for their version of a  
plan for greater Indian rights. The government claims it has 
reached an agreement with the rebels, but has worded its version in 
a way that gives somewhat less autonomy to Indian communities than 
does the Zapatista version.

normally busy beaches, making the water a health hazard. Work on

	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Colombian President  
Andres Pastrana met with Cuba's Fidel Castro on Sunday and 
discussed his demand that leftist guerrillas release 32 hostages 
seized in an April 12 plane hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana said he had ``shared information'' about the hijacking  
and other matters with Castro, but that there was no talk of Castro 
mediating an end to the standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The two spoke following a weekend summit of the Association of  
Caribbean States in Santo Domingo. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana has been trying to win Castro's help in negotiating  
with the communist rebels. He asked Castro to mediate talks during 
a visit to Havana in January, but Castro has been noncommittal. 
Cuba's communist government actively supported Marxist-inspired 
rebel movements throughout Latin America in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana, who said Friday that he won't negotiate the release of  
those it says were seized by the National Liberation Army, 
expressed frustration that the kidnappers had not issued demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't want to talk, if they don't want to negotiate,  
that's where the problem is,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's government has accused the guerrillas of hijacking  
the Avianca flight and hauling its passengers and crew deep into 
rebel-held territory. The captors have released nine passengers.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Foes Open Buffalo Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Activists on both sides of the abortion  
issue noisily clashed on the steps of a federal courthouse Sunday, 
the first day of a week-long campaign by abortion foes. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking over the shouts of abortion rights advocates, Operation  
Rescue National Director Flip Benham restated plans to use 
Operation Save America to spread their message at clinics, schools 
and bookstores in the Buffalo area throughout the week. Protesters 
will denounce abortion, child pornography and teen sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Local and national organizers have sent out 60,000 invitations  
and Operation Rescue has encouraged people to ``storm the gates of 
hell'' in Buffalo from April 18 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether followers would obey a court order to remain 15 feet to  
60 feet from specified doctors' offices, clinics and hospitals 
remained uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we need to honor God's law first. No man's law can be  
worthy unless it first honors God's law,'' said Eileen Schopf, 
spokeswoman for Operation Save America and Last Call Ministries. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters who invade the established buffer zones may face  
contempt and trespassing charges carrying penalties of up to two 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Although organizers have said Operation Save America would be  
more prayerful and peaceful than the similar Spring of Life 
protests here in 1992, there were isolated incidents of pushing and 
shoving as demonstrators jockeyed for space on the courthouse 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated 150 people out Sunday appeared evenly divided in  
numbers between anti-abortion, abortion rights supporters and 
reporters and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion rights activists have condemned the timing and choice  
of location for Operation Save America. The demonstrations were 
announced a week after last October's sniper killing of abortion 
provider Dr. Barnett Slepian inside his home in the Buffalo suburb 
of Amherst, with organizers calling Buffalo a ``battleground.'' 
</P>

	Ms. Schopf said the event was planned long in advance of the  
doctor's death, which remains unsolved, and was made public shortly 
after in response to media inquiries about the future of the 
anti-abortion movement.

<HEADLINE> Drastic Life Change for 1st Rounder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Life is changing dramatically for Edgerrin  
James. 
</P>
<P>
	No longer will he have to spend summers harvesting watermelons  
to raise money for his family. Never again will his family have to 
rely on food stamps to get by. 
</P>
<P>
	As the first-round draft pick of the Indianapolis Colts, and the  
fourth overall pick in the draft, he'll soon be a multimillionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very satisfying,'' James said Sunday, during his first  
visit to the Colts' headquarters. ``It's a big world out there and 
a lot of people don't know about it (being poor). Growing up, I was 
one of those (that knew).'' 
</P>
<P>
	James passed up his senior year of college eligibility at Miami  
because he needed money. Money to support his 22-month-old 
daughter. Money to help his mother, a cafeteria worker at Immokalee 
High School who raised six sons on her own, never earning more than 
$17,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming from a rural farming community, James has overcome a  
series of domestic problems to reach this point as a 20-year-old. 
An uncle killed himself in the family's backyard, a sister died in 
her crib, his father has been a non-factor in the family life for 
years and another uncle who became a father-figure was jailed for 
dealing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Food stamps met some of the family's needs and for three  
consecutive summers James traveled to Georgia farm fields to 
harvest watermelons, getting paid $20 per truckload. 
</P>
<P>
	James has learned to cherish money and is considering not having  
an agent represent him in talks with the Colts. He may hire an 
attorney on an hourly basis to prepare his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	James said he never thought about being picked ahead of Heisman  
Trophy winner Ricky Williams, who draft forecasters had said was 
the best running back available. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the Colts made the right decision,'' James said. ``I  
knew when I got to the NFL I'd make my mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James is expected to be taking handoffs from 1998 first-round  
draft pick Peyton Manning this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts called James on Saturday and a coach told him they  
were going to take him ahead of Williams, college football's career 
rushing leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, James wasn't certain. He said Sunday that he wasn't  
convinced until he heard his name announced on the ESPN telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection caused jubilation in the Florida Alligator Alley  
community where he watched the draft among a crowd of about 300. 
The group included his mother, grandmother, daughter, brothers, 
aunts and uncles, and even his long-estranged father. James asked 
to stay with them Saturday rather than make the trip here 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Lozano's Restaurant &AMP; Sports Bar -- a 30-year-old lime-and-pink  
building on a dusty, tractor-trailer filled road -- hosted the 
event, which also included some of James' college teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Lozano's usually sells Mexican food, but for this day Art Lozano  
prepared the barbecue the James' family prefers. Lozano, whose son, 
Art Jr., coached James in Pop Warner football, hauled in two 8-foot 
barbecue grills. 
</P>
<P>
	He cooked 60 pounds of ribs, 120 pounds of chicken, 100 pounds  
of pork steak and almost every side dish you could imagine, as a 
gift to James and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Local fruit and vegetable packing houses and farmers paid for  
about 40 percent of the $3,500 tab. Budweiser donated the beer, and 
a local florist provided arrangements in football-shaped baskets. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a day that I'll always remember. After I was picked,  
I was ready to show them all how I've overcome the adversity ... 
moving forward.'' he said. ``I'm ready to learn the system. I want 
to get in early and get the advantage of preparing to overcome 
rookie mistakes.''

<HEADLINE> Compaq Chairman, CFO Both Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Without notice and with little explanation,  
Compaq Computer Corp. president and CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer resigned 
today along with the company's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's board formed an interim chief executive's office  
to handle day-to-day operations of the world's largest supplier of 
computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Also resigning Sunday was Earl Mason, Compaq's chief financial  
officer. Compaq treasurer Ben Wells will take on Mason's duties at 
least on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been under tremendous pressure from stockholders  
since it stunned Wall Street on April 9 by announcing its 
first-quarter earnings would be half of what analysts expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq shares, which traded as high as $51.25 earlier this year,  
dropped 23 percent on April 12, the first day of trading after the 
announcement. Compaq closed Friday at $23.62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compaq has the best team anywhere in the industry -- we have  
the people necessary to make the right changes that will reinforce 
our industry leadership,'' chairman Benjamin M. Rosen said. ``We 
have re-energized this company before, and working together, we 
will do it again.''

<HEADLINE> Exercise Machines May Lie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Do exercise machines lie?  
</P>
<P>
	The machines give you readouts of how many calories you burned,  
but experts say the readouts sometimes shade the truth. The 
machines can't account for factors ranging from the skill of the 
exerciser to the quality of the equipment's maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way these things can be 100 percent accurate,''  
said Mike May, a spokesman for the Sporting Goods Manufacturers 
Association, a trade group. ``In some cases, it's an 
understatement; in others, it's an overstatement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The machines can get close, however, and this should be enough  
to get the workout job done, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The machines base their calculations on standard formulas that  
predict how many calories a person should burn doing the exercise, 
said Richard Cotton, chief exercise physiologist for the American 
Council on Exercise, a fitness professionals' group based in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The formulas ``are average for the whole population,'' Cotton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble is that people can differ from the average. One  
variable is the efficiency of the exerciser's body in doing the 
workout. On a treadmill, for instance, some people lumber along 
while others are so graceful they seem to float. 
</P>
<P>
	The floaters are more efficient and therefore use less energy at  
the same speed or intensity. Similarly, a novice, who would move 
less efficiently, also would burn more calories. 
</P>
<P>
	An exercise that keeps more body parts moving, such as running,  
would have more room for variation than would an exercise that 
allows less motion, such as biking, said Harv Ebel, a project 
leader at Consumer Reports magazine. As a result, a treadmill 
workout could allow more variation than a ride on a stationary 
bike. 
</P>
<P>
	To make a reading better fit an individual exerciser, a  
higher-end machine lets the user key in important personal data 
such as weight. ``If (the machine) never asks you to punch in your 
body weight, it is impossible for that machine to be accurate,'' 
Ebel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The more weight that has to be lifted during the exercise, the  
more calories are burned. As a result, weight is a bigger variable 
for a walker or runner than it is for a biker, whose lower body is 
supported by the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	ICON Health and Fitness of Logan, Utah, a leading treadmill  
manufacturer, gears the caloric expenditure of its lower-end 
machines for a person in the 150-185-pound range, spokeswoman Renee 
Awana said. An individual who wants a more accurate reading would 
have to do some math, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The user can divide his or her weight by 185, take that number  
and multiply it by the number of calories displayed,'' Awana said. 
For example, if you weigh 235 pounds, you would divide 235 by 185, 
getting 1.27, and multiply this by the readout of the calories 
burned. If the treadmill says you burned 100 calories, the more 
accurate total would be 127 calories, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher-end machines need only to be given the weight, and they  
do the math, Awana said. 
</P>
<P>
	But even equipment that does the math tends to have problems in  
keeping the numbers straight, Ebel said. In one test on various 
brands, the machines indicated the runner was going a bit faster 
than Consumer Reports lab tests found the belt actually was moving, 
he said. This would give an exerciser a somewhat overblown sense of 
accomplishment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intuitively, it would make sense,'' Ebel said. ``If they said  
it was a bit higher than it is, it makes you feel good about using 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And maintenance slippage can allow such things as belt slippage,  
which can throw the readings off, Cotton said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, if a person uses the same equipment all the time, the  
lack of a perfect calorie count may not matter, Cotton said. The 
machines tend to be consistent in their errors, so any improvement 
in exercise will show up as a better reading on the machine, even 
if it's not quite the right reading, he said.

<HEADLINE> Daughter Seeks To Honor Jim Thorpe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Okla. (AP) -- Jim Thorpe's 77-year-old daughter is  
orchestrating a drive to get her father declared the 20th century's 
top athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	Grace Thorpe hopes to collect enough signatures on a petition to  
convince sportswriters and broadcasters that her father was the 
best athlete of the 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe was the 1912 Olympic track champion and also played pro  
football and baseball. Thorpe is the only person to have won gold 
medals in both the Olympic pentathlon and decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dad was not only good at one sport. He was good at three,''  
Ms. Thorpe said. ``There's no competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Athlete of the Century'' petition drive she instigated  
about four years ago so far has yielded about 4,000 signatures.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Stagger Toward NBA Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- More than ever, Shaquille O'Neal looked  
like one man against the world. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Los Angeles Lakers' 109-93 loss to the Utah Jazz on  
Saturday night, O'Neal was brilliant. He had 29 points, 14 rebounds 
and five blocks, humiliating every one of the four defenders the 
Jazz put on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's only remedy was to double- and sometimes triple-team him.  
When the Jazz collapsed on him, O'Neal usually found the open man -- 
and then tried to rebound his teammates' missed shots. And there 
were plenty of those. 
</P>
<P>
	His frustration on the court was obvious. Afterward, he slumped  
at his locker, his loud Hawaiian-print shirt the only animated 
thing about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is gut-check time for this team,'' O'Neal said. ``I thought  
we played hard. I'm really proud of my guys today. ... They showed 
a lot of effort and a lot of heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With consecutive losses to Seattle, Portland and Utah in the  
last six days, the Lakers appear in disarray with just nine games 
left before the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The three defeats all came against playoff contenders, and the  
Lakers must play three games in three nights starting Monday at 
home against Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all that controversy going on down there, it's got to be  
tough to play,'' Utah's Bryon Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Lakers remain convinced they can turn their season  
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our last couple of practices have been pretty good,'' said  
Kobe Bryant, who was 6-of-16 from the field and made four 
turnovers. ``Everybody's working hard, everybody's paying 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to turn around overnight,'' coach Kurt Rambis  
said. ``As a whole, we're showing progress. We're working on 
everything, and we're going to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers set a new course on Thursday when they declared their  
midseason experiment a failure and waived seven-time rebounding 
champion Dennis Rodman. But on Saturday it was clear why they 
rolled the dice on the Tattooed One in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Malone had his way with J.R. Reid, Robert Horry and Travis  
Knight, scoring 27 points and going to the line 14 times. Los 
Angeles needs the defense and rebounding at power forward that 
Rodman was supposed to provide, but never did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have an opinion,'' O'Neal said of Rodman's departure.  
He also declined to speak on the subject Friday, a day after Rodman 
was waived. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's behind us,'' Derek Fisher said. ``All we were focusing  
on was today's basketball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers got Glen Rice and Knight back in the lineup Saturday,  
but neither contributed much. Knight was scoreless in 17 minutes, 
though he played better defense than Reid, who scored one point in 
27 minutes of his first Lakers' start. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, who missed two games with tonsillitis, still isn't in the  
flow. He was 4-of-10 and disappeared in the third quarter, when the 
Jazz pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the schedule is not easy. The Lakers play Portland  
three times and travel to Houston and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers are practically locked into fourth or fifth place in  
the Western Conference. That probably means a first-round matchup 
with the Rockets, with the winner facing the Jazz or the Trail 
Blazers in the conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always keeping my spirits up, no matter what happens,''  
O'Neal said. ``Good times are ahead, hopefully. I always keep my 
spirit up. Nothing can break it.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Disabled Care Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORROW, Ga. (AP) -- Three years ago, Elaine Wilson sat in a state  
mental hospital wearing little more than a sheet, her eyes glazed 
and tongue lolling from medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``I barely remember that much. In the hospital, I felt like I  
was in a box that I would never get out of,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Ms. Wilson lives in a personal care home, where she cooks  
her own meals. She is learning math at a community-based day 
program that teaches life skills. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old, who has a personality disorder and suffered  
brain damage during a bout with meningitis, credits her turnaround 
to her new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	She is one of two plaintiffs in a Supreme Court case that could  
decide whether the Americans with Disabilities Act should force 
states to place mentally disabled patients into community settings, 
not hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	L.C. vs. Olmstead, which Ms. Wilson joined in 1996, will be  
argued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's handling of Ms. Wilson's care, while not malicious,  
``was a pretty studied lack of effort that in our view was 
definitely inexcusable,'' said Sue Jamieson of Atlanta Legal Aid, 
who filed the suit for Lois Curtis and then added Ms. Wilson. 
``These two women were just stuck in a place where they didn't 
belong for as long as three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jamieson filed the suit in May 1995 against Tommy Olmstead, the  
Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Human Resources, which 
runs the state mental hospital system. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though doctors said Ms. Curtis, who is schizophrenic and  
mentally retarded, was a candidate for community-based care, the 
state would release her only to her mother, who was unequipped to 
care for her. That prolonged her hospital stay, although she is now 
in a personal care home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wilson had a similar recommendation from her doctors but was  
hospitalized for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	She gained her release only after the suit was upheld in both  
federal district and appeals courts. Georgia is asking the Supreme 
Court to overturn the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, 
which required the state to provide community-based care for Ms. 
Wilson and Ms. Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit argues that by refusing to place the two women in  
community care, the state violated the disabilities act, which 
requires programs to place the disabled in the ``most integrated 
setting possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state counters that the services weren't provided to Ms.  
Curtis and Ms. Wilson because no space was available in existing 
programs and creating new ones would be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The state mental health budget is $696.8 million, a figure that  
would dramatically increase if a massive switch to community 
services is mandated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state cannot comply with its duty to provide adequate  
facility (institution) programs if it moves any more of its 
facility funds to community programs,'' Assistant Georgia Attorney 
General Patricia Downing argued in her brief. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said such a far-reaching decision would be a violation  
of states' rights. Twenty-two states initially endorsed Georgia's 
position and another four joined later, but 19 of the 26 have since 
pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Many mental-health advocates say the states want to keep  
hospitals running at capacity to save themselves the political 
headaches that come with cutting state jobs and facing angry 
health-care worker unions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear this ruling could mean a lot of jobs are  
downsized, and people are fighting it,'' said Ira Burnim, legal 
director for the Washington-based Bazelon Center for Mental Health 
Law. 
</P>
<P>
	But other advocates say changing too fast can create problems at  
both the state and private level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people could end up at programs that are not equipped to  
handle their expensive medical and psychological needs,'' said 
Tamie Hopp, executive director of Voice of the Retarded, which 
endorses the 11th Circuit ruling but wants hospitals to be kept 
open. ``When you start shutting down hospitals, people are without 
that choice as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wilson doesn't care what the Supreme Court rules, as long as  
she never has to go back to the Georgia Regional Hospital at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you did there was eat, get a shower or maybe smoke a  
cigarette,'' she said. ``No privacy neither. I feel like a real 
person again, and no one is going to take that away from me.''

<HEADLINE> Ancient Technology Battles Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASCABEL, Ariz. (AP) -- As monuments go, Barbara Clark's desert  
dams are so innocuous that even she has trouble finding them. Even 
with a map. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where the heck are you?'' she hollers into the mesquite as her  
pickup truck barrels and bucks up the parched stream bed of the 
ephemeral Rio San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
	Steering with her knees, Clark ignores the brambles lashing the  
windshield and deftly rolls a cigarette from a gallon plastic bag 
of tobacco jiggling on her lap. 
</P>
<P>
	She's far from lost. There's only one way in and out of this  
remote, wild crease in the Santa Catalina Mountains, located two 
hours east of Tucson's lush green golf courses and sprawling 
suburbs. Fifty miles from the border, its a place where American 
Top 40 and Mexican salsa radio collides and dissolves in a cloud of 
static. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just lee-tle, lee-tle piles of rocks,'' Clark  
explains, craning her neck through the cloud of blue smoke. ``We do 
the best with what we've got out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And rocks are about all that's left. With them, Clark aims to  
slow precious floodwater and break the grip of a harsh drought 
before it wrings the last gasp from a slice of the Sonora Desert 
that has been grazed, smelted, eroded, irrigated and developed 
since the Spanish conquistador Coronado launched his quest for 
Eldorado up this same dry wash in 1539. 
</P>
<P>
	Many water utilities and corporate farmers from California to  
Florida have responded to the crisis by pumping more of their 
stored water from reservoirs and aquifers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clark, a 50-year old potter and self-described hippie  
homesteader, is trying to meld the simple technologies of ancient 
Indian watercourses with '60s-style community activism. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past three years, she has organized valley neighbors,  
volunteers and hired hands to assemble 5,200 tiny loose-rock dams 
at key junctures around a 10,000-acre parcel in the San Pedro 
watershed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dams' function is not to impound water, but slow its  
downhill dash and encourage more of it to seep into the earth. 
</P>
<P>
	And just in time. Conditions are the driest in the 30 years  
Clark has been living along the San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
	A close inspection reveals the dams are assembled according to a  
design developed by the Hohokam, pueblo Indians who first farmed 
this wash 1,000 years ago. Two dozen stones nestle in the shape of 
an arrowhead across a narrow gulch. 
</P>
<P>
	While the design is native in origin, Clark uses the same  
vocabulary as the engineers who dammed the West's great rivers with 
concrete and steel barriers as tall as skyscrapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Straddling the ditch, Clark tosses back her long, gray braid and  
undertakes a few simple repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the center of the channel she places the keystone, a rock the  
size of a basketball. Then she surrounds it with riprap, or smaller 
rubble. The structure forms a small V. 
</P>
<P>
	Runoff is channeled over the center of the dam, or the spillway.  
It flows gently downhill across the dam's apron. 
</P>
<P>
	With her skilled potters' hands, Clark snuggles the rocks close  
to avoid creating sharp angles that will only agitate the water or, 
worse, create a waterfall, and encourage more erosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Do her dams work? Clark answers with a shrug.  
</P>
<P>
	``This valley is so beautiful and its about the only one left  
that isn't trashed,'' Clark said. ``You can build all the dams in 
the world, but if you don't incorporate them into the landscape, 
it'll just lead to more erosion. Over the next 10 years, we'll see 
if these little guys do any good.''

<HEADLINE> Antigua Replaces Bank Overseers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) -- Antigua has replaced the overseers of  
its offshore banks, acting after the United States charged it was 
undermining money-laundering efforts and urged U.S. banks to 
closely scrutinize transactions from the Caribbean island. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister John St. Luce told reporters the former British  
colony also shortly will amend money-laundering legislation ``to 
make Antigua one of the safest and most desirable locations for 
international banking in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Friday, St. Luce insisted that the  
government is ``very keen to continue our efforts with the 
international community to block every loophole for financial 
crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said none of the new overseers are tied to offshore banks -- a  
reference to the U.S. complaint that four of six of the previous 
board members represented the institutions they were supposed to 
regulate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new board includes former banker and current Health Minister  
Bernard Percival, as chairman, prominent businessman and former 
banker Jose Benjamin, Deputy Financial Secretary Eustace Peters, 
former Police Commissioner Edric Potter, Antigua's ambassador to 
the United States, Lionel Hurst, and Minister of State Assot 
Michael as deputy chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 7, the U.S. Treasury Department urged U.S. banks and  
savings institutions to more closely scrutinize all financial 
transactions in and out of Antigua and Barbuda, saying recent 
government actions there ``will undermine U.S. efforts to crack 
down on international money laundering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second time in three years that the department  
has targeted a specific country in an advisory. The first, in March 
1996, was aimed at the Seychelles. 
</P>
<P>
	Antigua and Barbuda, population 64,000, has 50 banks primarily  
serving offshore clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. treasury said the government had significantly weakened  
its anti-money laundering law in November, by strengthening bank 
secrecy rules and inhibiting investigations.

<HEADLINE> TV-Bicycle Link-Up Battles Fat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents may have a way to budge their  
chip-chomping, TV-watching kids from the family sofa: a bicycle 
hooked up electrically to the set. To see their favorite shows, 
couch potatoes have to pedal. 
</P>
<P>
	An obesity researcher who came up with the ``TVcycle'' says  
early tryouts helped youngsters shed fat and discouraged TV 
viewing. 
</P>
<P>
	David Allison of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York knows  
parents are not going to race to rewire TV sets and he cautions 
that his findings are preliminary. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says his small study of a few overweight New York  
children is important because it suggests tinkering with the 
technology that makes life more comfortable -- but also more 
sedentary and fattening -- could help trim Americans' expanding 
waistlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not naive enough to think we're going to solve the  
world's obesity problems with TVs hooked to bicycles,'' Allison 
said. ``But there are other things we could do ... that are limited 
only by our imaginations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institutes of Health says about 55 percent of  
American adults are overweight or obese, up from 43 percent in 
1960. Studies also suggest more than 13 percent of youngsters ages 
6 through 17 are overweight, and getting fatter each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of exercise is a main cause.  
</P>
<P>
	Research shows television is a major culprit for kids,  
mesmerizing children who otherwise might burn calories while 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Formal exercise programs do not help much because it is hard to  
get to a gym or playground regularly, particularly for young 
children with busy parents, so scientists are hunting for 
home-based tricks to get kids moving, Allison said. 
</P>
<P>
	For his experiment, an engineer rewired TV sets to work only  
while the viewer was pedaling an attached bicycle. Built-in 
computers measure how long the televisions were on. The TVcycles, 
which are back in Allison's office as he hunts money for a larger 
study, are not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	With NIH funding, Allison delivered the TVcycles to six  
overweight TV fans, ages 8 to 12, and put standard exercise bikes 
in front of televisions for four similar children. 
</P>
<P>
	The kids did not diet and the televisions for the TVcycle group  
were locked to prevent cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody nagged the youngsters to pedal or lose weight, Allison  
said. ``We just said, 'Here you go. For the TV to work, you have to 
pedal. See ya,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten weeks later, the four kids who watched television while  
lolling on the couch saw 20 hours a week and bicyled only 8 minutes 
a week, Allison said before presenting his results at a biology 
conference in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The six TVcycle kids watched an hour a week and pedaled an hour  
a week. But that was not all the TVcycle kids watched. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not pedal when the family watched television together  
and there was some cheating, when parents lets kids watch a special 
show on a set not part of the test, Allison said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pedaling kids finished the study with 2 percentage  
points less total body fat and 3 percentage points less fat on 
their legs than the other children. So those kids must have been 
more active during the time once spent watching TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite amazing they'd see any change'' in such a short  
time and in kids who did not diet, said Michael Jacobson of the 
Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy 
group that fights obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison says the study shows scientists should look for  
innovative ways to encourage physical activity and better 
nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his more radical suggestions is charging a quarter to  
ride an elevator, which might leading more people to use the 
stairs.

<HEADLINE> Boys Choir of Harlem Branches Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COMMERCE, Texas (AP) -- The Boys Choir of Harlem is branching out  
from New York to form satellite choirs in some of the biggest 
cities in the nation -- Miami, Chicago, San Francisco, Milwaukee and 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	And Commerce, Texas, population 7,192.  
</P>
<P>
	``I say, why not Commerce?'' said Anthony Harris, director of  
Project Keep Hope Alive, whose choir is working with the Boys Choir 
of Harlem. ``The needs of the kids are no different in Detroit or 
San Francisco or Miami.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Project Keep Hope Alive, which provides after-school activities  
for black boys, is based at the Texas A&AMP;M University-Commerce 
campus about 60 miles northeast of Dallas. Of its 67 members, about 
50 sing in the Voices of Hope choir. 
</P>
<P>
	``Music has a way of channeling creativity in a positive  
direction,'' Harris said. ``It's important to get kids thinking 
they can create something very positive and very beautiful. It also 
instills self-discipline in kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boys Choir of Harlem leaders will travel to Commerce this summer  
to help the Voices of Hope singers fine-tune their skills in 
gospel, jazz, rap and classical music.

<HEADLINE> Bosox Put Reliever Tom Gordon on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Relief ace Tom Gordon was put on the 15-day  
disabled list by the Boston Red Sox on Sunday because of a strained 
right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon missed the first two weeks of spring training with the  
same injury. He reaggravated it Saturday in the ninth inning after 
throwing five pitches against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox officials said Gordon was sent Sunday to the University  
of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester for an MRI. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston manager Jimy Williams would not discuss who will take  
Gordon's spot as his closer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Flash is still our closer,'' Williams said. ``We will not  
designate anyone for that role until we need to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston is expected to use Derek Lowe, Mark Guthrie, Kip Gross  
and Jim Corsi to finish games until Gordon returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have several pitchers out there that can close a  
game,'' Williams said. ``I don't think there is any one particular 
individual that I'm going to go to and say, `Hey, you are our 
closer.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon set a major league record for consecutive saves last  
season with 43 finishing with a league-leading 46, a team record. 
He has converted three of five save chances this year, striking out 
eight in 3 2-3 scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston recalled right-hander Brian Rose from Triple-A Pawtucket  
to take Gordon's spot on the roster.

<HEADLINE>  Chepchumba Sets World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Hear about the world marathon record that wasn't?  
</P>
<P>
	Kenyan friends Joyce Chepchumba and Tegla Loroupe won the London  
and Rotterdam Marathons on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	World record holder Loroupe cruised to a faster time than her  
countrywoman, yet Chepchumba collected $230,000 in prizes and 
bonuses for setting a world mark over the same distance of 26 
miles, 385 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Puzzled?  
</P>
<P>
	Let the organizers of the London Marathon explain.  
</P>
<P>
	Chepchumba's time of 2 hours, 23 minutes, 22 seconds actually  
was only the 12th fastest by a woman, and later in the day became 
the 13th after Loroupe ran 2:22.49 in Rotterdam. It also was more 
than 2 1/2 minutes slower than Loroupe's official world record of 
2:20.47 set at Rotterdam last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the leading marks all were set in mixed races, where the  
women have the advantage of running alongside the faster men. 
</P>
<P>
	The women in the London Marathon start a half hour early so they  
won't be affected by the men's race, which was won by Morocco's 
Abdelkader El Mouaziz. Organizers offered a bonus of $125,000 for 
anyone beating Lidia Simon's mark of 2:23.24, which was set by the 
Romanian in a women's-only race at Osaka, Japan, in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Chepchumba also collected $55,000 for winning Sunday's race,  
$25,000 more for a course record and a $25,000 time bonus for 
finishing inside 2:24.00. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I'll buy a new dress,'' Chepchumba said after learning  
of her $230,000 payday. 
</P>
<P>
	But she was adamant that her performance was better than the  
official world record Loroupe set last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the men run with the women, you get a better time,'' she  
said. ``But I think it's better for the women to run on their 
own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manuela Machado, a Portuguese world champion marathon runner who  
placed third behind Chepchumba and Adriana Fernandez of Mexico, 
agreed the Loroupe's performance in Rotterdam last year was not as 
good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that Joyce's time is more special,'' she said.  
``When Tegla ran in Rotterdam, she had two pacemakers. I value 
Joyce's time better than Tegla's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez placed second in 2:24.06 and Machado was third in  
2:25.09. 
</P>
<P>
	El Mouaziz scored a runaway victory in the men's race and would  
have set a course record if he hadn't slowed to wave to the fans in 
the final 200 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	He clocked 2:07.57 to leave behind the strongest ever field in  
the 19th London Marathon. Two-time titlist Antonio Pinto finished 
second, 1:03 behind, and defending champ Abel Anton of Spain was 
third in 2:09.41. 
</P>
<P>
	World record-holder Ronaldo Da Costa of Brazil was 17th, more  
than eight minutes slower than his mark of 2:06.05 set in Berlin 
last year. Olympic champion Josia Thugwane, who was among the 
leaders for half the race, dropped out at 22 miles when he 
developed a cough.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Federal Bank To Appeal Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California Federal Bank will appeal a $23.3  
million award to the savings and loan, calling the judgment 
``flawed.'' The bank originally had sought more than $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The $23.3 million award falls far short of CalFed's actual  
damages,'' spokesman Walter G. Montgomery said Sunday in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert H. Hodges Jr. of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims  
on Friday found the government breached its contract with CalFed. 
</P>
<P>
	The case stems from a 1996 Supreme Court decision that said the  
government broke its contract with thrift institutions when it 
changed the rules on how they must count their assets as part of an 
S&AMP;L bailout in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	CalFed said last week's decision is ``flawed'' and agrees  
``neither with applicable law nor with the extensive evidence and 
testimony presented at trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco-based Golden State Bancorp is the publicly traded  
parent company of CalFed.

<HEADLINE> FCC Helps Resolve Phone, TV Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- It's tempting to sum up Susan Ness as the June  
Cleaver type. But behind her nurturing way is an agile power broker 
whose political and business savvy makes her good at settling 
disputes involving the nation's television and telephone systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In her five years as a member of the Federal Communications  
Commission, Ness has emerged as a crucial bridge between the 
agency's liberal and conservative factions, and an effective 
dealmaker at an agency that oversees roughly one-seventh of the 
nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``She doesn't come across as an aggressive person, but she knows  
what she wants and goes after it,'' said a friend, Supreme Court 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. ``You talk to Susan and you sense that 
you are getting an honest count.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Ginsburg was picked by President Carter to serve on the  
federal court here, it was Ness who had the savvy to take her to a 
centrist Republican whose support helped overcome what Ginsburg 
herself called her ``flaming feminist'' image among some 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Ness' friendship with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton -- they  
met at a Renaissance weekend in 1983 -- paved the way for her 
nomination to the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	The most senior of the agency's five commissioners, Ness is  
there at a time when the FCC is treading difficult political and 
policymaking waters. Key Republican lawmakers are upset over the 
agency's implementation of a 1996 law deregulating the 
telecommunications industries. They want to strip away some of its 
power, particularly over mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping pace with rapidly changing technology and with companies  
that don't fit neatly into one framework is another challenge: Is 
AT&AMP;T a telephone company, a cable television service, an Internet 
provider or all three? The agency also is overseeing broadcasters' 
move into digital, an issue Ness will speak about as the industry 
gathers for its annual meeting in Las Vegas this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``She knows a lot about this profession, but she doesn't wear it  
on her sleeve. She's just very solid,'' said another friend, Ann 
Lewis, counselor to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ness takes as much pride in being a mother as a senior  
government official. Son, David, 10, is a computer whiz who freely 
offers technical advice. Elisabeth, 14, sings, dances and acts in 
school plays. Ness always carries in her leather calendar a note 
Elisabeth, then 9, wrote on the day of her mother's Senate 
confirmation hearing. ``Good Luck. You needn't be nervous. You are 
my Mom and shall always be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some telecommunications lobbyists call Ness the FCC's in-house  
Mom, too. But Ness, unassuming and unfailingly polite, uses those 
traits to her advantage, drawing people to her for advice, to build 
consensus or to break through impasses. 
</P>
<P>
	When broadcasters, TV set makers, computer and cable TV guys  
were at loggerheads over digital TV technical standards several 
years ago and refused to deal with then-FCC chairman Reed Hundt, 
they sought out Ness. She quietly took control, steering and 
pushing them to reach agreement, giving deadlines, building public 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that she was the linchpin,'' recalls Peter  
Fannon, now an executive with Panasonic. The agreement is now a 
blueprint for building new digital TV sets, just now cropping up in 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hundt wanted to bail out overeager, but underfunded bidders  
for mobile phone licenses, Ness forged a compromise giving the 
companies some relief but requiring them to still come up with 
money. She also brokered a compromise that gave schools cheap 
hookups to the Internet and was a prominent figure in negotiations 
-- ultimately clinched by the White House -- that led to broadcasters 
having to air three hours of educational children's' programs a 
week. Both were key White House issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, despite her connection to Mrs. Clinton, the White House  
passed her over for chairman in 1996. Ness didn't have a champion 
in Clinton's inner circle and various industry groups preferred 
others, say those involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Ness' term expires June 30 and it's unclear whether Clinton  
will reappoint her. Senate Commerce Committee John McCain, R-Ariz., 
must clear any nomination and McCain generally believes 
commissioners should serve only one term. Ness could continue to 
serve for at least another year without being reappointed. Were she 
to leave and a successor not immediately take her place, the FCC 
could end up with paralyzing 2-2 deadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ness won't discuss her prospects. ``All I will tell you is that  
I love what I do,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer with an MBA from Wharton, Ness has more business  
experience than any member now on the FCC. For years she was a 
banker lending money to TV, radio, cable and telephone companies. A 
self-described pragmatic policy-maker who shuns the term 
``regulator,'' she asks: ``You can have all kinds of requirements 
but who is going to pay for them? Consumers?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocate Gene Kimmelman gives Ness high marks for  
protecting telephone consumers, but complains she didn't do enough 
to protect TV watchers from rising cable rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Some broadcasters, telephone executives and lawmakers, on the  
other hand, think she's too regulatory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't always agree,'' said Jeffrey Smulyan, chairman of  
Emmis Communications Corp., a large broadcasting company. ``But I 
never doubted that she has great concern of the impact that we have 
on people's lives.''

<HEADLINE> Confusion in NATO Account of Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Confusion over a deadly attack on a  
Kosovo refugee convoy deepened Sunday after NATO said a tape of a 
pilot it presented after the attack may not be the pilot who 
attacked the convoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has said the pilot on the tape described a strike  
against military targets -- without hitting civilians. However, NATO 
Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani said the pilot may indeed have struck 
civilians, adding that NATO is awaiting the results of an inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Marani said he produced the tape as ``an example'' of how a  
pilot reacts during a ground attack over Kosovo and because ``that 
tape was clear, was available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Yugoslav authorities said NATO planes had killed  
more than 60 Kosovo Albanians in an attack on a refugee column. A 
road strewn with refugee bodies was shown on Serbian television and 
foreign journalists were escorted to the site to film the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO acknowledged Thursday that at least one of its planes had  
mistakenly hit at least one civilian vehicle with fatal results. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO deeply regrets the loss of life from this tragic  
accident,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said Thursday at the 
alliance's daily media briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	After Shea's introductory comments, Marani played a tape of what  
he said ``may be this incident.'' The F-16 pilot, who was not 
identified, described an attack on a three-vehicle convoy he 
believed to be military vehicles involved in burning villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, NATO has faced mounting criticism of its refusal to  
explain discrepancies between the mistaken strike it acknowledged 
and remains seen by journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO acknowledged hitting just one civilian vehicle, possibly a  
tractor on a road north of the Kosovo town Djakovica. The Serbs 
showed several vehicles hit on a road south of the town. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Navy Capt. Steve Pietropaoli said Saturday that  
the pilot heard on the tape ``is not thought to be responsible in 
any way for anything other than the attack that he described on a 
military vehicle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Pietropaoli said he did not mean there was not an  
accidental attack on civilians in the area. ``It appears to be that 
that may be the case,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's military command is refusing to offer any further details  
of the refugee attack pending results of an investigation.

<HEADLINE> 3 Players Ejected in Baseball Brawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Three players were ejected following a  
bench-clearing brawl in tonight's game between the Seattle Mariners 
and Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim's Todd Greene charged the mound after being hit in the  
fourth inning by Seattle rookie Brett Hinchliffe, who had just 
given up a homer to Troy Glaus that cut the Mariners' lead to 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene and Hinchcliffe exchanged punches and were both ejected  
along with Angels pitcher Tim Belcher following the five-minute 
skirmish. John Halama replaced Hinchliffe, who was making his first 
major league start. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions started the previous inning, when Ken Griffey Jr. was  
hit by Anaheim pitcher Steve Sparks three batters after Domingo 
Cedeno homered for the Mariners. Before trotting to first base, 
Griffey pointed with his bat toward the Angels dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night, Glaus was hit by a pitch from Jamie Moyer to  
load the bases, and Greene hit the next pitch for a grand slam to 
seal Anaheim's 9-5 victory.

<HEADLINE> Coburn Says Oscar Win Was a Thrill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Although James Coburn has played the tough guy  
for most of his career, it took his role as a boozing, abusive 
father in ``Affliction'' to finally get the attention of the 
Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it's the first time I deserved the Oscar,'' Coburn  
says in the April 24 edition of TV Guide. Winning the Academy Award 
for best supporting actor was ``a thrilling experience and it still 
hasn't set in,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	All the same, Coburn hasn't completely shaken his tough-as-nails  
persona. 
</P>
<P>
	He's currently filming a Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie called  
``Atticus,'' in which he plays a father searching for answers about 
his son's mysterious death. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn said he accepted the part on condition that ``they get  
rid of the weepy stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the audience wants to cry, let them cry,'' he said. ``Let's  
not cry for them.''

<HEADLINE> Miami-Area Fire Burns 70,000 Acres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A fire fed by rapidly shifting wind  
burned out of control in the Everglades on Sunday, consuming 70,000 
acres of dry marsh grass and creating clouds of smoke that darkened 
the Miami area. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began on the Everglades' western edge Saturday,  
possibly ignited by heat from a vehicle's catalytic converter. It 
quickly became the largest of more than 2,450 blazes that have 
burned 130,000 acres in the state this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters from Texas and Arizona were called in to help.  
</P>
<P>
	With rainfall 90 percent below normal during Florida's dry  
season, officials fear a repeat of last summer, when fires scorched 
500,000 acres and forced 100,000 people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Meager showers late Saturday were more of a hindrance than help,  
making grass just damp enough to prevent setting backfires. Dry 
conditions, with temperatures in the 80s, gusty wind and low 
humidity, are expected in Florida through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Everglades blaze has been dubbed the ``Deceiving Fire''  
because of its frequently shifting winds. At one point Saturday, 
flames jumped over a fire crew, setting the vehicle near them 
ablaze. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a fright for us and stark reminder of how dangerous  
this is,'' said Gene Madden, a state fire spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Sunday, the fire came within 100 yards of Interstate 75,  
closing the main coast-to-coast route across south Florida known as 
Alligator Alley. Flames moved close to power lines in the 
Everglades and lines carrying electricity out of the Turkey Point 
nuclear power plant south of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second day in a row, spectacular clouds of reddish-brown  
smoke drifted 45 miles south to downtown Miami, where drivers used 
headlights in the daytime as they moved through city streets. A 
layer of ash dusted cars in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were smaller wildfires elsewhere in Florida.  
</P>
<P>
	Fires in St. Lucie County, midway between Miami and Orlando,  
destroyed 43 homes and damaged 33 others, forcing residents to 
spend the weekend searching ashes and rubble for anything worth 
saving. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike and Kim Gusrang lived 13 years in their first home, a  
one-story ranch style house, destroyed by the fire. Their losses 
included dozens of pictures of sons, Aaron, 9, and Jason, 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was like our little dream house,'' said Mike Gusrang.  
</P>
<P>
	In the northern part of the state, 35 families were evacuated  
and one house was destroyed Saturday in a 200-acre fire near Panama 
City in the Panhandle. Officials said Sunday that fire is under 
control.

<HEADLINE> Boston Home for Patriots Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino says he's willing to  
back a stadium for the New England Patriots in Boston if the team's 
deal in Connecticut falls through. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Menino said there was no site in the city that was  
suitable for a Patriots stadium. But after a group of civic leaders 
went public Friday with a last-minute campaign to block the 
Patriots' move to Hartford, Conn., Menino said the stadium could be 
located on an old incinerator site south of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a new man,'' Menino told The Boston Globe. ``I'm an  
individual who doesn't close his mind to opportunities. If I have 
an opportunity to listen and to be convinced, I'm there to listen 
and be convinced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The civic leaders opposing the move to Hartford have the support  
of the NFL, which prefers that the team remain in the Boston area, 
the sixth largest television market in the country, rather than 
relocate to Hartford, where smaller audiences would mean less TV 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL recently approved new financing that could help defray  
the costs of constructing a new stadium for Kraft and other 
big-city team owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Even House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, who did not approve a  
deal last year to put the Patriots in a new stadium in Foxboro, was 
receptive to league officials when they paid him a visit Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it is far from certain that the Hartford deal will  
collapse and give Massachusetts another shot at retaining its 
football franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	After new stadium plans for South Boston and Foxboro were  
rejected, Kraft struck a $374 million accord with Gov. John Rowland 
of Connecticut that is considered the most lucrative deal ever for 
an NFL owner. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agreement has been plagued by ongoing problems with the  
Hartford site and questions about whether the stadium would be 
completed by 2002, when Kraft wants it to be ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of their preliminary agreement, Kraft can decide to  
abandon the Connecticut proposal by the end of April.

<HEADLINE> Daughter Seeks To Honor Jim Thorpe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Okla. (AP) -- Jim Thorpe's 77-year-old daughter is  
orchestrating a drive to get her father declared the 20th century's 
top athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	Grace Thorpe hopes to collect enough signatures on a petition to  
convince sportswriters and broadcasters that her father was the 
best athlete of the 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe was the 1912 Olympic track champion and also played pro  
football and baseball. Thorpe is the only person to have won gold 
medals in both the Olympic pentathlon and decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dad was not only good at one sport. He was good at three,''  
Ms. Thorpe said. ``There's no competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Athlete of the Century'' petition drive she instigated  
about four years ago so far has yielded about 4,000 signatures.

<HEADLINE> `Iowa 47' Families Mark Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- After Gene Blakey's son and 46 shipmates  
were killed by an explosion aboard the USS Iowa in 1989, he 
expected the Navy to level with him about what caused the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Blakey believed the Navy could have done something to prevent  
the blast inside the turret of one of the battleship's 16-inch 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	But as former sailors and families of the ``Iowa 47'' gather for  
an observance Monday at the Norfolk Naval Base on the 10th 
anniversary of the explosion, Blakey doubts the Navy will ever tell 
the whole truth. 
</P>
<P>
	He agrees with the author of a new book, who contends the blast  
was an ``accident looking for a place to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even at the beginning, Blakey suspected a cover-up when the Navy  
told him the explosion that killed his son Scot, a gunners mate 3rd 
class, was caused by another sailor committing suicide over a 
homosexual affair gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy later backtracked and now says it will never know for  
sure what caused the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a tragic accident that happened,'' said Cmdr. Mike  
Andrews, a spokesman at the Norfolk Naval Base, where the Iowa was 
stationed at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The World War II-era battleship was on exercises in the  
Caribbean when a fireball of igniting gunpowder surged through the 
seven levels inside the armored gun turret. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the bridge, you could hear people scrambling around, and  
voices,'' said Dan Meyer, who was on the ship and later resigned 
from the Navy. ``These guys did not die instantaneously. They died 
very horrible deaths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few months after the explosion, Navy officers told Blakey that  
a petty officer named Clayton Hartwig, despondent over the breakup 
of an affair with another man aboard the ship, deliberately ignited 
gunpowder. 
</P>
<P>
	Blakey, 63, said he was suspicious from the start because the  
Navy told him and his wife ``they cleaned the ship up. ... They 
painted and everything before they got back to base. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to myself, `Why would they do that? They would be  
destroying all the evidence of what actually caused the 
accident.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the Navy's story changed. Adm. Frank B. Kelso III, then  
the chief of naval operations, publicly apologized to the Hartwig 
family and said there was no proof that Hartwig deliberately set 
off the gunpowder. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation conducted for Congress' General Accounting  
Office did not pinpoint a probable cause of the explosion, but said 
one possibility was that bags of unstable gunpowder were rammed 
into the gun's breech too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	That also was the conclusion of Charles C. Thompson II, a former  
producer for ``60 Minutes'' who initially investigated the 
explosion for the CBS program. His book ``A Glimpse of Hell: The 
Explosion on the USS Iowa and Its Cover-up'' was published last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa ``was a 59,000-ton accident looking for a place to  
happen,'' Thompson said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit filed by Blakey and his family was dismissed by the  
Supreme Court, but the Navy still faces a $12 million defamation 
suit by Hartwig's family. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Navy said there was no proof Hartwig caused the  
explosion, his sister, Kathy Hartwig-Kubicina, said the family 
wants the Navy to say definitely that he wasn't guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	``They blamed an innocent victim and they never corrected that  
mistake,'' said Mrs. Hartwig-Kubicina, 46, of Cleveland. She is in 
Norfolk for the memorial.

<HEADLINE> Exercise Machines May Lie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Do exercise machines lie?  
</P>
<P>
	The machines give you readouts of how many calories you burned,  
but experts say the readouts sometimes shade the truth. The 
machines can't account for factors ranging from the skill of the 
exerciser to the quality of the equipment's maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way these things can be 100 percent accurate,''  
said Mike May, a spokesman for the Sporting Goods Manufacturers 
Association, a trade group. ``In some cases, it's an 
understatement; in others, it's an overstatement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The machines can get close, however, and this should be enough  
to get the workout job done, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The machines base their calculations on standard formulas that  
predict how many calories a person should burn doing the exercise, 
said Richard Cotton, chief exercise physiologist for the American 
Council on Exercise, a fitness professionals' group based in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The formulas ``are average for the whole population,'' Cotton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble is that people can differ from the average. One  
variable is the efficiency of the exerciser's body in doing the 
workout. On a treadmill, for instance, some people lumber along 
while others are so graceful they seem to float. 
</P>
<P>
	The floaters are more efficient and therefore use less energy at  
the same speed or intensity. Similarly, a novice, who would move 
less efficiently, also would burn more calories. 
</P>
<P>
	An exercise that keeps more body parts moving, such as running,  
would have more room for variation than would an exercise that 
allows less motion, such as biking, said Harv Ebel, a project 
leader at Consumer Reports magazine. As a result, a treadmill 
workout could allow more variation than a ride on a stationary 
bike. 
</P>
<P>
	To make a reading better fit an individual exerciser, a  
higher-end machine lets the user key in important personal data 
such as weight. ``If (the machine) never asks you to punch in your 
body weight, it is impossible for that machine to be accurate,'' 
Ebel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The more weight that has to be lifted during the exercise, the  
more calories are burned. As a result, weight is a bigger variable 
for a walker or runner than it is for a biker, whose lower body is 
supported by the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	ICON Health and Fitness of Logan, Utah, a leading treadmill  
manufacturer, gears the caloric expenditure of its lower-end 
machines for a person in the 150-185-pound range, spokeswoman Renee 
Awana said. An individual who wants a more accurate reading would 
have to do some math, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The user can divide his or her weight by 185, take that number  
and multiply it by the number of calories displayed,'' Awana said. 
For example, if you weigh 235 pounds, you would divide 235 by 185, 
getting 1.27, and multiply this by the readout of the calories 
burned. If the treadmill says you burned 100 calories, the more 
accurate total would be 127 calories, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher-end machines need only to be given the weight, and they  
do the math, Awana said. 
</P>
<P>
	But even equipment that does the math tends to have problems in  
keeping the numbers straight, Ebel said. In one test on various 
brands, the machines indicated the runner was going a bit faster 
than Consumer Reports lab tests found the belt actually was moving, 
he said. This would give an exerciser a somewhat overblown sense of 
accomplishment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intuitively, it would make sense,'' Ebel said. ``If they said  
it was a bit higher than it is, it makes you feel good about using 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And maintenance slippage can allow such things as belt slippage,  
which can throw the readings off, Cotton said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, if a person uses the same equipment all the time, the  
lack of a perfect calorie count may not matter, Cotton said. The 
machines tend to be consistent in their errors, so any improvement 
in exercise will show up as a better reading on the machine, even 
if it's not quite the right reading, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kosgei Wins Rotterdam Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- It was a Kenyan double as Japhet  
Kosgei won the men's field and Tegla Loroupe took the women's title 
at the Rotterdam marathon today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosgei attacked three times in the final stages, finally  
breaking free to win in 2 hours, 7 minutes and 11 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	He shook off last year's winner, Spaniard Fabian Roncero, who  
finished second, 13 seconds back. Spaniard Julio Rey was third in 
2:07:38. 
</P>
<P>
	Roncero was in front of a lead group of eight runners at the  
halfway mark, which also included Dutch rabbit Kamiel Maase. They 
were close to the world-record mark of 1:02.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Kosgei and Rey, the group included Japanese Muneyuki  
Ojima, South Korean Yi-Yong Kim, Morrocan Abdesalem Serrokh and 
Kenyan and Simon Biwott. 
</P>
<P>
	Maase surprisingly stayed with the group until the 23-mile mark  
when Serrokh, Ojima and Kim all dropped from the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	Roncero and Kosgei were alone when they passed the 25-mile mark  
in 2:00:50, then Kosgei launched two unsuccessful breaks before 
finally freeing himself inside the final miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Tegla Loroupe won the women's race in 2:22:50. Countrywoman  
Susan Chepkemei finished second with a time of 2:26:40 while 
Spain's Ana Isabel came in third.

<HEADLINE> Jagr Repeats As Scoring Champion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was appropriate that Jaromir Jagr scored the  
winning goal in Wayne Gretzky's final game. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it a symbolic passing of the torch from the greatest scorer  
in NHL history to the greatest scorer in the game today. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gretzky finished the season with only 62 points, the  
second-lowest total in his NHL career, Jagr won the scoring title 
for the second straight season and third time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr, whose overtime goal gave Pittsburgh a 2-1 victory over the  
New York Rangers on Sunday, finished with 127 points, 20 more than 
runner-up Teemu Selanne of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr led the league with 83 assists, while Selanne was the top  
goal-scorer with 47 -- the first time since 1969-70 that the NHL 
didn't have at least one 50-goal scorer, excluding the 
lockout-shortened 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Milan Hejduk had two assists Sunday to capture the  
rookie scoring title with 48 points. He scored 18 points in his 
final 15 games to edge New Jersey's Brendan Morrison by one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa goalie Ron Tugnutt led the league with a 1.79  
goals-against average, the lowest since Tony Esposito had a 1.77 
mark in 1971-72. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas goalies Ed Belfour and Roman Turek combined to allow the  
fewest goals for one team, claiming the Jennings Trophy for the 
first time in Stars' history. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's Dominik Hasek, the NHL's most valuable player the past  
two seasons, got his ninth shutout of the season Sunday with a 3-0 
win over Washington. But he was runner-up in that category to 
Boston's Byron Dafoe, who finished with 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim's Guy Hebert was the league's most tested goalie, facing  
2,114 shots in 69 games -- an average of almost 31 shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Roberts of Carolina, who came out of retirement last season  
after career-threatening neck injuries, led the NHL in hits with 
260 -- an average of 3.37 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas led the league in points for the second straight year  
with 114, while New Jersey finished first in the Eastern Conference 
with 105. 
</P>
<P>
	The division winners were New Jersey (Atlantic), Ottawa  
(Northeast), Carolina (Southeast), Detroit (Central), Colorado 
(Northwest) and Dallas (Pacific).

<HEADLINE> Berkeley People's Park Hits 30 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Standing on the bright green grass of  
People's Park, sun dappling his balding head, soft breezes tugging 
at his designer tie, Dan Siegel isn't exactly the picture of a 
revolutionary soul on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	But 30 years ago this spring, Siegel was a counterculture  
catalyst, the man whose exhortation to ``Take the park!'' was the 
precursor to a bloody clash between University of California 
students and police that left one man dead, another blinded and a 
city locked in martial law. 
</P>
<P>
	So much has changed since, but Siegel's commitment to the  
struggle over who should control People's Park -- the university 
officials who paid for it or the community activists who 
transformed it -- remains. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you get older, you get a sense of history,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	People's Park began quietly.  
</P>
<P>
	The university purchased its 2.8 acres in 1967 as a dorm site.  
Officials bulldozed a line of apartment buildings then left the lot 
to devolve into a muddy, rutted eyesore that was used as an 
informal parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Berkeley's thriving activist community, born of the  
1964 Free Speech Movement and fortified by anti-Vietnam fervor, had 
decided the spot would make an excellent park for ``the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, leaders put an ad in the underground Berkeley Barb  
urging people to come to the park -- ``the trip belongs to whoever 
dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, 1969, hundreds of people responded, putting on a  
backbreaking demonstration of flower power as they dug a pond, laid 
sod and put up play equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy Schlesinger, a student activist at the time, would later  
write in her journal: ``I could hardly believe my eyes. Right in 
the middle of anarchist, polarized, confused Berkeley, people got 
themselves together instantly without any director.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The harmonious convergence didn't last long.  
</P>
<P>
	Early the morning of May 15, Siegel, then a second-year law  
student living a block from the park, walked out to pick up his 
newspaper and saw highway patrolmen watching work crews build a 
chain-link fence around the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegel wasn't sure what was going on but knew he didn't like it,  
so as president-elect of the student body he took the microphone at 
the regular noon rally on campus and began to speak ``very 
generally although heatedly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then fate took a hand. Just as he delivered the line about  
taking the park, university police yanked the power to the sound 
equipment, turning what had been just another line into a clarion 
call for action. 
</P>
<P>
	When the marching protesters ran into a line of sheriff's  
deputies clad in riot gear, ``all hell broke loose. It was totally 
out of control,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies fired shotguns at protesters. One, James  
Rector, who was watching from the roof of a theater, died a few 
days later; an artist was blinded. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Chanin, now an Oakland lawyer, was near the theater when the  
shooting started. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw people who were bleeding. It was like you'd see in some  
sort of totalitarian country,'' he says. ``It was like, here I was 
brought up in the '50s -- Mom, Dad, apple pie -- and I'm seeing 
something that is completely at odds with that. It was only later 
that I became really angry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Ronald Reagan sent 2,000 National Guard troops to occupy  
the city for 17 days. A nightly curfew was imposed. Meetings of 
more than three people were banned. In the first week after the 
riot, 1,000 people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Images from those days of thunder: Helmeted guardsmen clutching  
bayoneted rifles form a long, serpentine line across a campus 
plaza, inches from students; a helicopter flying low over campus, 
spewing CS tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Colvig, a retired university spokesman, remembers reporters  
coming into the public affairs office bleeding from buckshot wounds 
and filing their stories ``in true war correspondent fashion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, anti-war demonstrators tore down the fence and over the  
years the park turned into a sort of no-man's land. From time to 
time, the university would try to assert its property rights only 
to be met with vigorous protest. 
</P>
<P>
	By the early 1990s, the park had fallen into decay, a weedy lot  
frequented mainly by transients and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	But over the last few years, volunteers and city departments  
that manage the park for the university have cleaned up the trash, 
chased out the drugs and brought the lawns and shrubs back to life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful place,'' says Lisa Stephens, who has led the  
effort to revive the land and is helping organize a 30th 
anniversary celebration on April 25. 
</P>
<P>
	On this afternoon, scruffy teen-agers separate two snarling dogs  
near office workers enjoying a noontime break while several young 
men lounging around the ``free box'' clothes donation area make 
catcalls to passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Kehoe, taking his daily walk through the park, says he'd  
like to see more students venture into the park from the Berkeley 
campus two blocks away. Still, ``for what purposes the park serves, 
I think it's doing its job,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking back, Siegel sees himself as older and wiser, but still  
crusading for change through his practice -- he often takes on the 
university in employment cases -- and in his position on Oakland's 
school board. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like I imagined I would feel 30 years into the  
future in 1969,'' he says. ``I feel energetic and enthusiastic and 
optimistic, and taking on the state of public education in Oakland 
is probably no more foolhardy or ambitious than taking on ending 
war in Vietnam.''

<HEADLINE> Williams Hears Saints' Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- After facing the fans and media on draft day,  
next weekend's New Orleans Saints minicamp should be a breeze for 
Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the first thing I need to do is go in there and show  
the veterans that I'm going to go out there and work as hard as 
they do,'' Williams said. ``Show them that I'm not going to be just 
an overpaid rookie, but I'm going to be a football player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing Williams doesn't have to do is convince his coach.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Ditka donned shoulder-length dreadlocks to welcome  
Williams to the Saints on Sunday. And he told about 4,000 fans -- 
most of whom wore ``We got Ricky'' T-shirts, chanted, screamed for 
autographs and snapped pictures -- that Williams was the key to 
getting to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was more modest.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say I'm a savior,'' he said. ``Life's a puzzle, and  
hopefully I can be the missing piece to that puzzle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans, which hasn't had a winning record in six years or a  
1,000-yard rusher in a decade, traded away every pick after the 
first one this year, and its first- and third-round picks next year 
to get the Heisman Trophy winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We drafted him because he is a great football player. I don't  
think the Saints have had an identity football player, really, 
since Archie (Manning),'' Ditka said. ``He's the first marquee 
player this organization has had in a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka, who joked he'd had his hair restyled Sunday morning to  
celebrate getting the big back with the distinctive hairstyle, 
compared Williams to Walter Payton, the Hall of Fame back who 
carried the Chicago Bears and Ditka to glory in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said that was an exaggeration, insisting he just plays  
hard and loves doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just run the ball and try to get to the end zone, and  
whatever happens in-between is just pretty much all instinct,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans has back-to-back 6-10 records under Ditka. Last  
year, the offense was ranked 28th in the NFL -- dead last in yards 
rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting Williams will change that, Saints officials believe.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is one player who's going to make our football team a lot  
better on offense,'' said general manager Bill Kuharich. ``He's 
going to help our tight ends, our wide receivers, our quarterback 
and our offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an awful lot of pressure to say that one player can get  
us to the Super Bowl. But if he can carry us on his back, God bless 
him. But I'm not putting undue pressure on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the pick puts enormous pressure on everyone in the  
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka promised when he took the job that he would only stay  
three years if he could not turn the team into a winner. Now, with 
the sacrifice of eight potential players over two years, he's 
betting everything on Williams sparking a turnaround in the worst 
offense in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, he's going to be huge if he can get into the season  
healthy,'' said quarterback Billy Joe Hobert. ``It's going to be 
good for the fans, and it's going to be good for us. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, we're just going to move it on. No excuses now. We better  
go on to the playoffs or every one of us is going to be finding a 
new job next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' association with rapper Master P and No Limit Sports,  
which represents him, was reportedly one reason the Indianapolis 
Colts passed on him with the fourth pick. But the Saints and 
William's agent, Leland Hardy, said they expect no problem working 
out a contract. Hardy added he knows what he's looking for.

	``I think Mr. Williams should have a contract commensurate with  
his station as the greatest player in the history of the sport in 
the college game,'' Hardy said. ``Talk about his signability is of 
non-interest to me because all parties here are going into 
negotiations with a common interest. And that is to get Ricky 
Williams signed and in camp on time and try to get this football 
team to the playoffs and the Super Bowl as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on what Chicago Bears rookie running back Curtis Enis  
received in the No. 5 slot last year, Williams would get a five- or 
six-year contract worth about $2 million per season. The deal will 
include a signing bonus in the range of $7.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Habit of Dirt-Eating Is Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- As a nurse, Rena Bronson knows eating dirt can  
cause anemia, constipation and serious liver and kidney damage. But 
that doesn't seem to matter when her body starts yearning for those 
crumbly white chunks of clay. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 10-year, $1.48-a-bag kaolin habit has left the 51-year-old  
woman lethargic, isolated and chronically constipated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have much of a social life anymore,'' she said. ``It's  
more important I get home to get my fix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dirt eating, or geophagy, goes back thousands of years. The  
ancient Greeks ate clay to fight a variety of ailments. About 2,000 
years later, the practice continues, especially among poor folks in 
rural middle Georgia -- where most of the world's kaolin comes from. 
</P>
<P>
	Women, pregnant women in particular, say the white clay settles  
their stomachs. Ms. Bronson says the taste is hard to describe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you know how the ground smells when it's real dry and along  
comes a little sprinkle of rain -- that fresh smell? If you could 
taste a smell, that's how I would describe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most people expect it to be gritty, but it's creamy smooth.  
</P>
<P>
	``Technically, I'd rather eat dirt than food,'' she said. ``If I  
could eat dirt for breakfast, dirt for lunch, dirt for dinner and a 
little iced tea I'd be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is, no matter what name you call it -- dirt, clay, or  
chalk -- kaolin simply isn't supposed to be eaten. The fine white 
mineral is used in papermaking, paint products, ceramics, 
fiberglass and stomach-soothing medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia produces about 8 million tons of kaolin a year -- or half  
the world's supply -- making it easy for Ms. Bronson and an untold 
number of others to find. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people just go out and dig in their yard. But I've seen  
it at convenience stores, stores in black neighborhoods, gas 
stations,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it says right on the package that it's a novelty  
item `not for human consumption,' sometimes you'll find it with the 
vegetables at the grocery store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sweet Auburn farmer's market in downtown Atlanta, for  
example, piles its Ziplock packages of white dirt in a basket next 
to the peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
	People who eat kaolin are not addicted and are not suffering  
from a psychiatric disorder, according to R. Kevin Grigsby, a 
social worker and professor of psychiatry and health behavior at 
the Medical College of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, little is known about this particular form of pica  
-- the term used to describe the persistent eating of nonfood items. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many types of pica -- eating burned matches, ice and,  
in this case, earth,'' said Grigsby, the primary author of a recent 
study on kaolin eating in central Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Grigsby said he and his colleagues discovered they were delving  
into uncharted territory with the study, featured in the February 
issue of the Southern Medical Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has really studied kaolin-specific pica,'' he said.  
``What we discovered was people were very reluctant to talk about 
chalk eating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bronson was no exception.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's embarrassing for me. It's embarrassing for my family. But  
if it can help someone, I'm willing to put up with that 
embarrassment,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bronson, the oldest of 13 children, remembers seeing her  
mother eat kaolin while she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mama would give us 15 cents and say, `Go up to so-and-so's  
house and get me some chalk,'' she said. ``Naturally, as a child 
you're going to taste it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She made it through two pregnancies without giving white dirt a  
second thought. It wasn't until years later that she found herself 
pinching a piece here and there. Eventually, she started buying 
bags of her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the sudden, I'd say within a year, it was like -- `I  
want that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she said she goes through about three bags a week.  
</P>
<P>
	Grigsby's study found that dirt eating was most common among  
black women in rural areas who were introduced to it by a relative. 
</P>
<P>
	The study stressed that physicians need to be made aware of the  
behavior and said additional research was needed to determine the 
scope of the problem and the extent of its health repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't reached the point yet where I sit down and tell  
myself I am not going to do this anymore,'' Ms. Bronson said. 
``Once I do, then I feel reasonably sure I just won't do it.''

<HEADLINE> Telecom Italia in Alliance Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA confirmed late today it is  
considering an industrial alliance with Deutsche Telekom AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia ``is examining with Deutsche Telekom a hypothesis  
of industrial alliance, the elements of which are still being 
evaluated,'' the former Italian state monopoly said in a 
much-awaited but terse statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the event that an accord is reached, it will have to be  
deliberated upon by the relevant statutory bodies,'' it added 
without elaborating further. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about a possible deal between the two  
telecommunications companies has been swirling after published 
reports last week. If a deal is reached, it could be the biggest 
merger in history, beating the pending $73.7 billion linkup between 
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	To pull off their merger, Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia  
would first have to win the approval of the Italian and German 
governments and the European Commission's antitrust department. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement Sunday was in apparent response to a request by  
Italian stock market regulator Consob, which asked Telecom to state 
whether it was in merger talks with the German company.

<P>
	Earlier Sunday, Deutsche Telekom declined to comment on a report  
in German financial Handelsblatt that the two companies planned to 
fold their stock into a new telecommunications holding company on a 
60-40 percent basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would be worth nearly $200 billion.  
Deutsche Telekom has a market capitalization of about $117 billion, 
far bigger than Telecom Italia's $77 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian prime minister's office has said, however, that an  
eventual accord must be on an equal footing. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia, currently the target of a hostile takeover bid  
by Olivetti SpA, has been actively seeking alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti proposed in February to buy Telecom Italia for $58  
billion and later sweetened its bid to $65.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's tender offer prospectus is expected to be approved by  
Consob within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	According to press reports Sunday, Telecom Italia's board will  
meet on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Solidifies Derby Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Charismatic blew by Yankee Victor in the  
final furlong and solidified a Kentucky Derby trip by winning 
today's $378,000 Coolmore Lexington Stakes at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic was third behind Yankee Victor and pacesetter Texas  
Glitter around the second turn. As Texas Glitter faded in the final 
quarter-mile, Charismatic surged past Yankee Victor on the outside, 
drawing away for a 2 1/2-length victory in the last major Kentucky 
Derby prep race. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, a 12-1 shot, ran the 1 1-16 miles in a  
stakes-record 1:41.06, paying $26.20, $10.20 and $6.20. Yankee 
Victor paid $6.40 and $4, while Finder's Gold, trained by Bob 
Baffert, was three-quarters of a length farther back and paid 
$4.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Glitter, the favorite in a 12-horse field, finished tenth,  
more than 20 lengths off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer D. Wayne Lukas said he told Charismatic's owners, Bob  
and Beverly Lewis, Saturday that he wanted to run the colt in the 
May 1 Kentucky Derby regardless of whether he won or lost on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wouldn't have mattered how he ran,'' Lukas said, adding  
that he thought Charismatic had the earnings needed to get into the 
expected 20-horse Derby field even before his $235,000 Lexington 
Stakes payday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Jerry Bailey followed Lukas' instructions to keep  
Charismatic a little closer to the lead pack than he normally 
might, moving him to fourth by the half-mile, third at the 
three-quarters and into second behind Yankee Victor at the top of 
the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a textbook ride,'' Lukas said. ``It just unfolded  
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic is expected to need a new mount for the Derby, as  
Bailey has committed to ride Worldly Manner for the Maktoum family 
of the United Arab Emirates at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey rushed off to make a flight to New York and was not  
available for comment, but Lukas said the jockey made a tantalizing 
remark as he left. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Don't do anything until you talk to me,''' Lukas  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas said he has spoken to Laffit Pincay Jr. about riding  
Charismatic. However, Pincay, who is chasing Bill Shoemaker's 
career wins record, is slated to ride several favorites at 
Hollywood Park on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding a jockey for Charismatic after Sunday's performance  
shouldn't be too hard, the trainer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the phone will start ringing,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Holmgren Conservative in NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- In his first NFL draft as general manager  
and coach of the Seattle Seahawks, Mike Holmgren didn't do anything 
drastic, as New Orleans' Mike Ditka did by trading eight draft 
picks for Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	But he seems to have had a solid draft. And he emulated the man  
he first worked for, Bill Walsh, with minor deals that netted him 
the players he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Saturday's selection of defensive end Lamar King of  
Saginaw Valley State (Mich.) in the first round and Washington 
quarterback Brock Huard and Auburn wide receiver Karsten Bailey in 
the third, the Seahawks got two more defensive players, an 
offensive lineman and a specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth round, they drafted defensive end Antonio Cochran  
of Georgia with the 115th selection. In the fifth round, they got 
6-foot-4, 333-pound tackle Floyd Wedderburn of Penn State and punt 
returner Charlie Rogers of Georgia Tech at No. 152. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in the sixth round, Holmgren packaged Seattle's two picks  
and traded them to Cleveland for the Browns' first pick in the 
round, to get Steve Johnson, a cornerback from Tennessee's national 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	Wedderburn was rated by some as one of the top offensive linemen  
available, but he dropped because of weight problems and knee 
injuries. Rogers is considered a handy utility man who can play 
wide receiver and running back as well as return kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren's only regret: No tight end.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got the returner,'' Holmgren said. ``I got a little nervous  
because I had targeted two tight ends and I lost them both. 
</P>
<P>
	``My resident gurus were sitting there and I asked them if  
Johnson would be available when we drafted and they said, `Sure.' I 
said, `You told me that for those tight ends.' Then I said, `Let's 
trade the two picks up to Cleveland. I don't want to miss this 
guy.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Fritz Shurmur, Holmgren's defensive coordinator, was  
particularly happy with the addition of the 6-3, 273-pound Cochran 
to go along with Saturday's addition of King. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we talk about defensive linemen, we stay away from the  
undersized guys,'' Shurmur said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren took the coaching job in Seattle -- signing an  
eight-year contract for $4 million a season -- so he could have the 
team's GM job, too. This weekend, he didn't have Packers GM Ron 
Wolf calling the shots over him. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said he enjoyed his first draft as No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had a great time,'' he said. ``It was fun. The difference  
was as guys were coming off the board in years past, I didn't get 
so nervous. This year, I took it personally.''

<HEADLINE> Compaq President, CFO Both Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Without notice and with little explanation,  
Compaq Computer Corp. president and CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer resigned 
today along with the company's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's board formed an interim chief executive's office  
to handle day-to-day operations of the world's largest supplier of 
computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Also resigning Sunday was Earl Mason, Compaq's chief financial  
officer. Compaq treasurer Ben Wells will take on Mason's duties at 
least on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been under tremendous pressure from stockholders  
since it stunned Wall Street on April 9 by announcing its 
first-quarter earnings would be half of what analysts expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq shares, which traded as high as $51.25 earlier this year,  
dropped 23 percent on April 12, the first day of trading after the 
announcement. Compaq closed Friday at $23.62 1/2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compaq has the best team anywhere in the industry -- we have  
the people necessary to make the right changes that will reinforce 
our industry leadership,'' chairman Benjamin M. Rosen said. ``We 
have re-energized this company before, and working together, we 
will do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said that Mason will take over a company ``in an  
unrelated industry.'' Pfeiffer did not disclose his immediate 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compaq has come a long way since I joined the company in  
1983,'' Pfeiffer said. ``We are a world leader in personal 
computing, enterprise computing and Internet applications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer, who took over as CEO in October 1991, was a key reason  
why Compaq had taken over the top spot in terms of PC sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Compaq has struggled to assimilate fellow computer maker  
Digital Equipment, which it acquired last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's announcement earlier this month stunned many analysts  
who thought the company's profits were on track. Officials said 
sales were $600 million lower than expected in the first quarter, 
in large part due to industrywide price-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	The company already has hired executive search firms to find  
permanent replacements for Pfeiffer and Mason.

<HEADLINE> MedPartners Sustains Calif. Branch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A group of health plans and MedPartners  
Inc. will guarantee an initial $50 million to sustain the company's 
troubled California subsidiary as part of a tentative deal with the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, meant to ensure uninterrupted medical care to  
more than 1 million patients and payment to their doctors, should 
be finalized by April 24 if approved by all parties, according to 
documents filed last week by MedPartners with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tentative deal, Alabama-based MedPartners would have  
control over the day-to-day management of its California 
subsidiary, MedPartners Provider Network, with continuing 
bankruptcy court supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	MedPartners would provide a $25 million letter of credit as  
security for its obligations, and health maintenance organizations 
have agreed to provide a loan totaling up to $25 million to the 
company, SEC documents show. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 9, state regulators seized MPN, a middleman between  
health maintenance organizations and providers such as hospitals 
and physician groups. The takeover forced the network to file for 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department of Corporations officials contend the network  
kept the bare minimum in the regulated portion of its business to 
meet state requirements in an attempt to cover up huge operational 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The $50 million guarantee, when coupled with the proceeds from  
the sale of MPN, will ensure payment for patient care as the 
company leaves the physician practice management business, said 
MedPartners spokesman Robert Mead. 
</P>
<P>
	MedPartners anticipates paying about $100 million, in addition  
to the sale of network assets, to settle its obligations in 
California, Mead added.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Expects a New Cycle / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After the great bull market of the 1990s on Wall  
Street, the way investors look at cycles in the U.S. economy will 
never be the same again. 
</P>
<P>
	More than eight years have passed since the last recession in  
this country. Yet the economy lately has been acting as though a 
new growth phase is just beginning, rather than showing any signs 
of peaking. 
</P>
<P>
	The old idea that booms always set the stage for their own  
collapse has been seriously challenged. In particular, the 
optimists declare, the current expansion has proven that strong 
growth doesn't have to cause a revival of inflation and a 
tightening of credit conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists hasten to add that none of this means the cycle  
of growth, retrenchment and recovery has been abolished forever. 
What the current situation does demonstrate, they assert, is that 
each cycle is different from all previous ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Entering its ninth year of uninterrupted growth, the U.S.  
economy shows none of the danger signs that have presaged the end 
of previous economic expansions,'' says Davis Resler, chief 
economist at Nomura Securities International in New York. ``If 
anything, the economy has become even more robust with age. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. economy has shrugged off the deep and lingering  
recession in Asia, weathered a dramatic near-meltdown of the global 
financial markets, and even endured the impeachment of a president. 
The soaring stock market has been a perfect barometer of seeming 
invulnerability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The domestic economy has been especially strong over the past  
three years, just at the point when it appeared by many measures to 
have reached the limits of its capacity. Yet because inflation 
hasn't revived to date, the Federal Reserve hasn't felt compelled 
to adopt any sustained policy of credit-tightening. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, analysts say, new growth momentum appears to be building up  
with early signs of improvement in some overseas economies. ``Green 
shoots of cyclical revival are increasingly evident around the 
world,'' says Stephen Roach at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. is experiencing an incredible spending boom,''  
observes Bob Prince at Bridgewater Associates in Westport, Conn. 
``Up until the past few months this boom was offset by extremely 
weak exports. But in the past three months it has accelerated just 
as export demand has improved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That prospect raises some important concerns, including what  
might happen to commodity prices, labor costs and other components 
of inflation should the pace of business worldwide accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall,'' says Prince, ``conditions are contributing to  
rising pressures on the Fed to tighten. The markets are not 
prepared for such an event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some optimists on Wall Street argue that a quicker tempo  
could actually improve conditions in the stock market, where many 
issues have lagged behind over the past year while a few dozen blue 
chips have led the market indexes to new highs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. equity market has been a great place to be in the  
past several years, but only if you owned the right stocks,'' says 
John Manley, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few large-capitalization stocks with superior earnings  
growth have driven the market higher in a period of declining 
overall growth. But we are now seeing the first signs of a possible 
turnaround in earnings growth which, if sustained, could benefit 
value-oriented investment strategies.''

<HEADLINE> Compaq President, CFO Both Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. stunned the technology  
world again today, ousting chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer nine 
days after it warned Wall Street that first-quarter profits would 
be half expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer, the executive who built Compaq into the world's  
largest personal computer maker, has struggled to maintain profits 
while PC prices are plummeting. The company has also had difficulty 
integrating two acquisitions, Digital Equipment Corp. and Tandem 
Computers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this says is that things (at Compaq) are more screwed-up  
than even the results would have you believe,'' said Aaron 
Goldberg, vice president and principal analyst at Ziff-Davis Inc. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer resigned Sunday, one day after the board of directors  
told him they wanted new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl Mason, Compaq's chief financial officer, also resigned  
Sunday. While the company called his move unrelated, the two 
departures will mean broad changes in Compaq's leadership as it 
copes with the biggest challenge since its founding in 1982 as an 
upstart to then-dominant IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg predicted more executives will leave.  
</P>
<P>
	Compaq said on April 9 that it expected to earn 15 cents per  
share in the first quarter on revenue of $9.4 billion -- $600 
million lower than expected. First-quarter results are due out 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Compaq, which traded as high as $51.25 earlier this  
year, dropped 22 percent on April 12, the first day of trading 
after the announcement. Compaq closed Friday at $23.62 1/2 on the New 
York Stock Exchange, barely above its 52-week low of $22.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the increasing complexity and changes in our business  
have required a change in leadership,'' chairman Benjamin M. Rosen 
said in an interview Sunday. Rosen, Compaq's chairman since its 
founding, was named acting chief executive while the company 
searches for a permanent successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have re-energized this company before and, working  
together, we will do it again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Pfeiffer stuck to the positive. ``Compaq has  
come a long way since I joined the company in 1983,'' he said. ``We 
are a world leader in personal computing, enterprise computing and 
Internet applications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said Mason was leaving because he was offered ``every  
CFO's dream: to be chief executive officer of a company.'' He 
didn't identify the company, other than to say that it was in a 
different industry. Compaq treasurer Ben Wells will take on Mason's 
duties on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer took over as CEO in October 1991 and also held the  
title of president. His belief in a computer run by a Microsoft 
Windows operating system and powered by an Intel microchip help 
solidify the ``Wintel'' platform as the dominant one in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Compaq shipped 12.8 million computers worldwide to gain  
14 percent of the market, according to the research firm Dataquest 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But Compaq has struggled to maintain profits in an environment  
in which prices are dropping fast and sales of personal computers 
for under $500 -- or even less -- are growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq sells computers through a traditional distribution  
structure that includes resellers who act as a middleman and take a 
share of the profits. This has placed it at a disadvantage against 
companies such as Dell Computer Co. and Gateway Inc., which sell 
directly to customers by phone or over the Internet and allow 
customers to create any kind of system they want. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq has faced difficulty emulating this model. Analysts said  
it has alienated its resellers who are apt to see Compaq as a 
potential sales rival and instead may focus on selling other 
companies' brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen indicated Compaq will continue to allow customers a choice  
in how they buy computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feeling now is that we shouldn't dictate how a customer  
buys a computer, whether it's directly, through a value-added 
reseller or through the Internet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said Compaq is well-positioned as a major player on the  
Internet, but Goldberg said the company has done little to take 
advantage of the Net so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the NFL draft: You have 31 guys based on potential,  
but haven't done anything yet. Compaq has tremendous potential but 
hasn't done anything yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq has also said it plans to boost the computer services it  
offers business customers as a way to shore up declining profits 
from computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to its woes, analysts say Compaq's purchase of Digital  
Equipment last year for $9 billion, has yet to pay off. Sales of 
Digital's minicomputers -- medium-sized corporate computing systems 
that are smaller than mainframes -- have disappointed Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Compaq has had its hands full swallowing Tandem  
Computers, which it bought in 1997. Tandem makes computer systems 
with technology that helps clusters of computers run together and 
continuously, overcoming such problems as power failures.

<HEADLINE> Artist Wins MTV VJ Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An aspiring artist from Florida beat out 6,000  
other aspiring video jockeys for an instant taste of fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Thalia D. DaCosta, 21, of Sunrise, Fla., won MTV's nationwide  
search for a VJ on Saturday. Tryouts had been held in Los Angeles, 
Chicago and New York between April 6 and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Five finalists were tested on their music knowledge, poise and  
stamina live on MTV on Saturday. Viewers voted for the winner over 
the phone and in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just won a contest for being myself,'' Ms. DaCosta said. ``I  
was really a struggling, starving artist yesterday. And today, I 
have .... a really well-paying job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The competition, the second annual VJ ``Wanna-Be'' tryout, was  
open to people 18 to 28 years old. Last year, Jesse Camp, of 
Granby, Conn., stole the show and spent a year as a host on the 
cable music network. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. DaCosta is taking home $25,000 and a new car. Her salary has  
not been determined yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Sirulnick, the executive vice president of MTV news and  
production, said Ms. DaCosta's first VJ shift will come next week.

<HEADLINE> Bob Beamon To Start Track Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Bob Beamon, whose winning long jump at  
the 1968 Olympics stood as the world record for 23 years, was 
chosen to launch a track and field program at Florida Atlantic 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Beamon, 52, was introduced Saturday as the school's director of  
development for track and field. The title is similar to one held 
at Florida Atlantic by Howard Schnellenberger, who is working to 
start a football program in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	FAU will field its first women's track team next spring, with  
the men's program to follow in 2001. The women's team is forming 
first to help comply with gender equity regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The addition of someone of Bob Beamon's stature shows how  
quickly Florida Atlantic's athletics program is maturing,'' said 
athletic director Tom Cargill, who brought Schnellenberger to 
direct football operations and recently hired former NBA player 
Sidney Green to coach men's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Beamon stunned the world with his leap of 29 feet, 2 1/2 inches to  
win the gold medal in Mexico City, shattering the previous mark by 
nearly two feet. The mark stood until Mike Powell jumped 29-4 1/2 at 
the 1991 World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Atlantic is Beamon's first Division I coaching position.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is just another challenge,'' he said. ``If my dreams can  
happen to me, your dreams can happen to you. Champions are not made 
on the track or field; champions are made by the things you 
accomplish and the way you use your abilities in everyday life 
situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beamon previously worked with the Miami-Dade County Parks and  
Recreation Department and started several youth programs.

<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- New England player-coach Walter Zenga made  
a handful of brilliant saves in regulation but allowed four goals 
in the shootout as the Columbus Crew beat the Revolution 1-0 
Saturday night in the MLS. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern John, Brian McBride, Jeff Cunningham and Jason Farrell all  
scored in the shootout for Columbus (3-1), while Kris Kelderman 
converted the lone goal for the Revolution (1-3). 
</P>
<P>
	Three of New England's four matches this season have been  
decided by a shootout, prompting the crowd to chant ``No more 
shootouts'' prior to the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, played at a breakneck pace with little imagination or  
control by either side, was punctuated by missed scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew had the better of the play, but missed two easy chances  
in the opening minutes and a handful of golden opportunities later 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	John, a Trinidad &AMP; Tobago international, failed to finish in the  
first minute of play and then was foiled by a masterful goalkeeping 
demonstration by Zenga. After Zenga kicked out a bid by McBride, he 
snuffed a 6-yard blast from John at 36 minutes and a minute later, 
stopped a shot by John from 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution failed to create more than a couple of legitimate  
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 53rd minute, Edwin Gorter threaded a pass to Johnny  
Torres, whose shot from 12 yards was headed off the line by Crew 
midfielder Todd Yeagley. Six minutes later, the Revolution nearly 
scored when Joe-Max Moore was put through by Tony Kuhn only to 
shoot wide along the left post from 16 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	At 69 minutes, John headed down a cross from substitute Ansil  
Elcock only to have McBride put the ball over the bar from seven 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew in the midst of seven straight road games as they await  
the completion of their new, soccer-specific stadium, are 10-3 
all-time against New England.

<HEADLINE> Water Shortage Risks Widespread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	You know it's dry when Sunbelt retirees start watering the  
cactus. 
</P>
<P>
	When mountain lions and other skittish wildlife emerge from the  
pinion scrub of the Sonora Desert to lap greedily from chlorinated 
swimming pools and fountains. 
</P>
<P>
	When a wall of wildfire 10 miles wide blackens a swath of  
Nebraska prairie the size of Rhode Island, stampeding cattle and 
forcing the midnight evacuation of a ranching town. 
</P>
<P>
	When Catholic priests and Baptist preachers hold prayer vigils  
in withered cotton fields and cracked, sage-choked reservoir 
basins, raising their arms to beseech the same clear blue heavens 
for a drop of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	And this was supposed to be an easy year.  
</P>
<P>
	After all, the record El Nino of 1998 is long gone. However,  
scientists say 1999 is shaping up to be another year of 
unpredictable, destructive, weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Portions of the South and Midwest are being strangled by a  
spotty but tenacious drought that has been gripping parts of the 
nation for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Gov. George W. Bush has declared a state of emergency  
in 170 of the state's 254 counties. His order comes nine months 
after a 1998 drought cost his state $10.4 billion in agriculture 
losses alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to be outdone, his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, declared  
his own drought emergency on April 13 and ordered the National 
Guard to help combat red-alert wildfire conditions for the second 
consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	By the weekend, gusty winds fanned flames across 6,000 acres,  
forcing the evacuation of nearly 1,000 residents across Florida. In 
Port St. Lucie, 60 houses burned Friday; fire reduced one 
neighborhood to ashes and a few charred refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all or nothing,'' said Mark Svoboda, a forecaster with  
the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Neb. ``For some 
places, the dryness has become an intense event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one is certain how much worse the drought will get.  
</P>
<P>
	It's been so dry that recent blizzards and thunderstorms have  
not been enough to slake the drought in many areas. Long-range 
forecasts by several federal agencies agree that dry conditions 
could persist with a vengeance throughout the Sunbelt and portions 
of the Midwest until July. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we get into a drought, we don't know how long it will  
last,'' said climatologist Kelly Redmond of the Desert Research 
Institute of Reno, Nev. ``That's because we don't have a good 
handle on why drought occurs. You can't predict something well if 
you don't know why it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem lies in forecasters' difficulty in analyzing  
what isn't happening in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Meteorologists can spot thunderstorms, blizzards and tornadoes  
snarling on the electronic horizon of their Double Doppler radars. 
And they behave according to a logic that is becoming more apparent 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
	But drought is the consequence of an accumulation of nonevents --  
the absence of storms, a lack of rainfall. A standard definition is 
a 30 percent drop in precipitation for three consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the dog not barking in the night,'' Redmond said. ``It's  
too many nice days in a row. By and by, you notice that something 
hasn't happened in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like rain.  
</P>
<P>
	Once established, drought is likely to persist for months, or  
years. Increasingly, scientists are looking into the past for clues 
as to when droughts start and stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies of climate trends spanning the past 10 centuries  
indicate that immediately following El Nino episodes, North America 
has periodically suffered cataclysmic droughts and wildfires that 
would make the Dust Bowl look lush. 
</P>
<P>
	We're overdue, scientists warn. And its impacts could be  
exaggerated by record high temperatures in the 1990s that some 
believe are the result of global warming caused by human 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're heading into a very, very dangerous situation,'' said  
University of Arizona tree ring expert Tom Swetnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really off the scale.''  
</P>
<P>
	This year, climate experts blame conditions on the opposite of  
El Nino -- La Nina. 
</P>
<P>
	Like its surly weather twin, it too is generated by a  
continent-sized pool of water in the equatorial Pacific that 
conspires with the atmosphere to disrupt storm patterns around the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
	But La Nina's characteristics are opposite of El Nino's. Its  
waters are cold rather than warm, and it occurs less frequently and 
predictably. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997-98, El Nino's waters simmered at a record 9 degrees  
above normal. It left southeast Asia and Australia parched and 
decimated fisheries along the Pacific coastline from British 
Columbia to Chile. At the same time, it nearly submerged California 
in rain and mudslides while delivering copious rains to Arizona 
that nourished the best wildflower bloom in a generation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Texas and Florida sizzled with disastrous results all summer  
long. 
</P>
<P>
	When the record El Nino finally collapsed, the climate pendulum  
swung into a cold-water La Nina in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	It has reversed conditions in Asia, bringing chest-high  
floodwaters to India. Forecasters expect a vigorous hurricane 
season in the Caribbean this fall, too. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, La Nina has pushed the jet stream north.  
Weather patterns cleave the nation roughly in half, tracing the 
Interstate 80 corridor between New York City and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The southern half of the country generally is drier than normal,  
especially Arizona and New Mexico -- no wildflowers this year. But 
to forecasters' consternation, Texas and Florida remain dangerously 
dry again despite the switch to La Nina. 
</P>
<P>
	Circumstances north of I-80 couldn't be more different.  
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Mount Baker is poised to break the all-time North  
American snowfall record of 1,122 inches, or 93.5 feet of 
cumulative snow, that fell at Mount Rainier during the winter of 
1971-72. 
</P>
<P>
	Reservoirs are brimming, and downstream communities and farms  
face late-spring flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're fat with water,'' Redmond said, gazing out his window at  
the Sierra Nevada swaddled in a deep, white, icy blanket. ``But the 
further south you go, the worse it gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You don't have to remind George Davies.  
</P>
<P>
	Brown slopes on Mount Lemmon near Tucson forced the manager of  
Ski Valley to close the two chairlifts serving the nation's 
southernmost ski area for the first season in its 40-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	A foot of snow on April Fools' Day only aggravated matters; too  
skimpy for skiing, but it closed the only road to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan on one bad year in every five years,'' Davies said.  
``But I never thought that I would have a zero year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty miles and 6,000 feet downhill in Tucson, conditions have  
been remarkably dry even for the desert oasis. 
</P>
<P>
	The April Fools' storm sprayed more than an inch of cold rain on  
the city and surrounding rangeland. Until then, the area had 
received 0.01 inch of moisture since autumn. Precipitation remains 
80 percent below normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures as high as 90 degrees have driven early season  
water consumption to midsummer levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar conditions grip cities across the nation's southern  
tier, including Albuquerque, El Paso and San Antonio. Even humid 
Houston has been relatively dry. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Diego, entrepreneurs have suggested bringing supertankers  
full of fresh water from the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Naples and other Florida cities are debating water restrictions.  
Birds and other wildlife in the Everglades National Park are 
suffering in a parched ecosystem that already is the subject of an 
intensive restoration following decades of water diversion by Big 
Sugar and other farm interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucson is especially vulnerable.  
</P>
<P>
	Its water utility started in the 19th century by delivering bags  
of spring water by burro to the barrios and mining camps. The city 
continues to suck water from its desert aquifer to irrigate thirsty 
golf resorts and subdivisions much faster than sporadic storms can 
replenish it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no place to go for more water,'' utility director  
David Modeer said. ``La Nina complicates everything we're doing. If 
the summer monsoon is late, we'll have a real problem meeting 
demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Circumstances are no better for farmers.  
</P>
<P>
	In Texas alone, last year's El Nino drought cost farmers and  
their suppliers $10.4 billion, and 10 percent of growers went 
bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Many regions across the state -- including areas near Abilene,  
Big Spring, San Angelo, Lubbock and Midland -- received below 
average rain this winter, and spring rains have been spotty. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are planting seed in case the rains return, but it's a  
make-or-break year for many. The same is true for crop processors 
and farm suppliers. A Littlefield, Texas, cotton mill laid off 500 
workers in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all bleak,'' said Texas A&AMP;M economist Carl G. Anderson.  
``Farmers aren't very mobile. For them, it's a very slow process, 
but it becomes overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drought is raising immediate dangers, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of forest and range fires have been sparked since  
February, prompting federal officials to redeploy crews, tanker 
planes and funding from the wet North to the dry South. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, where 500,000 acres were roasted last summer, 1,650  
wildfires have burned more than 35,000 acres and several homes so 
far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	With humidity levels dipping to a desert-dry 20 percent, the  
state's index of fire potential has soared above 600 -- 400 denotes 
significant danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in very dangerous, high-burn conditions,'' said state  
Fire Services deputy chief Frank Pocica. 
</P>
<P>
	And the danger is spreading. Last week, fires forced Georgia to  
evacuate campers from Stephen Foster State Park and briefly close a 
major highway north of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of residents in eastern Tennessee and western North  
Carolina were evacuated as fires burned 4,000 acres and a pair of 
vacation homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In central Nebraska's sandhills, the second-largest wildfire in  
state history consumed 78,000 acres of prairie on March 19-20, 
killing one firefighter and hundreds of cattle. The town of 
Thedford was evacuated as the fire licked residents' doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 9, a rare midwinter grass fire northeast of North  
Platte, Neb., scorched 15,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	The most ominous fire zone is the Four Corners states -- Arizona,  
New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's mountain snowpack is 97 percent below normal in some  
ranges. Residents of isolated, but congested cabin communities are 
jittery after receiving unprecedented midwinter fire warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should a conflagration occur, it would be impossible to  
evacuate people except by helicopter,'' said Mount Lemmon real 
estate broker Dick Bloomfield. ``There are many places that you 
can't get in with a fire truck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The losses would run deeper than just cabins. Forests are choked  
with so much dry fuel that a windswept inferno would incinerate all 
plant life. When rains return, soils that took 100,000 years to 
accumulate would be flushed into streams, carving gullies 40 feet 
deep in moments. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire experts have documented that over the past 1,000 years,  
huge wildfires burned during dry La Nina episodes that immediately 
followed wet El Ninos. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the worst years: 1575, 1748, 1851 and 1879.  
</P>
<P>
	It's a natural cycle, but the added risks of 100 years of  
fire-prevention efforts and population growth means the ecological 
and economic costs of wildfire this year could be among the highest 
in the past millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thousands of firefighters could slow it down here and there,''  
said Swetnam, the University of Arizona tree ring expert. ``But 
some of these forests that burn may not come back.''

<HEADLINE> Gretzky's Masterpiece Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He played the game with such style and grace, it  
brought tears to the eyes. When he left hockey, it was Wayne 
Gretzky who couldn't keep from crying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough game for me today,'' Gretzky said of his  
farewell from the game he dominated for two decades. ``I wanted it 
to be a celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, this is not a passing on,'' he added, his eyes  
watery for perhaps the 100th time Sunday. ``This is a moving on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a moving scene as the sport's greatest player said  
goodbye. The NHL also said goodbye to No. 99, which commissioner 
Gary Bettman announced would never be worn in the league again. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a gentlemen told me in 1977 to wear this sweater, I  
didn't imagine one day nobody else would be allowed to wear it,'' 
Gretzky said, referring to Murray (Muzz) MacPherson, his coach with 
the Soo Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore it with as much class as any superstar in any sport.  
Gretzky was universally acknowledged throughout his 21-year career 
as the best; never was that respect more apparent than in his final 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always too soon when you see a great player retire,''  
said Mario Lemieux, the only man ever to perform anywhere near 
Gretzky's level. ``It's going to be very difficult for the National 
Hockey League to lose the best hockey player that ever played, and 
he's been such a great ambassador for the game for 20 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In front of Lemieux -- who retired for health reasons in 1997 --  
Mark Messier, Glen Sather, Paul Coffey and many more former 
teammates and opponents who revered The Great One, Gretzky set up 
the New York Rangers' only goal in a 2-1 defeat. The game ended 
abruptly in overtime when Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr scored, which 
somehow seemed appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's only fitting that the best young player in the game  
scored the winning goal,'' Gretzky said. ``Everyone always talks 
about passing torches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, Gretzky smiled through tears during four final  
laps of Madison Square Garden. The greatest player ever made it 
easy for everyone to say goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	He skated slowly enough for plenty of souvenir photos to be  
taken. Whenever he noticed a youngster's extended hand from the 
crowd, he touched it. He even played to the fans, donning a blue 
Yankees hat, then a red Rangers beret. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, almost as suddenly as word had come last week that he was  
retiring, No. 99 was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm devastated I will no longer be a hockey player,'' Gretzky,  
his eyes still red, said more than an hour after his final skate. 
``I will miss every part of the game, because I loved every part of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I've made the right decision.''  
</P>
<P>
	That decision led to a Garden party almost as energized as the  
night in 1994 when the Rangers broke a 54-year Stanley Cup drought. 
Gretzky wasn't on hand for that, but Messier -- still the most 
popular of all Rangers -- was. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned Sunday to pay tribute to his buddy.  
</P>
<P>
	``His whole career has been handled with complete class and  
dignity,'' said Messier, who left the Rangers as a free agent two 
years ago. ``We've established a friendship and a bond that's next 
to brotherhood and will be there forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Gretzky always seemed to be there, at the top of the  
scoring charts and in the spotlight as the game's unofficial 
ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, the player who shattered hockey's most revered  
records skated one lap around the rink with his teammates in tow, 
followed by an encore as a lone spotlight caressed him and Carly 
Simon's ``Nobody Does It Better'' blared throughout. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most excruciating moment for him came as Gretzky  
fought the tears, occasionally looking down at the ice, while 
posing for one last photo with teammates, who all wore No. 99 caps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to miss this game,'' he said. ``It's going to kill  
me not to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a timeout called by Rangers coach John Muckler with 40.4  
seconds to go in the third period, his wife, Janet, started to cry 
as the fans began a long salute to her husband. Gretzky, 38, 
acknowledged it with a nod, then a wave, then by raising his stick 
in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``When John called timeout, it hit me that I was done,'' he  
said, his eyes watering once more. ``Then is when it hit me that I 
had only 30 seconds left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the timeout, he nearly had a breakaway, but  
Pittsburgh goalie Tom Barrasso, who had a sensational game, beat 
Gretzky to the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' Gretzky said, this time with a twinkle in his eye. ``I  
thought I might have one there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proceedings began with Bettman's announcement, the first of  
several times Gretzky became teary. It happened again when his 
father, Walter, was driven to center ice in a new black Mercedes 
presented to Gretzky as a parting gift. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel so lucky to be able to play in the NHL,'' said Gretzky,  
owner of 61 NHL scoring marks. ``I've been so fortunate to play 
with some of the greatest players, against guys I admired so much, 
like the best player I ever played against, Mario Lemieux ... my 
teammates and, of course, the best player I ever played with, Mark 
Messier. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it would be nothing without family and the great  
friendships I have developed over the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky wore a huge grin as friend Bryan Adams sang ``O,  
Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss you, Wayne,'' Adams ad-libbed late in the  
song. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star-Spangled Banner,'' as sung by John Amirante, was  
altered to include the words ``in the land of Wayne Gretzky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the first television timeout, Gordie Howe, whose records  
Gretzky regularly broke, appeared in a video, saluting his prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sports icon, Michael Jordan, appeared in a second-period  
video, telling Gretzky, ``Your golf game is not going to get 
better, so don't think that will help. Relax and enjoy being a 
dad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, Canada's greatest sports hero, left Edmonton in 1988  
when he was traded to Los Angeles. He cried the day the trade was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	He said goodbye to Hollywood in 1996, dealt to St. Louis. But he  
soon signed with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has always been a special place to play,'' he said. ``I  
was so proud and happy I was able to come here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, performing as if he was in his prime, set up a  
half-dozen scoring chances in the first 39 minutes, but his 
teammates botched the ones Barrasso didn't stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the Rangers were able to convert his magic late in the  
second period. On a power play while trailing 1-0, Gretzky passed 
from the right wing boards to Mathieu Schneider in the slot. He 
faked a shot and passed to Leetch for a tap-in open-net goal. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to a mob scene at the sideboards as his teammates  
hugged, although Gretzky didn't seem very emotional. Of course, 
he'd done this 2,856 times before in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	But he will never do it again.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's time,'' he said, once again teary-eyed. ``I know it's the  
right time.''

<HEADLINE> 'Great' Gretzky Plays Last NHL Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Slowly circling the rink, soaking in the  
farewells from his fans, teammates, even opponents, Wayne Gretzky 
didn't want it to end. 
</P>
<P>
	Smiling through tears during four final laps Sunday, the  
greatest player ever made it easy for everyone to say goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	He skated slowly enough for plenty of souvenir photos to be  
taken. Whenever he noticed a youngster's extended hand from the 
crowd, he touched it. He even played to the fans, donning a blue 
Yankees hat, then a red Rangers beret. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, almost as suddenly as word had come last week that he was  
retiring, No. 99 was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm devastated I will no longer be a hockey player,'' Gretzky,  
his eyes still red, said more than an hour after his final skate. 
``I will miss every part of the game, because I loved every part of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I've made the right decision.''  
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's grace and skill could bring tears to the eyes of  
anyone watching him perform. On the last day of his unparalleled 
career, it was Gretzky who cried the most. 
</P>
<P>
	``I broke down a couple of times, once at the end of the game  
and once when I saw Ulfie,'' he said of former Rangers defenseman 
Ulf Samuelsson, who like several of his ex-teammates attended the 
festivities. ``They were tears of joy, because I was thinking about 
all the fun things that happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, the player who shattered hockey's most revered  
records skated one lap around the rink with his teammates in tow, 
followed by an encore, as a lone spotlight followed him around the 
ice and Carly Simon's ``Nobody Does It Better'' blared throughout. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most excruciating moment for him came as he fought  
the tears, occasionally looking down at the ice, while posing for 
one last photo with teammates, who all wore No. 99 caps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to miss this game,'' he said. ``It's going to kill  
me not to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Gretzky ended his career with an assist, setting  
up a second-period goal as his New York Rangers lost to Pittsburgh 
2-1 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	On the final shift of his 21-year pro career, with all the fans  
at Madison Square Garden on their feet cheering as if a Stanley Cup 
title was imminent, Gretzky did nothing special. That was rare, 
particularly on this day -- when he set up a dozen good scoring 
chances -- and for his unparalleled career. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Rangers timeout with 40.4 seconds to go in the third  
period, his wife, Janet, started to cry as the fans began a long, 
final salute to her husband. Gretzky acknowledged it with a nod, 
then a wave, then by raising his stick in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``When John called timeout, it hit me that I was done,'' he  
said, his eyes watering once more. ``Then is when it hit me that I 
had only 30 seconds left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the timeout, he nearly had a breakaway, but  
Pittsburgh goalie Tom Barrasso, who had a sensational game, beat 
Gretzky to the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' Gretzky said with a twinkle in his eye. ``I thought I  
might have one there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appropriately, as if his career just wasn't supposed to end now,  
the game went into overtime. But it ended abruptly when Jaromir 
Jagr, hockey's dominant player these days, scored. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's only fitting that the best young player in the game  
scored the winning goal,'' Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd and the Rangers seemed stunned, but only momentarily.  
Then everyone remembered why they'd come to an otherwise pedestrian 
matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	As the ``Gretz-ky'' chants began again, he skated over to the  
Penguins, who were lined up at the blue line, and shook hands with 
several. Then he hugged Jagr -- an unofficial passing of the torch? 
-- before returning to his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Then began the final moments of the Gretzky era, which NHL  
commissioner Gary Bettman ensured would end historically by 
announcing before the game that no one will ever again wear No. 99 
in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the first of several times Gretzky became teary. It  
happened again when his father, Walter, was driven to center ice in 
a new black Mercedes presented to Gretzky as a parting gift. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel so lucky to be able to play in the NHL,'' the sport's  
greatest player said. ``I've been so fortunate to play with some of 
the greatest players, against guys I admired so much, like the best 
player I ever played against Mario Lemieux ... my teammates and, of 
course, the best player I ever played with, Mark Messier. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it would be nothing without family and the great  
friendships I have developed over the years. I appreciate all the 
accolades. I tell everyone the greatest place to play is right here 
in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky wore a huge grin as friend Bryan Adams sang ``O,  
Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss you, Wayne,'' Adams ad-libbed late in the  
song. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star-Spangled Banner,'' as sung by John Amirante, was  
altered to include the words ``in the land of Wayne Gretzky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who holds or shares 61 NHL records, set up Brian  
Leetch, John MacLean and Niklas Sundstrom for first-period scoring 
chances. All failed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first television timeout, Gordie Howe -- whose records  
Gretzky regularly broke -- appeared in a video, saluting his 
prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sports king, Michael Jordan, appeared in a second-period  
video, telling Gretzky, ``Your golf game is not going to get 
better, so don't think that will help. It will probably get worse, 
because you've got more time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, he set up MacLean for a semi-breakaway, but  
Barrasso stopped a slap shot. Then Gretzky broke in on a 2-on-1 
with MacLean, who held the puck too long for a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the Rangers were able to convert his magic. On a power  
play while trailing 1-0, Gretzky passed from the right wing boards 
to Mathieu Schneider in the slot. He faked a shot and passed to 
Leetch for a tap-in open-net goal. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to a mob scene at the sideboards as his teammates  
hugged, although Gretzky didn't seem very emotional. Of course, 
he'd done this 2,856 times before in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Something he'd rarely done, wince in embarrassment, might have  
been appropriate midway through the third period. The scoreboard 
showed a clip from a television special on which Gretzky sang -- 
sort of -- ``The Devil Went Down to Georgia.'' Everyone on both 
benches watched the video, but they all had the good sense not to 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	The first ovation, when Gretzky was introduced by master of  
ceremonies John Davidson, was accompanied by a three-minute salute 
that seemed to make the man of the moment most uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he skated to the Penguins bench and shared hugs and  
handshakes with several players as the rhythmic applause continued. 
He even pointed to the crowd at banners that said ``Thanks for the 
Memories,'' ``Always in Our Hearts: No. 99'' and ``Gretzky the 
Greatest Forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his family standing at center ice, along with teammates  
Leetch, Adam Graves and Jeff Beukeboom, Edmonton Oilers president 
Glen Sather was introduced. Gretzky shared a hug with his former 
coach, and then did the same with Lemieux, who retired in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, Canada's greatest sports hero, left Edmonton in 1988  
when he was traded to Los Angeles. He said goodbye to Hollywood in 
1996, dealt to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came to the Rangers -- already hockey's biggest star  
everywhere else -- he rejoined Messier, who was New York's leader 
and had helped the team win its first Stanley Cup in 54 years. When 
Gretzky left Sunday, Messier was on hand, too, and they stood 
together soaking up the biggest cheers of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to be on the ice with him again,'' Gretzky said.  
``He came here and showed people you can handle the pressure, which 
is something we loved to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everywhere at the Garden, fans wore No. 99 Rangers jerseys.  
Painted behind each net was a blue 99, so appropriate for the area 
known as ``Gretzky's office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A pregame light show featured spinning 99s projected onto the  
ice along with Gretzky's image; a short video of his career, also 
shown on the rink surface; and even a taped scoreboard message from 
The Great One thanking the fans for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne's father, who built an ice rink in the back yard ``for  
self-preservation -- I would freeze when I took him to skate on the 
ponds'' -- expects his son to make a clean break from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first few months, he's going to play golf,'' Walter  
Gretzky said. ``I know he'll never be a coach or general manager; 
they have the tough jobs. TV? I doubt that very much. You have to 
be at a certain place at a certain time, and he didn't even play 
the game that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He played the way nobody ever has. Or might ever play it again.

<HEADLINE> 'Life' Bumps 'Matrix' at Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Eddie Murphy-Martin Lawrence prison  
comedy ``Life'' pulled in $20.7 million in its opening weekend at 
the box office, bumping the sci-fi adventure ``The Matrix'' down to 
second place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life,'' which features Murphy and Lawrence as innocent men who  
use humor to cope with life sentences at a notorious Mississippi 
prison farm, had the year's third-highest opening, according to 
estimates by Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an impressive showing for Murphy, who seems to suffer a  
flop after each success. His ``Holy Man'' bombed last fall with a 
paltry total gross of $12 million, while ``Dr. Dolittle'' garnered 
$144.1 million during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The success comes from a combination of both stars,'' said  
Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal, which released the 
film. ``They play well off each other. It's just a good time, 
without the special effects and action of other films.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix'' took in $18.1 million during the weekend. The  
futuristic Keanu Reeves thriller, about a computer hacker who 
discovers humans are the unwitting slaves of machines, has earned 
$99.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the end of spring break, young audiences also flocked to  
the Drew Barrymore high school comedy ``Never Been Kissed,'' which 
had $8.7 million for third place. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the box office has been languishing in a  
post-''Titanic'' funk for most of the year, the popularity of those 
top three films pushed the weekend's ticket sales 13 percent higher 
than the same weekend last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the end of spring break may have harmed other youth-oriented  
films such as ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' the loose adaptation 
of Shakespeare's ``The Taming of the Shrew.'' It lost 27 percent of 
its audience in its third week and was fifth with $3.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The critically praised rave-scene film ``Go'' lost 36 percent of  
its business to finish seventh with $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Howard's comedy ``EDtv,'' one of the year's biggest  
disappointments, plunged 51 percent to collect only $1 million with 
a paltry per-location average of $655. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations, with final figures to 
be released Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Life,'' $20.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``The Matrix,'' $18.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $8.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Analyze This,'' $4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' $3.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``The Out-Of-Towners,'' $3.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Go,'' $3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Forces of Nature,'' $2.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $1.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Cookie's Fortune,'' $1.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Boston Home for Patriots Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino says he's willing to  
back a stadium for the New England Patriots in Boston if the team's 
deal in Connecticut falls through. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Menino said there was no site in the city that was  
suitable for a Patriots stadium. But after a group of civic leaders 
went public Friday with a last-minute campaign to block the 
Patriots' move to Hartford, Conn., Menino said the stadium could be 
located on an old incinerator site south of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a new man,'' Menino told The Boston Globe. ``I'm an  
individual who doesn't close his mind to opportunities. If I have 
an opportunity to listen and to be convinced, I'm there to listen 
and be convinced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The civic leaders opposing the move to Hartford have the support  
of the NFL, which prefers that the team remain in the Boston area, 
the sixth largest television market in the country, rather than 
relocate to Hartford, where smaller audiences would mean less TV 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL recently approved new financing that could help defray  
the costs of constructing a new stadium for Kraft and other 
big-city team owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Even House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, who did not approve a  
deal last year to put the Patriots in a new stadium in Foxboro, was 
receptive to league officials when they paid him a visit Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it is far from certain that the Hartford deal will  
collapse and give Massachusetts another shot at retaining its 
football franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	After new stadium plans for South Boston and Foxboro were  
rejected, Kraft struck a $374 million accord with Gov. John Rowland 
of Connecticut that is considered the most lucrative deal ever for 
an NFL owner. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agreement has been plagued by ongoing problems with the  
Hartford site and questions about whether the stadium would be 
completed by 2002, when Kraft wants it to be ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of their preliminary agreement, Kraft can decide to  
abandon the Connecticut proposal by the end of April.

<HEADLINE> Starr Mulls Next Whitewater Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutor Kenneth Starr said Sunday the  
decision by a Little Rock, Ark., jury to acquit former Clinton 
business associate Susan McDougal may be linked to the ``horrible'' 
effects his investigations of President Clinton and the first lady 
have had on the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a Little Rock trial,'' Starr said on ABC's ``This  
Week.'' ``This is difficult for the state of Arkansas. A sitting 
governor has been convicted and resigned. The president's business 
partners, the first lady's clients have been convicted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said his office has asked the Arkansas court for  
permission to interview the jurors in the McDougal case, and would 
not make a decision on a retrial on two remaining counts until 
after that is done. 
</P>
<P>
	Some jurors said they thought Starr's prosecutors were arrogant,  
and they acquitted her on an obstruction of justice charge partly 
on that basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would take that with a grain of salt,'' Starr said, noting  
that the comments were made only by a few jurors. ``But I will say 
this,'' he said, ``this has been horrible for Arkansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's investigations into Clinton's Whitewater land dealings  
have led to former Gov. Jim Guy Tucker pleading guilty to fraud, 
convictions against McDougal and her late husband James McDougal 
and friend Webster Hubbell, and charges against other Arkansas 
bankers and businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan McDougal last week was acquitted of the obstruction of  
justice charge stemming from her refusal to talk to Starr about her 
dealings with Clinton. The jury deadlocked on two criminal contempt 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also repeated his statements he made at a Senate hearing  
last week that he believes the independent counsel law is flawed 
and should not be renewed when it expires June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that rather than have an independent counsel's office,  
the attorney general should appoint and be accountable for special 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is, there is no mechanism to judicially check the  
attorney general's exercise of her authority under this statute. It 
is a false hope,'' Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Newsweek poll of 751 adults found 35 percent said Starr did a  
good job in handling the Monica Lewinsky matter, and 54 percent 
said he did a bad job. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll released Sunday also found that 35 percent said the  
independent counsel law should be extended, while 58 percent 
supported its termination. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage  
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said U.S. District Court Judge Susan Webber Wright was  
``extremely well reasoned'' in her opinion holding Clinton in 
contempt of court for giving false statements about his affair with 
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	But he would not comment on whether the decision would lead to  
his indicting Clinton. ``There are very serious issues with respect 
to a sitting president,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Water Polo Team Stripping for Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's national water polo team,  
trying to raise enough money to get to the world championships, is 
promising ``The Full Monty'' in a one-time-only striptease show. 
</P>
<P>
	The unlikely male strippers hope to earn the $32,000 needed to  
travel to Essen, Germany, in May with next Thursday's show at a 
disco. Only women will be admitted, at $12 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea, inspired by the 1997 British movie about oddball male  
strippers in unemployment-stricken Sheffield, England, came from a 
team member's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	A poster advertising Thursday's show features five naked  
players, shown from neck to knee, with the single player facing 
forward covering his groin with a water polo ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have the best bodies. But we're prepared to take it  
all off for just one night,'' the poster says. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes are taking two hours a day away from practice -- for  
dancing lessons with a ballet teacher.

<HEADLINE> Ways of Fish, Presidents Run Deep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fish, said Grover Cleveland, are constantly  
engaged in the most mysterious and startling enterprises ``and no 
one has yet been wise enough to explain their ways or account for 
their conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same goes for fishermen. Especially those who, like  
Cleveland, have ascended the political fish ladder to become 
president of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In rippling mountain brooks and lazy southern ponds, in salt  
water and fresh, in hip boots and crisp three-piece suits, 
presidents have gone fishing since George Washington became the 
First Angler. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential fishermen include Hoover and Eisenhower, Coolidge  
and Carter, both Roosevelts, William Howard Taft, Chester Arthur, 
Benjamin Harrison, John Quincy Adams, George Bush, Cleveland in a 
big way and Harry Truman when no poker game was available. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Clinton has not been known to bait a hook during his tenure  
in the White House, but he did fish in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Now comes Bill Mares, fly fisherman, teacher and former Vermont  
legislator, to wade through the dark waters of presidential 
libraries, archives, diaries, letters and memoirs and return with 
virtually every presidential fish story ever told. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: ``Fishing With the Presidents, An Anecdotal  
History,'' published by Stackpole Books in Mechanicsburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, like most anglers, fished with mixed results.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1751, when he was just 19 and sailing to Barbados, he  
recorded in his journal: ``A dolphin we catchd at noon but cou'd 
not entice with a baited hook two baricootas, wich played under our 
stern for some hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Constitutional Convention took a break in the sultry  
Philadelphia summer of 1787, Washington, the presiding officer, 
revisited his army's old retreat at Valley Forge -- and went fishing 
for trout and perch. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, finding himself luckless of the Maine coast, Washington  
gave a local fisherman a silver dollar for a freshly hooked cod. 
</P>
<P>
	Some presidents, Mares reports, were fishing philosophers.

	``Fishing is great discipline in the equality of men, because  
all men are equal before fish,'' said Herbert Hoover. He also 
remarked that presidents were allowed only two zones of privacy -- 
prayer and fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Other chief executives were absolutely determined to fish, come  
what may. 
</P>
<P>
	George Bush's ear was painfully hooked on ``a perfect day for  
bluefish.'' A Secret Service agent snipped off the barb and the 
fishing continued. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that had been in the eyeball, I guess we would have gone  
in, but it wasn't, and we didn't,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the modern era, photographers engulf fishing presidents like  
a swarm of blackfiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd be in so tight it was like trying to troll in a  
Mixmaster,'' Bush once griped. 
</P>
<P>
	As president, the disabled Franklin Roosevelt spent hours  
fishing from a launch lowered from a Navy cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't give a continental damn whether I catch a fish or  
not,'' the president once said. But no one believed him. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, presidents were in the age of public relations and  
being a fisherman was thought to help the image. 
</P>
<P>
	When Roosevelt ran against Hoover in 1932, humorist Will Rogers  
concluded that the campaign ``will be settled on fish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you want a deep-sea fisherman (Roosevelt) in the White  
House -- flounders and cod -- or a big trout and perch man?'' Rogers 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Coolidge essentially learned how to fish while president.  
Ever frugal, he once asked a Wisconsin guide whether he should use 
the whole worm for bait or cut it in half. The guide said to 
splurge and use three. The president's Secret Service agent 
remembered a day when, after losing a fish, Coolidge uttered a most 
uncharacteristic four-letter expletive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guess I'm a real fisherman now. I cussed,'' the president  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some presidents, like some people, are, of course, simply not  
born to fish. 
</P>
<P>
	Before plunging into the 1952 campaign, Dwight Eisenhower, a  
competent fisherman, took running mate Richard Nixon on a 
fly-fishing outing in Colorado. Ike lost his famous grin in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``After hooking a limb the first three times, I caught his shirt  
on my fourth try,'' Nixon recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a disaster.''

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Hoops Squad Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHANHASSEN, Minn. (AP) -- Investigators looking into alleged  
academic fraud within the University of Minnesota men's basketball 
program were expected to meet Monday with the former director of 
the school's academic counseling unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Elayne Donahue last week released a long memo she wrote alleging  
the basketball program received preferential treatment from 
high-ranking university officials on academic issues under pressure 
from coach Clem Haskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue said she went public with the information because she  
was concerned the investigators would overlook allegations not 
reported in the media, since they had not contacted her up to that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the investigators, outside attorneys Donald Lewis  
and Michael Glazier, met for a fourth time with the woman whose 
allegations prompted the investigation, former office manager Jan 
Gangelhoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Jim Lord, who represents Gangelhoff and Donahue, said  
the investigators reviewed more of the estimated 400 pieces of 
course work Gangelhoff says she did for Gopher players, and for the 
first time discussed a $3,000 tutoring payment she says came from 
Haskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff has said academic counselor Alonzo Newby told her the  
money he handed her in June of 1998 came from Haskins and was 
payment for tutoring Antoine Broxsie during spring quarter that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins has denied paying Gangelhoff while Newby hasn't  
commented publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jan told investigators that after she was given the money she  
called Alonzo to tell him that she had received it,'' Lord said 
after the nearly five-hour session at his suburban office. ``Then, 
(Newby) told her that coach Haskins `was quite pained to have given 
up that much money.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lord said much of the course work has yet to be reviewed, but no  
date had been set when Gangelhoff would be interviewed again. Lord 
also said it hadn't been decided when the investigators would meet 
with Jeanne Payer, Gangelhoff's sister, who has said Newby gave her 
the $3,000 to give to Gangelhoff.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Renews Offer for CNG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Columbia Energy Group renewed its effort  
today to buy Consolidated Natural Gas Co., despite a stock deal 
announced in February for Dominion Resources Inc. to acquire the 
Pittsburgh-based gas supplier. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy's $6.68 billion offer represents a 33.5 percent  
premium above CNG's closing share price and a 21 percent premium 
above Dominion Resources' offer. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hunter Applewhite, a spokesman for Dominion Resources, said  
the Richmond-based utility holding company already has a definitive 
merger agreement with CNG. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dominion Resources has the strength to offer the convergence  
of both electric and gas services to customers now and in the 
future,'' Applewhite said in a prepared statement. ``This makes our 
combination a superior one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Columbia Energy offer of $70 for each CNG share consists of  
$24.50 in Columbia Energy shares and $45.50 in cash. Columbia 
Energy would also assume $2 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver G. Richard III, chairman, president and chief executive  
officer of Columbia Energy, called his company's proposal ``a 
compelling combination for the shareholders and customers of both 
companies'' that would leave the combined business in a position 
``to prosper in the emerging deregulated energy industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we are uniquely positioned to capture the full  
value of a combination with CNG and are hopeful that we will have 
the opportunity to explore such a merger more fully,'' Richard 
wrote in a letter to George A. Davidson Jr., chairman and CEO of 
CNG. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy had offered $66 to $70 a share for CNG two days  
before the deal with Dominion Resources was announced Feb. 22, 
according to Richard's letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to believe a combination of our two companies  
would be an excellent financial and strategic fit,'' Richard wrote 
in seeking formal merger talks. ``... We have adequate sources of 
financing and therefore our proposal is not subject to any 
financing conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter said the offer would be withdrawn May 3 if no  
favorable response is received. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Donovan, a spokesman for CNG, acknowledged the company had  
received the offer and said its board of directors ``will review it 
in due course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNG's deal with Dominion Resources was valued at $6.3 billion  
when it was announced, though is now worth about $5.5 billion. The 
merger would create a company serving nearly 4 million customers 
with $8.8 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	CNG shares closed Friday at $52.43 3/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Columbia Energy closed at $48.25 Friday, while shares  
of Dominion Resources closed at $38.06 1/4, both also on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy, based in Herndon in the northern Virginia  
suburbs of Washington, had 1998 revenues of nearly $6.6 billion. 
Its natural gas business includes exploration and production, 
transmission, storage and distribution, as well as propane sales 
and electric power generation. It serves customers in 34 states and 
the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	CNG supplies natural gas to 1.9 million customers in Ohio,  
Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. It also owns 7,600 miles 
of gas pipelines in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, West 
Virginia and Maryland. It had 1998 revenue of $2.76 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominion Resources, the parent company of electricity supplier  
Virginia Power, had $6 billion in revenues last year. It has 
operations in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Argentina, 
Belize, Bolivia and Peru.

<HEADLINE> Littlebitlively Beats Real Quiet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas (AP) -- Littlebitlively held off a stretch  
run by 1998 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Real Quiet on 
Sunday and won the $250,000 Texas Mile for the second straight 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the eighth victory in 26 career starts for the horse  
trained by Bobby Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet, trained by Bob Baffert and with Gary Stevens riding  
for the first time, caught Littlebitlively at the top of the 
stretch but couldn't put him away. Urged on by jockey Carlos 
Gonzalez, the winner surged back to beat Real Quiet, the 2-to-5 
favorite, by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just got outrun,'' Baffert said. ``A mile is just not his  
game. Longer races are his style and you can't change him. If Gary 
had rushed him he would have come up empty. It's just one of those 
deals. I was pleased with it. I would have liked to win but he got 
beat. If you get outrun, you get outrun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said Real Quiet just got beat.  
</P>
<P>
	``Real Quiet got the lead at the turn so we have no excuses,''  
Stevens said. ``Littlebitlively is a tough little horse. We knew we 
would be in a battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Littlebitlively, which paid $7.40 to win, loves the Lone Star  
Park track, Barnett said, and blinkers helped him concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had some good works and (owner John Franks) and I decided  
it might be good for him if we put him in blinkers,'' Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez said Littlebitlively had plenty left at the end.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just kept trying to get him to relax,'' Gonzalez said. ``I  
think the blinkers really made the difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens was aboard Victory Gallop which beat Real Quiet by a  
nose at the Belmont Stakes last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens replaced Kent Desormeaux on last year's champion  
3-year-old. Stevens is the primary jockey for Baffert but was the 
rider on Silver Charm for many races last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the shortest race for Real Quiet who had never won a race  
at a distance of less than 1 1-16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Krone, who retired after the day's racing, finished third  
on Allen's Oop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Littlebitlively showed a lot but we almost caught him and Real  
Quiet,'' Krone said.

<HEADLINE> Judy Collins Talks About Addiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Judy Collins says just saying ``no'' is  
just not that easy. 
</P>
<P>
	The folk singer says the famous anti-drug campaign wrongly looks  
at drug and alcohol addiction as a character flaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``It assumes that those who are locked up because of it just  
didn't have the willpower to carry out their plan for the 
evening,'' Collins told The Tennessean in an interview published 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she knows from personal experience that addiction is  
not a choice and is often inherited. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, a former alcoholic who has abstained from liquor and  
drugs for 20 years, said she began drinking as a 15-year-old to 
mask the shame and pain that her own father's alcoholism caused 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	Her only son, Clark, a drug addict and an alcoholic, killed  
himself in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have an illness,'' she said of addicts. ``My desire is to  
talk about the public education about this disease and about how 
far short it falls.''

<HEADLINE> Habit of Dirt-Eating Is Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- As a nurse, Rena Bronson knows eating dirt can  
cause anemia, constipation and serious liver and kidney damage. But 
that doesn't seem to matter when her body starts yearning for those 
crumbly white chunks of clay. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 10-year, $1.48-a-bag kaolin habit has left the 51-year-old  
woman lethargic, isolated and chronically constipated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have much of a social life anymore,'' she said. ``It's  
more important I get home to get my fix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dirt eating, or geophagy, goes back thousands of years. The  
ancient Greeks ate clay to fight a variety of ailments. About 2,000 
years later, the practice continues, especially among poor folks in 
rural middle Georgia -- where most of the world's kaolin comes from. 
</P>
<P>
	Women, pregnant women in particular, say the white clay settles  
their stomachs. Ms. Bronson says the taste is hard to describe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you know how the ground smells when it's real dry and along  
comes a little sprinkle of rain -- that fresh smell? If you could 
taste a smell, that's how I would describe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most people expect it to be gritty, but it's creamy smooth.  
</P>
<P>
	``Technically, I'd rather eat dirt than food,'' she said. ``If I  
could eat dirt for breakfast, dirt for lunch, dirt for dinner and a 
little iced tea I'd be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is, no matter what name you call it -- dirt, clay, or  
chalk -- kaolin simply isn't supposed to be eaten. The fine white 
mineral is used in papermaking, paint products, ceramics, 
fiberglass and stomach-soothing medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia produces about 8 million tons of kaolin a year -- or half  
the world's supply -- making it easy for Ms. Bronson and an untold 
number of others to find. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people just go out and dig in their yard. But I've seen  
it at convenience stores, stores in black neighborhoods, gas 
stations,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it says right on the package that it's a novelty  
item `not for human consumption,' sometimes you'll find it with the 
vegetables at the grocery store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sweet Auburn farmer's market in downtown Atlanta, for  
example, piles its Ziplock packages of white dirt in a basket next 
to the peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
	People who eat kaolin are not addicted and are not suffering  
from a psychiatric disorder, according to R. Kevin Grigsby, a 
social worker and professor of psychiatry and health behavior at 
the Medical College of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, little is known about this particular form of pica  
-- the term used to describe the persistent eating of nonfood items. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many types of pica -- eating burned matches, ice and,  
in this case, earth,'' said Grigsby, the primary author of a recent 
study on kaolin eating in central Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Grigsby said he and his colleagues discovered they were delving  
into uncharted territory with the study, featured in the February 
issue of the Southern Medical Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has really studied kaolin-specific pica,'' he said.  
``What we discovered was people were very reluctant to talk about 
chalk eating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bronson was no exception.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's embarrassing for me. It's embarrassing for my family. But  
if it can help someone, I'm willing to put up with that 
embarrassment,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bronson, the oldest of 13 children, remembers seeing her  
mother eat kaolin while she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mama would give us 15 cents and say, `Go up to so-and-so's  
house and get me some chalk,'' she said. ``Naturally, as a child 
you're going to taste it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She made it through two pregnancies without giving white dirt a  
second thought. It wasn't until years later that she found herself 
pinching a piece here and there. Eventually, she started buying 
bags of her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the sudden, I'd say within a year, it was like -- `I  
want that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she said she goes through about three bags a week.  
</P>
<P>
	Grigsby's study found that dirt eating was most common among  
black women in rural areas who were introduced to it by a relative. 
</P>
<P>
	The study stressed that physicians need to be made aware of the  
behavior and said additional research was needed to determine the 
scope of the problem and the extent of its health repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't reached the point yet where I sit down and tell  
myself I am not going to do this anymore,'' Ms. Bronson said. 
``Once I do, then I feel reasonably sure I just won't do it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Milosevic Is 'Tyrant' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton branded Slobodan Milosevic a  
``belligerent tyrant'' and said Sunday the Yugoslav president could 
not be part of any democratic transition by his nation into a free 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing in a London newspaper, Clinton said NATO airstrikes that  
began March 24 will continue until Milosevic's Serb forces are too 
weak to fight in Kosovo or until he agrees to peace and autonomy 
for the Serbian province's ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our campaign will continue, shifting the balance of power  
against him until we succeed,'' Clinton said in an opinion piece in 
the Sunday Times. ``Ultimately, Mr. Milosevic must either cut his 
mounting losses or lose his ability to maintain his grip on 
Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said NATO  
airstrikes at oil refineries, ammunition depots and Serb military 
command and control centers are ``wearing down'' Milosevic's 
military and choking off vital supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the administration is acting to prevent ``outside  
powers'' from delivering oil to the Serb military through ports in 
Montenegro, a second Yugoslav republic. Albright did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials also are giving an international war crimes  
tribunal evidence of suspected Serb atrocities. The information 
includes satellite photos of mass graves and reports of ethnic 
Albanian women being raped and civilians slaughtered. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, blaming Milosevic, said on ABC's ``This Week'': ``It  
is harder and harder to imagine the U.S. could negotiate with 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Albright repeated the administration's position against  
using ground troops, members of Congress said that stand only helps 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``To rule out any option obviously has to be nothing but an  
encouragement to Mr. Milosevic to hunker down, and it's distressing 
that we continue to not acknowledge that fact,'' GOP Sen. John 
McCain of Arizona, a presidential hopeful, said on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said lawmakers should ``push the  
president ... to muster up the courage'' to consider using ground 
troops to oust Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would see the end of the Milosevic regime as an objective,''  
Lugar said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not all lawmakers favor U.S. involvement in a Balkans civil  
war, let alone military escalation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not have any national security interests there, and we  
need to get out,'' Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said on CNN's ``Late 
Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has refused to arm the Kosovo Liberation  
Army, which has been fighting Yugoslav forces for independence 
since early last year. Still, every NATO strike on Serb tanks and 
artillery bolsters the KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a change in balance of forces on the ground,''  
Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that does not mean an independent Kosovo, said Clinton, who  
favors autonomy for the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kosovo lacks the resources and infrastructure to thrive on its  
own. Instead, its independence could actually spur more 
instability,'' Clinton wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Milosevic ``Europe's worst demagogue,'' Clinton said  
NATO hopes that one day Yugoslavia will join democratic Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The realization of this vision will require a democratic  
transition in Serbia itself, for the region cannot be secure with a 
belligerent tyrant in its midst,'' the president wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, Clinton spoke by phone with the leaders of four  
states bordering Yugoslavia: Hungary, a new NATO member, as well as 
Albania, Bulgaria and Romania, which are not in the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke of NATO's resolve and discussed ways to cooperate  
more closely on refugees and on a more united and democratic 
southern Europe down the road, said David Leavy, spokesman for the 
National Security Council. ``All these states have been quite 
responsible in standing with NATO,'' Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zivadin Jovanovic, Yugoslavia's foreign minister, called reports  
of Serb atrocities ``mere NATO propaganda'' aimed at justifying 
airstrikes. He denied ill treatment of any group. 
</P>
<P>
	``All citizens in Yugoslavia are safe, free and equal,''  
Jovanovic said on NBC. ``There is no killing, no raping, no 
depriving of anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the military front, the first of 24 Apache attack helicopters  
are arriving early this week in Albania after delays caused by bad 
weather and crowded airfields handling humanitarian missions for 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, is awaiting  
Pentagon approval for an additional 300 U.S. and allied planes, 
which would raise the alliance's total fleet to about 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	That will require Clinton to call up as many as 33,000 military  
reserves, mostly for refueling and administration duties. Pentagon 
officials expect that order early this week. 
</P>
<P>
	More low-flying A-10 ``tank-killer'' aircraft, which like Apache  
gunships are good at close-in attacks, are expected to be among the 
reinforcements.

<HEADLINE> 103rd Boston Marathon Is Set to Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Moses Tanui is the current king of the Boston  
Marathon and the unofficial mayor of Eldoret, Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	He will attempt to rule his domain in Boston again Monday in the  
103rd running of the world's most prestigious marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of pressure being the defending champion,''  
said Tanui, also the 1996 winner. ``Everybody is looking at me. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times I try to relax and not think about the race,  
but it's very difficult because it's on your mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kenya, the 33-year-old runner is a hero, with a long string  
of successes. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the 1991 10,000-meter world champion and set the world  
best performance for the half-marathon in 1993. He has run on six 
Kenyan teams that won the World Cross Country Championship and run 
on three Kenyan teams that won the World Half-Marathon 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He owns a large farm, surrounded by an enormous park, in the  
residential area of Eldoret. He provides jobs for many on the farm 
and advice and guidance for many young runners who lack financial 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	He founded the Great Rift Valley Cross Country race to develop  
the youngsters. He also joined six-time world cross country 
champion Paul Tergat in producing a running magazine, ``The 
Athlete,'' which gives rare insights into Kenyan athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	When he leaves Kenya for a race, he misses his people.  
</P>
<P>
	``I try not to think about it,'' he said. ``It's like I'm going  
for a fight. I want to finish what I've been training for. It would 
confuse my mind if I think about anything but the race. Winning 
depends on what you have in the head, not how fast you are. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to win three times ... and then four.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tanui will have a lot to think about during the race. If he wins  
again, he becomes the third Kenyan to win three times in 11 years, 
joining Ibrahim Hussein and Cosmas Ndeti, and the ninth consecutive 
Kenyan champion. 
</P>
<P>
	He also will have to think about the flock of first-class  
runners in the field of 12,775, the largest at Boston except for 
the race's centennial year in 1996, when there were 38,708, the 
most in the history of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the field will be Kenyans John Kagwe, winner of the  
past two New York City Marathons; Joseph Chebet, the runner-up to 
Kagwe at New York in 1997 and 1998 and second to Tanui last year; 
Joseph Kamau, the 1997 Boston runner-up; and Sammy Korir, winner of 
the past two Amsterdam Marathons. 
</P>
<P>
	The other contenders include Mexicans Andres Espinosa, the  
fastest man in the field at 2 hours, 7 minutes, 19 seconds, and 
Isaac Garcia. There's also Brazil's Vanderlei Lima and Spain's Jose 
Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's field is distinguished as well, led by two-time  
defending champion and 1996 Olympic gold medalist Fatuma Roba. 
</P>
<P>
	Also running will be NYC Marathon champions Franca Fiacconi of  
Italy, Anuta Catuna of Romania and Franziska Rochat-Moser of 
Switzerland; two-time Olympic medalist Yuko Arimori of Japan; 1998 
Boston runner-up Renata Paradowska of Poland; and first-time 
marathoners Lynn Jennings of Newmarket, N.H., and Catherine Ndereba 
of Kenya, both having achieved great success at shorter distances. 
</P>
<P>
	Another victory by the smooth-striding Roba would enable her to  
join Germany's Uta Pippig as the only three-time winners since 
women were officially allowed to compete in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Tanui, Roba is highly respected in her country.  
</P>
<P>
	``Children ... they want to be like me,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, Roba prefers the undulating Boston course to  
flatter terrain and thinks she can break the world record of 
2:20:47 by Kenya's Tegla Loroupe. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba is certain to be cheered loudly by the crowd, many from a  
large Ethiopian community in Boston. But the strongest support 
probably will be for Jennings, who has run in the area on numerous 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Boston crowd is very egalitarian,'' Jennings said. ``They  
will cheer for the people who've been there before. I have a lot of 
friends here, so I should hear a lot of cheering along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to use it to help me. It won't be a burden, it will  
be a plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings will need lots of support.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the babe in the woods,'' she said. ``I'm running against  
people who have run lots of marathons ... the creme de la creme of 
women marathoners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another big crowd favorite will be Bill Rodgers.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers, 51, has won at Boston and New York four times each, and  
will be aiming to break the over-50 course record of 2:31:34 for an 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to be a little younger so I could run well  
against all those Kenyans,'' Rodgers said. ``They have the most 
professional distance runners in the world.''

<P>
	Temperatures dipped to record lows from Texas to the Carolinas  
on Sunday, dropping nearly to the freezing point in places. Only 
light showers were scattered across other sections of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even northern Florida briefly flirted with frost, with a record  
low of 32 at Tallahassee, the National Weather Service said. 
Temperatures there earlier this month had been well above normal 
with highs in the 80s and 90s. The city's previous record was 37 
degrees in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures also hit record lows for April 18 in parts of  
Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and North and 
South Carolina, the weather service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those records included 34 at McAlester, Okla.; 33 at Meridian,  
Miss.; 35 at Austin, Texas, and 42 at Houston. New Orleans tied its 
record at 43. 
</P>
<P>
	South of the cold air mass, a few showers moved across southern  
Florida, not enough to quench the state's grass and brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther north, a few light showers were scattered across the  
Great Lakes and into New England during the afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Single Empire Wins Capistrano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Single Empire defeated Le Paillard by 1 1/4  
lengths to win today's $400,000 San Juan Capistrano Invitational 
Handicap, giving trainer Neil Drysdale a 1-2 finish in North 
America's longest Grade I turf race. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Kent Desormeaux, Single Empire covered 1 3/4 miles in  
2:45 4-5 and paid $5.80, $3.20 and $4.40 as the 9-5 wagering 
favorite. Single Empire, an Irish bred and co-high weight of 118 
pounds, took the lead at the head of the stretch over stablemate Le 
Paillard. 
</P>
<P>
	Le Paillard, another Irish bred, returned $5.20 and $4.40, while  
Lucayan Indian, yet another Irish bred, was another 4 1/2 lengths back 
in third and paid $8.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a marathoner,'' Desormeaux said. ``He's a two-miler, a  
true marathon horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drysdale had never won the San Juan Capistrano, although he was  
an assistant to Charlie Whittingham when the Hall of Fame trainer 
saddled the 1-2 finishers in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $240,000, increased Single Empire's career  
earnings to $824,113, with five wins in 15 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $109,400 La Cienegas Handicap for fillies and mares,  
Desert Lady caught Hula Queen at the wire to win by a head under 
Corey Nakatani and 117 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Desert Lady covered 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:13 2-5 and paid $4.20,  
$2.80 and $2.20. The victory, worth $65,640, increased her career 
earnings to $219,541.

<HEADLINE> 3 N.Y. Winners Take Aim at Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The winners of the last three New York City  
Marathons were strong contenders to capture the women's title in 
today's Boston Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	But something else connects Italy's Franca Fiacconi, Romania's  
Anuta Catuna and Switzerland's Franziska Rochat-Moser. All three, 
without hesitation, said Fatuma Roba would be the toughest to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba was favored to win her third straight Boston Marathon. Her  
time of 2 hours, 23 minutes, 21 seconds last year was the third 
fastest on the course by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-flight women's field was led by Roba of Ethiopia, the  
1996 Olympic gold medalist, and included Lynn Jennings, the top 
American woman distance runner who was making her official marathon 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
	But she wasn't expected to beat Roba.  
</P>
<P>
	``The 'Big Woman' is Fatuma,'' Catuna said. ``I think we'll stay  
together (in the race). I think I can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catuna won the New York City Marathon in 1996, when she overtook  
Tegla Laroupe -- who set the women's world mark of 2:20:47 at 
Rotterdam last year -- and finished in 2:28:28. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the year, Catuna trains in Boulder, Colo., where the  
roads are wide, the air is clean and the hills are abundant and 
prepare her for Boston's hilly course. 
</P>
<P>
	More than any other race, the 30-year-old Romanian said she  
enjoys running the Boston Marathon, citing its history and the 
competitiveness of its contestants -- particularly the strength of 
the women's field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to run the Boston Marathon,'' Catuna said.  
</P>
<P>
	Plus, she said, Boston is not as difficult as the New York City  
Marathon because New York has more hills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boston is easy,'' said Catuna, who placed third in Boston last  
year in 2:27:34. ``It has only four hills. In New York, they have 
plenty. Every two kilometers, there is (another) hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rochat-Moser disagreed and said both courses are challenging  
with little difference between them. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York and Boston are very hard,'' she said. ``I don't see a  
lot of differences, they are both very hilly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Catuna and Fiacconi, who focus much of their training for  
Boston on hill workouts, Rochat-Moser works on her quick pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have speed, the hills will come on their own,''  
said the 32-year-old who has been running long distances since she 
was just 10. ``I think the race will go very fast. There are a lot 
of good women here, fast women,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochat-Moser, who trains in Lausanne, Switzerland, also  
incorporates cycling workouts into her marathon training. She said 
she runs about 100 miles a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiacconi won New York last year in her personal best of 2:25:17  
and has not raced in any other marathons since. In 1997, she ran 
three marathons in 60 days. She placed third at New York, 13th at 
the World Championships in Athens, Greece, and second in Italy's 
Capri Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Since winning New York, the 5-foot-8 Fiacconi -- who towers over  
most of her competitors -- has spent much of her time on interviews, 
traveling and training. For the past two months, she has trained at 
her favorite spot, Rocca Canterano, a hilly area outside of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how fast the competition runs, Rochat-Moser believed  
Roba would be wearing the laurel wreath after the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's the Olympian,'' Rochat-Moser said. ``She runs very fast,  
and if she's in good shape, nobody can beat her.''

<HEADLINE> Architect Preaches Less Is More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Architect Sarah Susanka has a few catch  
phrases that leave little doubt of what she thinks about the 
4,000-square-foot homes many families are building. 
</P>
<P>
	She calls them ``starter castles'' and ``Sheetrock barns.''  
</P>
<P>
	Susanka has taken a sabbatical from her Minneapolis architecture  
firm to spread her message that today's smaller families don't need 
homes with grand foyers and master baths the size of some bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	She hopes to repopularize residential architecture, which waned  
in this country after the 1920s, and promote building ``not so 
big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The philosophy is on view in her own not-so-big house, which she  
designed and had built several years ago on a bluff above the 
Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-story, 2,400-square-foot walkout where she lives with  
her architect husband, James Larson, and two cats is cottage in 
scale with Oriental details. 
</P>
<P>
	It combines her native English penchant for window box seats and  
other nooks and crannies with an openness that makes the home seem 
bigger than it is. With three bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths, there's room 
for Larson's two adult children and grandchildren to visit. 
</P>
<P>
	The living, dining and kitchen functions are combined in a  
single space used for both formal and informal purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not for everybody,'' she acknowledged on a tour of her  
home. ``There are some people who still love to entertain formally. 
And if you do, I don't want to talk you out of your dining room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But too many people, Susanka maintains, use their dining rooms  
as a mail-sorting center. She created niches for that purpose near 
the front door by a half-bath and closet. The same area serves as a 
mudroom. 
</P>
<P>
	For people who need an acoustically separate room for a piano or  
some special pursuit, Susanka advocates an ``away'' room. This 
particular home plan can be modified for an older couple by 
converting a screen porch on the main floor into a bedroom or, for 
a family with children, by turning an extra large walk-in closet 
off the upstairs master bedroom into a third bedroom or nursery. 
</P>
<P>
	Although her own home is contemporary Prairie School, Susanka  
and her firm design homes of all styles with the not-so-big 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
	While Susanka's ideas are not unique, others in the field give  
her credit for making them work together and articulating them well 
in her book, ``The Not So Big House,'' which was published in 
mid-October by Taunton Press. It was Amazon.com's best-selling home 
design book last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The book tells readers to build only rooms that they use every  
day and save their money for wood floors, built-ins and other 
design details to give their homes character. 
</P>
<P>
	``What she is doing is starting to showcase a prevailing trend,  
that we're no longer building ego houses but jewel houses,'' said 
Jerry Gloss, a Boulder, Colo., architect and a member of the design 
committee of the National Association of Home Builders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten years ago we were doing the Texas two-story entry. We felt  
like we were building Tara,'' Gloss said. Susanka's book is a good 
summary and could wind up as a ``bible'' of the scaled-down 
movement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard McLaughlin, president of a Minneapolis planning and  
design firm, said Susanka's work is important because she can 
create small, intimate spaces within a home set on a narrower lot 
in a higher density development. 
</P>
<P>
	Susanka didn't begin her career designing homes and initially  
turned down requests to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sending them off to friends, who I knew would either  
moonlight them in the evenings or had started their own business. 
One day I was standing there and I was about to give my same 
friend's name out, and I thought `You know what? I could be doing 
this,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after that residential project, she went into  
partnership in 1983 with Dale Mulfinger, a faculty member at the 
University of Minnesota where she earned her master's degree in 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	Susanka estimates the homes being designed by her firm,  
Mulfinger, Susanka, Mahady &AMP; Partners, start at about $230,000 to 
build and have an average cost of around $350,000. Her firm also 
handles smaller projects, such as additions and kitchen redos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a lot of frustrated builders out there who  
want to do better-designed, better-looking, better-quality work but 
the mechanisms in our culture right now force everybody to go for 
lowest dollar per square foot,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she maintains that most people are looking for  
character, not square footage. She believes better-designed houses 
will last longer and retain their value even though they may lack 
some currently standard features, such as formal dining rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Susanka wants to convince the middle class that there are  
architects who are affordable, will listen to clients' wishes and 
help them decide what they really want in a home. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara and Harley Weyer worked with Susanka on their modern  
3,200-square-foot Craftsman-style home in Perry, Iowa, and 
pronounced it a great experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weyers, who would not disclose the cost of their home, said  
much of the square footage is devoted to a large storeroom on the 
walkout lower level. The rest of the house has a decidedly 
not-so-big feel, which they described as ``cozy, yet good for 
entertaining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the dining and living room spaces are really one  
medium-size room, exposed beams delineate the areas. The kitchen 
cabinets are maple with cherry accents, every window is trimmed in 
wood and the staircase is maple and cherry. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an absolute delight,'' Mrs. Weyer said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Federal Bank To Appeal Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California Federal Bank will appeal a $23.3  
million award to the savings and loan, calling the judgment 
``flawed.'' The bank originally had sought more than $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The $23.3 million award falls far short of CalFed's actual  
damages,'' spokesman Walter G. Montgomery said Sunday in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert H. Hodges Jr. of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims  
on Friday found the government breached its contract with CalFed. 
</P>
<P>
	The case stems from a 1996 Supreme Court decision that said the  
government broke its contract with thrift institutions when it 
changed the rules on how they must count their assets as part of an 
S&AMP;L bailout in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	CalFed said last week's decision is ``flawed'' and agrees  
``neither with applicable law nor with the extensive evidence and 
testimony presented at trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco-based Golden State Bancorp is the publicly traded  
parent company of CalFed.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Misses Giants' Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Barry Bonds was scratched from the San Francisco  
Giants' starting lineup today because of a sore left elbow, and 
will have an MRI performed on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a little tenderness and little soreness,'' Giants  
manager Dusty Baker said before a 12-3 loss to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The left fielder, who is tied for third in the NL lead with 12  
RBIs, was examined during the Giants' game against the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be checked again when the Giants return to San Francisco  
on Monday. Baker said Bonds' availability for Monday night's game 
against the Florida Marlins depends on the result of the MRI. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds, an eight-time All-Star with the Giants and Pittsburgh  
Pirates, is hitting .366 with four home runs. He was replaced in 
the lineup by Stan Javier, who went 1-for-4.

<HEADLINE> Sonia Gandhi Could Be New India PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- For years, Sonia Gandhi disdained  
politics and hid from public view. 
</P>
<P>
	When her mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated in 1984,  
she pleaded with her husband, Rajiv, against taking his mother's 
place as prime minister. When her husband was killed in 1991, she 
went into seclusion, shunning the politicians who begged her to 
lead them. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she reluctantly emerged from the shadows to accept the  
inheritance of India's foremost political dynasty a year ago, when 
the venerable Congress Party reached its lowest point. Now, the 
Italian-born widow may be India's next prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee lost a vote of  
confidence in parliament by one vote and resigned. His fall was 
precipitated by the defection of his biggest coalition ally. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congress Party, which the Gandhi family has dominated since  
Indira's father, Jawaharlal Nehru, led it in the 1930s, is likely 
to form the next government. If it cannot, an election will be held 
within months. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mrs. Gandhi did not initiate the government's downfall,  
she engineered the final blow. Indian newspapers said her personal 
lobbying on the telephone Friday night turned key votes against the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	For the enigmatic Mrs. Gandhi, it was a rare foray beyond her  
immediate circle. She is considered a strategist who lets her 
lieutenants carry out decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Still a political novice who has never held an elected office,  
she rarely speaks in public and does not hold news conferences or 
give lengthy interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi's campaigning before the 1998 elections was credited  
with rescuing the fast-declining, century-old party from oblivion. 
After the election, she agreed to become the party's president and 
focused on rebuilding it after years of scandal and ineffective 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she is an intensely private person, Indians have always  
been fascinated by Mrs. Gandhi. Her face is a favorite for magazine 
covers. Even during her years of silence, every private meeting, 
smile or nod was dissected by the Indian press, which speculated on 
who was in favor and who was out. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting dignitaries routinely called on her at her home, as if  
she were an elder statesman. 
</P>
<P>
	If she becomes prime minister, her Italian origin will come  
under greater scrutiny. During the three-day confidence debate, one 
speaker ignited a shoving match when he referred to Mrs. Gandhi as 
``a foreigner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anand Mohan, an opposition member who crossed sides to vote for  
the government, told reporters, ``A foreign national cannot be 
accepted as the prime minister. If I had to choose between Vajpayee 
and Sonia Gandhi, I would choose Vajpayee a thousand times.'' He 
noted that Mrs. Gandhi was married many years before adopting 
Indian citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	Although born a Roman Catholic, she shows public reverence for  
Hinduism, India's predominant religion. She wears saris and speaks 
a rough, accented Hindi. Her daughter Priyanka, 27, helps draft 
many of her speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, who is 51, met her husband when she was an  
18-year-old student at Cambridge in London, the first time she was 
away from her native Italy. During most of their courtship, she did 
not know he was the son of India's prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite doubts many have about a foreign-born leader, Mrs.  
Gandhi has won many hearts by embracing the essence of Indian 
lifestyle. For traditional Indians, that means becoming a loyal 
daughter-in-law and member of her husband's family. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was closer to Indira Gandhi than Sonia. When the prime  
minister was assassinated by her own bodyguards in 1984, it was 
Sonia who cradled the head of the dying woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother-in-law had been the center of our universe ... the  
pivot of our lives,'' Sonia Gandhi later wrote in a book. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the Congress Party turned to Rajiv, then a pilot for  
Indian Airlines, to take the leadership of the party, she begged 
him not to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pleaded with him, with others around him, too. He would be  
killed as well,'' she wrote in a book dedicated to her late 
husband. ``He held my hands, hugged me, tried to soothe my 
desperation. He had no choice, he said. He would be killed 
anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rajiv Gandhi served a full five-year term, but lost the 1989  
election when his name was linked to a payoff scandal in a huge 
arms deal. He was killed during a campaign appearance in south 
India by a woman who detonated explosives attached to her body.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Pick Davis Lookalike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos, whose sixth-round selection of  
an obscure running back from Georgia four years ago turned out to 
be a stroke of genius, have drafted another Georgia runner in a 
late round. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Broncos say they see the same qualities in Olandis Gary  
as they saw in Terrell Davis, whose 2,008-yard performance last 
season earned him the league's MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver opened the second day of the draft Sunday by taking Gary  
with the last selection in the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the two-day lottery, the Broncos made a total of 12 picks,  
increasing their cache by one after trading one of their 
fifth-round picks to Washington for sixth- and seventh-round 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the Broncos took Tennessee linebacker Al Wilson,  
Texas Tech defensive end Montae Reagor, Duke guard Lennie Friedman, 
Eastern Illinois cornerback Chris Watson and Florida wide receiver 
Travis McGriff. Gary headed the Sunday group. 
</P>
<P>
	For Denver, it was not a particularly sexy draft, and in the  
view of coach Mike Shanahan, gave the two-time Super Bowl champions 
just what they needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a good football team coming in,'' Shanahan said. ``We  
got a lot more depth, we got a lot more team speed. We'll be a lot 
more competitive in training camp because of the addition of these 
players. So it's a win-win situation for us. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, I feel like it was an excellent draft.''  
</P>
<P>
	So good, in fact, that for the first time in memory, the Broncos  
won't tender free-agent contracts to any undrafted prospects. They 
have filled all their needs and, in addition, will be near the 
salary cap limit because of the high number of draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Shanahan emphasized character.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm not mistaken, six or seven of our picks were captains  
of their team,'' he said. ``Quality character goes a long way. I 
think it's one of the reasons we've been able to win two Super 
Bowls back-to-back -- because of the character of our team, along 
with the talent, obviously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary had modest statistics at Georgia, just as Davis did.  
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-11, 216-pounder carried 143 times for 698 yards and  
10 touchdowns last fall, but he does more than just carry the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really liked him,'' Shanahan said. ``We thought he was a  
complete back, and we think he has a chance to come in and compete 
right away. We weren't looking for a running back, but he had some 
intangibles and played very much like Terrell did when he was in 
college, and that's why we went in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look for certain qualities in a running back -- a guy who  
can make people miss, can take some punishment, can catch the ball 
and block. We look at how he handles himself, how he plays the 
game. We were excited he was available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary, who spoke to the media on a conference call, said he drew  
inspiration from a recent Davis autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last season I was reading his book and I found out how he  
never gave up on his hopes and his dreams,'' Gary said. ``I think 
that really propelled me in the last half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time a guy can come out of a university without a big name  
and do the things he's done, it's terrific. He's someone for all of 
us to model ourselves on, especially guys who were not getting the 
playing time they felt they deserved.''

<HEADLINE> Eartha Kitt Visits Gov. Ventura </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Singer Eartha Kitt turned in a different  
kind of performance when she visited Gov. Jesse Ventura, doing a 
handstand on his desk while he touted the benefits of physical 
fitness. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is amazing,'' Ventura said after Ms. Kitt's stunt Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``At the age of 72,'' interjected the performer, who was in the  
Twin Cities over the weekend for shows at a nightclub and visited 
with Ventura, a former pro wrestler, for about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here to support his original ideas about supporting common  
sense,'' she said. ``He's fun because of both his sense of humor 
and practical common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kitt played Catwoman on the 1960s Batman TV show; Ventura  
had a small role in the more recent ``Batman and Robin'' movie. But 
the singer said the connection never came up.

<HEADLINE> Lindros Unlikely for Postseason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros rejoined his teammates today  
for the first time since a collapsed lung put him in the hospital 
more than two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, dressed in a dark blue suit, was still uncertain about  
whether he'll return to the Flyers for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling better every day, I'm getting stronger,'' Lindros  
told reporters during the first intermission of Philadelphia's 
regular-season finale Sunday against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it all depends on how far we go (in the postseason). I'm  
not going to pinpoint a time to return,'' Lindros said as he sat in 
front of two 8-foot tall sheets of cardboard filled with 
well-wishes from fans. ``I'm just going to go day-by-day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros looked pale and gaunt but spoke in his normal low tone  
of voice. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been sidelined since the team's April 1 game against  
Nashville after suffering a collapsed right lung. Doctors are still 
unsure what caused it to collapse, allowing about six pints of 
blood to seep into his chest cavity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers captain returned to Philadelphia on April 8, but was  
back in the hospital the next day and had surgery after doctors 
discovered more fluid in his chest cavity. 
</P>
<P>
	Since being released from the hospital last Tuesday, Lindros  
said his recovery has been slow but steady. Doctors have him on a 
high protein diet and Lindros has lost 12 pounds since the 
beginning of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros did skate for about 20 minutes Saturday at the team's  
practice facility as doctors monitored his heart rate, and he has 
begun riding an exercise bike. 
</P>
<P>
	He was on the ice before Sunday's game to receive the team's  
most valuable player award. He has 40 goals and a team-leading 93 
points over 71 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros got a 10-second ovation from the crowd after coming out,  
and he smiled and briefly waved back to the fans before returning 
to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	If he does return this season, Lindros said he will probably  
have to wear a protective vest. 
</P>
<P>
	The recovery process ``is not always fun, but that's the way it  
is and I have to get through this,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Penn FB Latest `Mr. Irrelevant' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- With the Chicago Bears picking last,  
Penn fullback Jim Finn made the perfect ``Mr. Irrelevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After all, how many other teams are coached by a fellow Ivy  
Leaguer? And what other team has a chairman emeritus who went to 
Penn? Heck, how many other teams even have a chairman emeritus? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to get the last pick in the draft, and get a guy  
from the Ivy League, and find him at the place to draft him,'' Mark 
Hatley, the Chicago Bears' vice president of player personnel, said 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the toughest thing for us to do in the draft, but  
it's sort of funny how things fall out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the last few years, the last pick in the draft has  
affectionately been dubbed, ``Mr. Irrelevant.'' And despite the 
name, it's not a bad gig. For being the last pick -- No. 253, for 
future trivia -- Finn gets a trip to Disneyland, a parade and a few 
other goodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to mention a shot at Chicago's roster.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm going to go to camp and prove I'm not `Mr.  
Irrelevant,''' Finn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last pick of the draft was supposed to go the expansion  
Cleveland Browns, but they traded it to the Bears. Chicago was 
looking for a fullback throughout the draft, and when the last pick 
rolled around, there was Finn. 
</P>
<P>
	Finn is fourth on Penn's career list with 2,277 yards rushing  
and fifth with 180 points scored. He's also been used as a 
third-down receiver, and at 255 pounds the Bears think he'll be a 
good blocker. 
</P>
<P>
	And with Finn's intangibles, the Bears just couldn't miss. Coach  
Dick Jauron is also an Ivy Leaguer, though he went to Yale. Ed 
McCaskey, the Bears' chairman emeritus, also went to Penn, Hatley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of those things that all fell in place,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dirty Look Gets Daughter Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENT, Wash. (AP) -- A man who shot his daughter seven times last  
year after she gave him a dirty look was convicted of first-degree 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	A King County Superior Court jury on Friday convicted Harminder  
Singh Virk, 54, of killing his 18-year-old daughter, Ranjit, on May 
13. 
</P>
<P>
	Virk faces a minimum of 25 years in prison when he is sentenced  
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	During his trial, Virk testified he became angry when he saw his  
daughter sleeping at the kitchen table instead of studying for her 
driver's license test. When he roused her, the woman looked at him 
and ``curled her lip,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Virk testified he retrieved a handgun in a rage, trying to scare  
his daughter. He said he began shooting after she once again made a 
face at him. 
</P>
<P>
	Virk shot her body five times, then reloaded to fire two shots  
into her head. He later turned himself in at a nearby police 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors portrayed Virk as devout Sikh who holds tightly to  
the traditions of his native India. They argued that he killed his 
daughter because she wanted to break from his strict rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Virk's attorneys said a severe depression left him too mentally  
impaired to consider his actions.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Raul Diaz Arce's goal in the fifth shootout  
round gave the San Jose Clash a 2-1 victory over D.C. United on 
Saturday night before the largest crowd to watch a regular-season 
MLS game at RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz Arce challenged United goalkeeper Tom Presthus straight on,  
sliding a low shot that snuck beneath his right arm for the 
decisive goal. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose also got goals during the shootout from Ronald  
Cerritos, Eddie Lewis and Jamie Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Etcheverry and Jaime Moreno scored in the first two rounds  
of the shootout for D.C. United, which lost its first in four 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The game drew 35,167, the largest crowd to see an MLS regular  
season game, surpassing the 35,032 that attended D.C. United's 
inaugural match in 1996. The only larger crowd in franchise history 
was the 57,431 that saw the United win the MLS Cup in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. United's Geoff Augner and Cerritos swapped goals in a  
seven-minute, first-half span for a 1-1 halftime tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The United went ahead 1-0 in the fourth minute when Augner  
converted a left-wing chip from Etcheverry. 
</P>
<P>
	Presthus gobbled up Diaz Arce's point-blank attempt about a  
minute later, but was helpless to stop Cerritos in the 11th minute. 
Cerritos leaped high to flick a header off a feed from Cloutier. 
</P>
<P>
	Augner was ejected in the 75th minute for undercutting San  
Jose's Jeff Baicher, and the United played a man down for the 
remainder of regulation.

<HEADLINE> Salvage Team Delays Capsule Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Hampered by a bad power switch  
aboard ship, an underwater salvage team on Sunday put off by one 
day its search for Gus Grissom's sunken space capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	The salvage experts will now set sail from Port Canaveral on  
Monday, after they have replaced a switch in a hydraulic power 
unit, said Karen Siebert, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Cosmosphere 
and Space Center. The cosmosphere will restore the 38-year-old 
Mercury capsule if it's recovered from the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Siebert said the expedition had to be delayed because there was  
nowhere to buy the needed part on a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of the expedition, Curt Newport, has teamed up with  
the Discovery Channel to find Liberty Bell 7, which sank following 
Grissom's successful 15-minute suborbital flight on July 21, 1961. 
The hatch blew open prematurely, and the capsule took on so much 
water it could not be lifted by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport believes the capsule is on the ocean floor 300 miles  
southeast of Cape Canaveral. He'll use the latest in side-scan 
sonar to try to find it.

<HEADLINE> Teacher of Year Uses Fun Lessons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Andrew Baumgartner, a kindergarten teacher  
from Georgia, comes up with just about anything to get the kids in 
his class to learn. He has served as host of a wedding for Sleeping 
Beauty, complete with limousine and cake, and a knighting ceremony 
for Jack after he killed the giant in the Beanstalk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes they may seem a bit off the wall,'' Baumgartner said  
of his ideas to bring the magic of reading to young minds, ``but 
nothing tried is nothing gained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That sense of adventure earned Baumgartner, 46, the honor of  
being named the 1999 national teacher of the year. He is the first 
Georgia winner of the national contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Classes should be an adventure every day,'' he said. ``They  
should be places where children discover ... where failure is kept 
at bay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner was teaching at A. Brian Merry Elementary School, in  
Augusta, Ga., when he went on leave last year to tour the state in 
honor of his selection as Georgia's teacher of the year for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the 530 students at the school get free lunch,  
educators' most common measure of student poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher for 23 years, Baumgartner has battled his share of  
educational demons, even in his own family. He went through the 
pain of watching his son, diagnosed with multiple learning 
disabilities, fail at and eventually drop out of school in 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is one of the students who fell between the cracks,'' he  
said in a recent interview. ``When a school fails a child, it fails 
an entire family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His son, 21, got his generally equivalency certificate and is  
enrolled in an Augusta technical school. The experience forced 
Baumgartner to re-evaluate his own teaching style. 
</P>
<P>
	``It turned me into the teacher who became the teacher of the  
year. I had to dig down deep and figure out who I was,'' 
Baumgartner said. 
</P>
<P>
	He started out as a kindergarten-through-12th grade speech  
pathologist, for which he studied at the University of Georgia in 
the mid-1970s. He decided to stick to one school. 
</P>
<P>
	So Baumgartner, a former Marine, went on to earn a master's  
degree in early childhood education from North Georgia College. He 
never thought the littlest children would be too tough to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a real thirst for learning,'' he said. ``They're  
still very eager to try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also has fought to overcome skepticism toward male teachers,  
especially ones in the early grades. More than three-fourths of the 
nation's teachers are women. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stereotype was they had to be motherly women, maternal,''  
he said. ``I had to show that I could be paternal, which is just as 
good or better since many of these kids don't have fathers at 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Little boys in school need to see men succeeding.''  
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner, who is from Savannah, Ga., was inspired to teach by  
his minister father. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were taught that we'd been so blessed by God that it was  
our duty to give something back. I did that by having a career in 
service,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He will spend a year on promotional tours as teacher of the  
year, kicked off with a ceremony Monday at the White House. The 
award is sponsored by the Council of Chief State School Officers 
and Scholastic Inc., the educational publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner wants to use his tenure to emphasize that teachers  
and principals should not be alone in setting high academic 
standards for school children 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one must be accountable for the public education  
system,'' he said. ``That's why it's called the public education 
system.''

<HEADLINE> Telecom Italia in Alliance Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA confirmed late today it is  
considering an industrial alliance with Deutsche Telekom AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia ``is examining with Deutsche Telekom a hypothesis  
of industrial alliance, the elements of which are still being 
evaluated,'' the former Italian state monopoly said in a 
much-awaited but terse statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the event that an accord is reached, it will have to be  
deliberated upon by the relevant statutory bodies,'' it added 
without elaborating further. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about a possible deal between the two  
telecommunications companies has been swirling after published 
reports last week. If a deal is reached, it could be the biggest 
merger in history, beating the pending $73.7 billion linkup between 
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	To pull off their merger, Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia  
would first have to win the approval of the Italian and German 
governments and the European Commission's antitrust department. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement Sunday was in apparent response to a request by  
Italian stock market regulator Consob, which asked Telecom to state 
whether it was in merger talks with the German company. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Sunday, Deutsche Telekom declined to comment on a report  
in German financial Handelsblatt that the two companies planned to 
fold their stock into a new telecommunications holding company on a 
60-40 percent basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would be worth nearly $200 billion.  
Deutsche Telekom has a market capitalization of about $117 billion, 
far bigger than Telecom Italia's $77 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian prime minister's office has said, however, that an  
eventual accord must be on an equal footing. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia, currently the target of a hostile takeover bid  
by Olivetti SpA, has been actively seeking alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti proposed in February to buy Telecom Italia for $58  
billion and later sweetened its bid to $65.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's tender offer prospectus is expected to be approved by  
Consob within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	According to press reports Sunday, Telecom Italia's board will  
meet on Monday.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO today launched its most active  
day of airstrikes in its assault on Yugoslavia, pummeling 
refineries, bridges and dozens of other targets in what it claimed 
were ``highly successful'' operations. But the refugee crisis 
deepened with ethnic Albanians streaming out of Kosovo at the rate 
of a thousand an hour. A car carrying a family across the border to 
Albania struck a land mine planted by Serb forces, killing five 
people.

ambassador for war crimes said today. David Scheffer also said 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``certainly (is) a prime 
target for investigation'' as a war criminal. Milosevic has been 
advised of that in a letter from prosecutor Louise Arbour of the 
U.N. war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands. Scheffer, appearing on 
Fox News, brought side-by-side NATO photographs of the town of 
Izbica that depicted an area taken at different times. In one

will be announced Tuesday on the steps of the Capitol building in 
Sacramento, Calif. The long-range electric vehicles will rely on 
low-grade gasoline instead of batteries. Fuel cells will produce 
electricity using a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen

50 percent of the vote counted, Ecevit's Democratic Left Party had 
23 percent of the vote. Virtue was taking only 16 percent of the

<HEADLINE> O's Ripken Sits Out With Back Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Cal Ripken missed his fourth game of the season  
on Sunday and will head to Cleveland to have his back examined by a 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very disappointing,'' he said before the Baltimore  
Orioles played the Toronto Blue Jays. ``I thought I had turned the 
corner. I felt very good coming in. I told the trainer that I 
thought it was behind me, that I had the capacity to work and do 
the things necessary to play, make strides and get better. But 
that's kind of changed right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, first baseman Will Clark fractured his left thumb on  
an infield grounder Sunday. He returned to Baltimore after the 
game, and it's not known how long he will be sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, 38, is hitting just .179 (5-for-28) with two RBIs and  
has made five errors -- three short of his 1998 total. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the April 5 season opener in the third inning because of  
back stiffness, then sat out on April 7-8, the first time he missed 
consecutive games since he was a 22-year-old rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	After he made a double error that led to five unearned runs by  
the New York Yankees on Thursday night, he said his back felt fine 
but manager Ray Miller gave him a day off Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken said he felt something in his back during Saturday's game  
but remained in. The pain was worse Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to rationalize it by saying it might be an aching pain  
from playing on turf,'' Ripken said. ``I said let's not evaluate it 
too critically now, let's wait till tomorrow morning and see what 
happens. Tomorrow morning came and I realized it was something more 
than just an aching pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Orioles traveled to Tampa after Sunday's game, Ripken  
went to Cleveland to see Dr. Henry Bohlman on Monday, when the team 
is off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not having any answers, and not having gone through too much  
of this kind of thing, I don't know what lies ahead,'' Ripken said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if it's something he could play with for the rest of  
season Ripken said: ``I'll have answers to those questions when I 
have answers for my back. All those things will be asked and 
discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, in his 18th major league season, set baseball's Ironman  
mark by playing in 2,632 consecutive games before sitting out 
Orioles' final home game last season. He broke the previous record 
of 2,130 set by Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to dealing with back pain, Ripken has said it's a  
mental challenge to push forward following the March 25 death of 
his father, Cal Ripken Sr., a former Orioles manager.

harsh treatment by their parents, including being deprived of food 
and water. 
</P>
<P>
	The children -- ages 4, 8, 11 and 17 -- were removed in late  
January from the family's home in suburban Harrison Township after 
the teen, Eddie Sizemore Jr., mailed a letter to his nearby aunt, 
pleading for help. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger children were found to speak to each other in a  
broken, guttural form of English. All are now in the care of 
another aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Their parents, Edward and Lucinda Sizemore, remain jailed after  
pleading innocent last week to four counts of non-support of a 
dependent, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published Sunday, Sizemore Jr. told the Dayton  
Daily News he was made to sleep on the living room floor in shorts 
under a sheet of plastic in the winter, and that his parents often 
barred him from drinking water and eating food. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager said their father would occasionally allow the  
children outside years ago but eventually stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say the children show no signs of physical abuse.  
</P>
<P>
	But ``there were certainly things happening that were abusive,''  
said Mary Anne Nelson, a case manager for Montgomery County 
Children's Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Malocu, an attorney representing Edward Sizemore Sr., said  
his client is a hardworking father who strove to support his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly had no intention to hurt or deprive them in any  
way,'' Malocu said.
