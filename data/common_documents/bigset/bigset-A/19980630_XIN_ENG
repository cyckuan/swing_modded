<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Party Threatens to Withdraw Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition party of
Nepal said Monday that if the present minority government does not
heed the national issues and its demands, it will have to withdraw
its support, which is crucial for the survival of the government.
</P>
<P>
Man Mohan Adhikari, chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxism-Leninism) (CPN-UML), made the threat at a press
conference following a similar one by his party on Sunday at the
opening session of parliament.
</P>
<P>
He alleged that the government under the slogan of seeking
national consensus has not done anything and has tried to suppress
the people.
</P>
<P>
He said India has encroached upon the Nepalese territory
including Pashupatinagar in eastern Nepal and Kalapani in the
far-western part of the country and has stationed its army in
Kalapani, but the government has not taken the issue seriously.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a review of the 1950 Peace and Friendship Treaty
between the two countries as raised by his party has not moved
forward, he said.
</P>
<P>
And the policies adopted by the government in the economic
sector made the economic situation worse, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
"If the government does not pay proper attention to the
national issues and our demands, we may be compelled to withdraw
our support," he warned.
</P>
<P>
After assuming power in mid-April, the government led by Girija
Prasad Koirala survived a vote of confidence with the support of
the CPN-UML, which however presented a 36-point demand as a
precondition.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of parliament on Sunday, the CPN-UML
indicated that it may withdraw its support if the government does
not heed the national problems.
</P>
<P>
At the session, other opposition parties also strongly
criticized the government over the issue of Kalapani and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
Koirala is to face a tough time as the summer session, also
known as the budget session, will discuss and pass the budget
presented by his government for the 1998/99 fiscal year which
begins in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
If he fails to muster 103 votes for the passage of the budget
in the 205-seat Lower House, where his Nepali Congress Party holds
only 88 seats, he has no other choice but to resign.

<HEADLINE> UN Drafts New Ethical Guidelines on HIV Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has drawn up new ethical guidelines on HIV
vaccine research, announced the UNAIDS here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new ethical guidelines will complement the current
International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving
Human Subjects, which were produced by the Council for
International Organizations of Medical Science (CIOMS) and the
World Health Organization (WHO) in 1993.
</P>
<P>
When the existing guidelines were drafted, the contributors did
not anticipate the special problems that would arise today with
the start of the first-ever Phase III trials of an HIV vaccine,
involving thousands of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
The UNAIDS said that the new guidelines, though not legally
binding, will pave the way for large-scale international trials of
HIV vaccines.
</P>
<P>
They have been developed by the UNAIDS as a result of a
nine-month consultative process involving 200 people from 30
countries.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines reinforce the need to obtain individual
informed consent, and deal with more difficult ethical issues
including the need to ensure an appropriate standard of
counselling and other HIV preventive measures, and to provide
treatment and care for people who become infected during the
course of the trial.
</P>
<P>
A key proposal is that once a vaccine is proved to be safe and
effective, the obligation to make the vaccine widely available
should be the joint responsibility of all the agencies involved in
sponsoring the trials, including the pharmaceutical manufacturers,
research agencies, national and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
One of the most difficult ethical issues to resolve was the
appropriate level of medical treatment that should be made
available to treat participants who become HIV-infected. The
consensus reached suggests that participating countries need to
consider the highest attainable standards of care within the
context of their own realities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 12th World AIDS Conference, currently being
held in Geneva, UNAIDS Executive Director Peter Piot pointed out
that with 16,000 new infections now occurring every day, the
development of an HIV vaccine was a major priority for the world
community.
</P>
<P>
Those taking part in the trials should be among the first to
benefit from the availability of a vaccine, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
"Those taking the risks of HIV vaccine development should be
the first to realize the benefit," he said. "So all populations
worldwide who have participated in vaccine research should have
some form of early and preferential access."
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, he said, were intended to ensure that ethical
considerations were given due consideration in the development of
a new vaccine. They heralded a new era of cooperation and
capacity-building between countries.
</P>
<P>
"Paternalism and resource imbalance should be replaced by
empowerment in decision-making and equality in partnership between
sponsors and hosts of scientific research," he said.

<HEADLINE> Water Pollution in China Serious, Top Legislator Says (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Analyzing the causes of water shortages, Zou said that
pollution has greatly reduced the use of water resources, damaged
the environment affecting water, lowered the effective supply of
water resources, and threatened people's safe drinking water
supply.
</P>
<P>
Zou said water pollution in China is so serious that the speed
of treatment can't keep up with the increase in pollution. Water
pollution is expanding from the urban areas to rural areas and
from parts of a river to the whole basin, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the country's rivers and lakes and coastal seas are
polluted to differing degrees, and the quality of the water
environment is continuing to be degraded, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, water quality of major rivers declined in all the
basins of the country, and the pollution of rivers in the north
part of China has become more critical than that in the south,
according to a study by the research center under the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that water pollution worsened last year in the
coastal areas and in the river sections that pass through
cities. Some 80 percent of the water of the Yellow River, China's
second largest river, is polluted, it states.
</P>
<P>
Qu Geping, chairman of the NPC Environmental and Resources
Protection Committee, also spoke at the meeting, saying that the
water pollution law has played an active role in increased
treatment and in improving the water environment.
</P>
<P>
But, Qu said, it should be noted that the water environment is
not good, with the total drainage of wastewater going up and the
polluted areas expanding.
</P>
<P>
The domestic sewage in urban areas has doubled compared with
1990, increasing by up to 19 billion tons yearly, with an annual
increase of 12.7 percent, Qu said.
</P>
<P>
However, the rate of sewage treatment is only about 13.6
percent, that is, some 16 billion tons of sewage was directly
poured into rivers and lakes, Qu said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Chinese Cities Among World's Five Costliest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese cities, Hong Kong,
Beijing and Shanghai have been rated among the five most expensive
cities in the world in the spring of 1998, with Tokyo, Japan, and
Moscow, Russia, coming second and the fourth respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The trend during the past 12 months indicates that Chinese
cities are tending to become more expensive despite inflation
rates approaching zero percent," said the Geneva-based Corporate
Resources Group (CRG). The Group published its spring 1998 edition
of the Worldwide Cost of Living Rankings here Monday.
</P>
<P>
China's Guangzhou (seventh) and Dalian (ninth) are among the
top ten and Shenzhen is 11th.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CRG said, Japanese cities are becoming less
expensive as the yen weakens. Tokyo has fallen from first place in
the previous year to second. Osaka (sixth) is the only Japanese
city in the top ten besides Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
South East Asian cities have dropped dramatically as the
financial crisis in the region takes its toll. Seoul, South Korea,
fell from seventh in 1997 to the 46th in 1998 and Singapore fell
from the eighth to the 13th.
</P>
<P>
Swiss cities Geneva and Zurich, not so long ago among the top
five cities, continue to fall in the world rankings. Geneva and
Zurich are now ranked 17th and 18th in the world, nearly on the
same level as New York (21st).
</P>
<P>
With New York as the base of 100 index points, Hong Kong, the
world's most expensive city with an index of 157.4, is 266 percent
more expensive than Harare (150th), the capital of Zimbabwe, and
now the world's least expensive city with an index of 43.0.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the most expensive and the least expensive
cities has widened slightly to 114 index points compared to 110
points one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Affecting the ranking in the cost of living are more than 200
issues involving costs in ten categories including food at home,
alcohol and tobacco, domestic spending, personal care, clothes and
footwear, home services, utilities like energy costs and telephone
charges, entertainment, transport, and sports and leisure.
</P>
<P>
Moscow remains Europe's most expensive city. New York is the
most expensive city in North America. Sao Paulo, Brazil, is the
most expensive city in South America. Luanda, the capital of
Angola is the most expensive city in Africa. Tel Aviv, Israel,
remains the most expensive city in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The top ten cities with their index points are Hong Kong
(157.40), Tokyo (154.30), Beijing (153.10), Moscow (151.30),
Shanghai (144.90), Osaka (140.90), Guangzhou (122.80),
St. Petersburg (115.10), Dalian (112.90) and London (111.60).

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Sales Go Up to Record High in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nationwide sales of
new homes rose 0.3 percent to a record in May, the Commerce
Department reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sales reached a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 890,000 last
month, the highest since the government began tracking them in
1963, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
May is also the ninth consecutive month of sales at or above
800,000, the longest such streak in 21 years. For the first five
months of the year, sales were 8.8 percent higher than the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Home sales which include both new and existing, have been
exceptionally strong this year, largely attributed to the lowest
unemployment rates and close to the lowest mortgage interest rates
in nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales were strongest in the West in May, jumping
15.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 265,000, the
most since September 1979. They climbed 3.3 percent in the
Northeast to a rate of 94,000, highest in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the strong sales helped hold down the inventory of
unsold homes. They totaled 289,000, a 3.9-month supply at the
current sales pace, the same as the month before.
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home was 149,900 dollars in May, up
6.3 percent from a year ago.

MOSCOW, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
signed a decree Monday to remove administrative hurdles to
enterprises, saying development of enterprises is important for

</P>
<P>
State bodies' licensing businesses, as well as separating

Draft proposals should be worked out within a month by the
government on eliminating administrative barriers, and the
government should send to the Duma, the lower house of parliament,
a bill on lowering deductions imposed on small businesses for the
Russian Pension Fund.
</P>
<P>
The decree also ordered leasing of state property by federal
and regional governments, on a competitive basis, to small
businesses and entrepreneurs whose own output makes up 75 percent
of goods and services they sell.

MONTPELLIER, France, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A late winner from Oliver
Bierhoff lifted Germany to a 2-1 win over Mexico in the second round
of the soccer World Cup here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The header, which came in the 85th minute on a pass from
second-half substitute Ulf Kirsten, sent the European champions to the
quarterfinals, where they will meet the winners of Tuesday's match
between Romania and Croatia.

<P>
Luis Hernandez put Mexico 1-0 ahead by slotting the ball home past
German keeper Andreas Kopke only two minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
German veteran Lothar Matthaus almost scored a own goal when he
sent the ball against the left-hand post in the 61st minute in an
attempt to clear a loose ball.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's Cuauhtemoc Blanco and Hernandez tried to pounce on but
Kopke made two successive saves.
</P>
<P>
The Germans stepped up attacks and equalized in the 74th minute
through captain Jurgen Klinsmann, who scored from within the penalty
area.
</P>
<P>
In the goalless first half, Tottenham Hotspur striker Klinsmann had
an early chance in the 28th minute when his header was saved by
Mexican keeper Jorge Campos.
</P>
<P>
Bierhoff, who plays for Italian side Udinese, had two opportunities
within a span of two minutes, shotting a long-range ball into the arms
of Campos in the 38th minute and head another onto the crossbar one

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, India to Enhance Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India decided on
Monday to strengthen cooperation in all fields, particularly in
the field of economy.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here with his Bangladeshi counterpart Mustafizur
Rahman, visiting Indian Foreign Office Secretary K. Raghunath said
India would reduce tariff on goods from Bangladesh to help
Bangladeshi products enter the Indian market.
</P>
<P>
Raghunath arrived here Sunday on a two-day visit to Bangladesh
following a visit to India by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Describing the visit as a "short follow-up" of the New Delhi
meeting between the prime ministers of the two countries,
Raghunath said on Sunday that his visit gave "an opportunity to
review...and update the existing excellent relationship between
the two countries."
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting between the foreign secretaries of
the two countries after India's Baratiya Janata Party came to
power earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Protestant Marchers Barred from Catholic Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's independent
Parades Commission on Monday barred Protestant marchers through a
nationalist area of Northern Ireland to avert potential clashes.
</P>
<P>
Commission chairman Alistair Graham said Orange Order marchers
would not be allowed down Garvaghy Road in Drumcree on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference the threat to public order could not
be overlooked in light of the failure to negotiate a compromise
route that would have avoided the Catholic Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
"Given the absence of any positive move towards accommodation
we cannot see at this stage how a parade could proceed again this
year down the Garvaghy Road without having a serious adverse
impact on community relationships both locally and more widely
across Northern Ireland."
</P>
<P>
But Orangemen in Portadown, 45 km southwest of Belfast, said
they would still march down the Road -- and were considering an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
The parade by the Orange Order, viewed by Northern Ireland's
Catholic minority as a threatening expression of Protestant
triumphalism, touched off rioting across the province in 1996 and
1997.
</P>
<P>
The Orange Order, an ancient Protestant brotherhood, regards
the marching route down the Garvaghy Road as a traditional right
that it is especially determined to uphold at a time of rapid
political change in Northern Ireland, where elections have just
been held for a power-sharing assembly.
</P>
<P>
Northern Irish Catholics, by contrast, regard the parade as a
crude provocation by the Protestant majority.
</P>
<P>
Britain has already sent 1,000 extra troops to Northern Ireland
in anticipation of possible trouble during the summer marching
season, regardless of the Commission's ruling.

<HEADLINE> Botswana to Retain Rand Peg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Botswana's central bank said
Monday there are no plans to scrap the de facto pegging of the
Pula to the South African Rand despite the severe impact of the
tumbling Rand to the Botswanan economy.
</P>
<P>
The falling South African currency has pulled the Pula down
almost 16 percent against the U.S. Dollar and Pound Sterling over
12 months. Pula stood at 0.2349 U.S. Dollars or 0.1410 Pounds
Sterling last Friday, compared to 0.2783 U.S. Dollars and 0.1673
Pounds a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot say how far we will go. When the Rand is under
great pressure, we watch the situation carefully," Governor
Baledzi Gaolathe was quoted by South African Press Association as
saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Pula is believed to be pegged to a basket of six
currencies. The central bank would not give details of the
basket's makeup, but market sources say that the Rand comprises
60 percent of the basket's weight.
</P>
<P>
This is to protect Botswana's fledgling manufacturing
industries, which are central to the diversification of the
economy from its dependence on diamond revenues. Eighty percent
of Botswana's non-diamond exports go to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
There has been an apparent lessening of the weight of the Rand
in the basket over the 12 months. The Pula has shown an
appreciation of 7.4 percent from 1.2586 Rand in June 1997 to
1.3522 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Botswana stockbrokers have voiced their fears that the falling
Pula will adversely affect the fortunes of the Botswana Stock
Exchange, which has so far avoided the storm blowing over the
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
"There could be increased off-loading of stocks...I think we
are starting to see that already," Chief Executive of
Stockbrokers Botswana said.
</P>
<P>
Some said that the market is getting close to the point where
investors would forget the underlying strength of Botswana's
economy and see only a weakening currency, triggering massive
capital outflow.
</P>
<P>
Botswana has the world's fastest growing economy in the past
three decades, a World Bank report said earlier this year. The
country's growth rates in recent years were above six percent,
much better than the southern African and continental average.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chirac's Quiet But Important Visit to S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- In contrast to U.S.
President Bill Clinton's lavish show in South Africa three months
ago, French President Jacques Chirac's visit to the country
seemed to be quiet.
</P>
<P>
But the three-day state visit which ended Sunday is no less
important than Clinton's, observers believe.
</P>
<P>
It is well known that Chirac's visit is aimed at spreading his
country's economic and political influence southward from the
Francophone Africa.
</P>
<P>
France, like other big powers, considers South Africa as its
best new partner in Africa. South Africa, which produces about
30 percent of Africa's wealth, is rising as the leader in the
emerging markets in the continent.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is France's largest trading partner in the
sub-Saharan Africa and their bilateral trade has doubled since
1994, with the balance much in France's favor.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade between France and South Africa amounted
to about 6.6 billion Rand (about 1.3 billion U.S. Dollars) in
1997, a 20.5 percent increase from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The new French companies in South Africa have trebled in
number over the past four years and there are now about 130
established French companies in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, France is now only South Africa's 11th biggest
trading partner, lagging behind South Africa's three main trading
partners, Britain, Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Franco-South African Economic Forum on Friday,
Chirac lamented his country's weak image in the southern Africa
and called for efforts to promote the economic cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that France is ready to play a bigger role in South
Africa's economy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the trade between South Africa and the rest of the
continent has doubled since 1994, Chirac said fears that France
and South Africa would become rivals are not founded.
</P>
<P>
The French president said that the two countries, instead of
competing, complement each other in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Firstly, because South Africa's areas of excellence in Africa
differ significantly from ours; secondly, because our
geographical focus differs, France's position is especially in
north and west Africa. South Africa continues to focus primarily
on southern Africa, which accounts for two-thirds of its African
exports, and to a lesser extent, on the east Africa."
</P>
<P>
South Africa, on the other hand, is no less enthusiastic about
forging closer ties with France.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's ambition to play a crucial role in Africa and
to be a major player in the international community could not be
achieved without the support of France, which is a permanent
member of the United Nations Security Council and a leading
member of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said Friday that Chirac's visit was of great importance
to South Africa. "It is quite clear that, as we try to improve
ourselves as a country and try to play a new role in the world,
we will need the friendship and support of France."
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Chirac promised South Africa with new
investments, a free trade agreement between South Africa and the
European Union before the end of the year and France's support
for South Africa's bid for a permanent seat in the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
As another gesture which will certainly win support from
African countries, Chirac made it clear that his country favors
debt relief for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
His stand was in sharp contrast to Washington's new
trade-for-aid Africa policy.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Legislature Approves 1998 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) approved Monday the 1998 budget of about 1.8 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 88-member PLC passed the budget in a special session held
in the West Bank city Ramallah, the East Jerusalem-based
Palestinian news service the Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center (JMCC) reported.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 37-22 with six abstentions, and 23 PLC
members did not attend the session.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 budget totaled 1.85 billion dollars with a deficit of
36.9 million dollars. Of the budget, about 900 million dollars are
foreign aid that will be allocated for development projects, the
JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Some amendments have been made to the original budget plan
presented by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Early this month, some PLC members cited the unreasonable
budget allocations as one of the reasons for threatening to file a
no-confidence motion against the PNA.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
left for Angola Monday afternoon, ending his 24-hour state visit
to Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
During his first visit to Mozambique, Chirac and Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano signed four cooperative agreements
worth 10 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, France will provide assistance to
Mozambique in the fields of water conservancy, culture,
judiciary, agriculture and fishery.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference jointly held with Chissano, President
Chirac said that France may strengthen its presence in
Mozambique, but not at the expense of others' interests.
</P>
<P>
The French president said that France will respect the
historical relations between Mozambique and its traditional
partners.
</P>
<P>
Chissano expressed his wish that the cooperation between his
country and France be strengthened, saying that French investment
in eight projects in the southern African country from 1985 to
1997 was only 72 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chirac had visited Namibia and South Africa before coming to
Mozambique.

BUCHAREST, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Romania's President Emil
Constantinescu left on Monday for Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, the
first leg of his one-week official visits to three Caucasus
countries, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
The issue of oil in the Caspian Sea is believed to be one of
the high points on the agenda of talks between Constantinescu and
the leaders of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Before departure, Constantinescu underlined that the state
visits he would pay to the three countries showed the special
importance Romania attaches to regional cooperation "in this
important zone between the Black and the Caspian Seas."
</P>
<P>
Romania's President Constantinescu will also visit the seaports
of Poti and Batumi, and the Supsa Black Sea terminal in Georgia,
possible transfer point of the Caspian oil to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Romania wants to have the oil pipes from the Caspian Sea cross
Romania in order to reach Western Europe.

<HEADLINE> UK Bankruptcies Up As Jobs Dwindle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of business failures in
Britain jumped by nearly 10 percent in the second quarter of the
year, providing firm evidence that the manufacturing sector is
heading for recession.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 businesses failed in April-June, 4 percent
higher than a year earlier, according to a quarterly survey
conducted by Dun &AMP; Bradstreet published Monday.
</P>
<P>
It also warned that the number of business failures in five
figures was the first time in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
"There are worrying signs in these latest figures which will
need to be checked during the rest of the year," said Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet senior analyst Philip Mellor.
</P>
<P>
Separate employment statistics, also published Monday, showed
that pressures on the labor market may be beginning to ease.
</P>
<P>
The Manpower third-quarter survey of employment prospects
revealed that there was no acceleration in labor market growth
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Manpower research, which surveyed 2,221 employers, said
that 28 percent of employers predict an increase in job levels for
the three months from July to September, but 8 percent reckon
there will be a decline.
</P>
<P>
The balance of 20 percent is equal to the figure for the third
quarter last year. It is the first time since 1996 that a
quarter's result has shown no improvement over the year before.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts here believe that the two sets of data are
likely to add to pressure on the Bank of England not to make a
further rate rise when it meets early next month.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Vice Minister
of Health Monday urged the people in the country to pay due
attention to the problem of blindness.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting here, Vice Minister Lamisso Hayesso said
that nearly 900,000 people in Ethiopia suffer from blindness
mainly caused by trachoma and cataract.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister said that about 90 percent of blindness in
Ethiopia is preventable.
</P>
<P>
The number of blind people worldwide is estimated to be about
45 million, Lamisso said, adding that the prevalence of blindness
is 10 to 20 times greater in the developing countries compared
with that in the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Regional Representative of
Christoffel Blinden Mission in Ethiopia M. Spath said that
Ethiopia has been selected as one of the 16 priority countries
worldwide where national trachoma control programs would be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
He added that 50 to 75 percent of blind people in Ethiopia
could be cured with the availability of the necessary facilities
for eye care, trained personnel and a concept for primary eye
care programs.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry of health, a blindness prevention
team has been established under the ministry to implement the
trachoma control program in the country.

<HEADLINE> Russian Ambassador to Belarus Leaves Drozdy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Ambassador to Belarus
Valery Loshchinin has left his residence in the Drozdy complex
outside Minsk, capital of Belarus, to a city apartment, Russian
Foreign Ministry's spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador sealed his residence in the Drozdy complex
because electricity and water there had been cut off, the Interfax
news agency quoted Rakhmanin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Loshchinin reminded the Minsk's side of that his residence in
Drozdy by an agreement between Russia and Belarus is Russia's
property.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that Moscow has no plan to recall its
ambassador from Minsk.
</P>
<P>
In later April, the Belarussian authorities notified more than
20 ambassadors who lived in the Drozdy residences to move out of
there to allow a renovation work.
</P>
<P>
These ambassadors accused Minsk of violating the Vienna
Convention on diplomatic rights and ambassadors from Britain,
France, Germany, Greece, Italy and the United States and other
states have left the Drozdy residences.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Rakhmanin at a briefing described the Belarussian
authorities' move as "an undiplomatic act", and on behalf of the
Russian side expressed regret about the conflict over the Drozdy
complex and about the departure of individual ambassadors from
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The Russian spokesman said the Russian side had done everything
it could to prevent the aggravation of this conflict and to settle
it through talks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the problem will be solved with due
account taken of the interests of all sides.

CAIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The European Union (EU) will provide 1 billion U.S.
dollars to help upgrade the Egyptian industry before it faces
European competition, the Middle East News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to promote the Egyptian industry through
various ways, including conducting research and training workers,
during the first three years of the application of the Egyptian-EU
partnership agreement due to be sealed this summer.
</P>
<P>
Egypt seeks to double its exports to Europe after the signing
of the agreement which will allow Egypt to sell agro-industrial
commodities to EU markets.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's economy is facing a difficult situation due to
the decline of oil prices in the world markets, the Egyptian
Al-Alam Al-Yom daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt lost 1 billion Egyptian pounds (294 million dollars) in
oil revenues from January to March this year compared with the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian oil prices went down remarkably during the last
months, bringing down the oil revenues to less than 1.99 billion
pounds (585 million dollars) compared with 2.17 billion pounds
(638 million dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>

TEHRAN -- Iran announced on Monday that it has finished
building the fourth oil platform to be installed in the Sirri
offshore oil field in the Gulf.

According to the monthly economic review report issued by the
Bank of Tanzania made available Monday, the overall inflation
rate which started to decline last September, continued to fall
last month.
</P>
<P>
The report said the inflation rate on underlying basis --
excluding food prices, dropped from 7.1 percent in April to 6.6
percent in May. This was mainly due to the low increase of costs
of key non-food items, such as fuel, power, water and
transportation, as well as rents.
</P>
<P>
The trend of decline in inflation is expected to continue in
the months ahead due to increased food supplies and continuation
of tight fiscal and monetary policies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Government revenue collection in May stood at 49.9 billion
Shillings (about 75 million U.S. Dollars) against the targeted
52.6 billion Shillings. The collection in May was 1.6 billion
Shillings less than the amount of the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the government spent 70.5 billion Shillings, a
91.2 percent of the monthly estimated expenditure. However, the
May expenditure hit the highest level since last July, the
beginning of the 1997/98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of May, grain procurement remained at 40,000 tons,
a 70.2 percent of the targeted 57,000 tons for this season.
</P>
<P>
The report forecast enough food production for this season.
The production is estimated at 7.8 million tons, up 34.5 percent
over the output of last season.
</P>
<P>
Production of cereals is expected to increase from three
million tons in 1996/97 fiscal year to about 4.5 million tons in
1997/98. Meanwhile, non-cereals are expected to increase from 2.8
million tons last year to 3.3 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings declined to 44.1 million U.S. Dollars last
month, compared to 44.5 million U.S. Dollars in April, while
imports bill increased to 128.5 million U.S. Dollars last month
from 119.5 million U.S. Dollars in the previous month.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Boost Labor Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran Monday opened four fairs to
introduce its technical, engineering and export services with an
aim to boost labor exports, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Commerce Minister and head of the Export
Promotion Center Mojtaba Khosrowtaj told the fairs' inaugural
ceremony that the specialized fairs would help increase the
exports of Iranian work force to foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Iran earned more than 906
million U.S. dollars over the past three years from export of
technical and engineering services.
</P>
<P>
Khosrowtaj said the figure would rise to 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars if the revenues made by Iranian companies abroad are
taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
Iran's public and private sectors are implementing 53
development and economic projects in foreign countries, according
to the official.
</P>
<P>
Some 220 private and public engineering, technical, service and
manufacturing companies attended the five-day fairs, the news

<P>
On the sidelines of the fairs, five seminars are to be held to
study the role of insurance and export guarantee fund in boosting
export of non-oil commodities and introduce the activities of the
Central Bank of Iran and Export Promotion Bank of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The seminars are also to focus on new programs adopted by
Iran's Customs Office to ease customs procedures for non-oil
exports and the importance of free trade zone and tourism in
raising exports.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Arrives in Angola for First State Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
arrived here Monday, starting his 48-hour visit to Angola at the
invitation of Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit of a French president to the southern
African country and it is the last leg of Chirac's trip to the
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the trip is to strengthen the economic
cooperation between the two nations
</P>
<P>
In a signed article contributed by the French president in the
daily O Jornal de Angola published Monday, Chirac said that
development cannot be achieved without stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The French president believed that Angolan peace is relevant
to the stability in the region and there would be no stability
unless peace is achieved in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The full implementation of the Lusaka Peace Protocol reached
in 1994 by the two warring sides is the sole guarantee for
Angolan peace, said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The French president said he is sure that the Lusaka peace
accord will be fully implemented and final peace will be
eventually achieved in Angola.
</P>
<P>
During the 48-hour visit, Chirac will hold talks with the
Angolan leaders and meet business leaders broadly, exchanging
views on cooperation between the two countries. And the two
countries will sign a couple of cooperative agreements.
</P>
<P>
Chirac came to Angola after visiting Namibia, South Africa and
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
France is one of the first countries who recognized the
independence of Angola. The two countries maintain close
cooperative relations in such fields as industry, agriculture,
health, fishery, petroleum, education and culture.
</P>
<P>
Both France and Angola hope to beef up the bilateral
cooperation and broaden the fields of the cooperation.

<P>
MONTPELLIER, France, June 29 (Xinhua) -- German coach Berti Vogts
was unhappy with the performance of defender Jurgen Kohler in their
2-1 win over Mexico in the World Cup second round.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to congratulate my team because it wasn't easy but my
players knew how to fight back. Jurgen Kohler's play wasn't up to the
standard of the rest of the defence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "I myself have played and trained in Mexico. I must
congratulate them, because I've never seen them play as well as they
did today."
</P>
<P>
But he said although he admitted Mexico's Jorge Campos was a great
goalkeeper, he did not think Campos could have stopped the two German
goals.
</P>
<P>
Germany had to rally from one goal down in the second half to beat
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go through this kind of situation again," he said.

He said, "We're leaving this World Cup with our heads high. We were
very ambitious here, but Germany pulled the rug out from under us."

PARIS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian forward Alessandro del Piero
said their match against host team France would be tough.
</P>
<P>
Italy will have to take on France in a quarter-final match on
Friday at Saint-Denis.
</P>
<P>
"The match will be difficult because they're playing at home.
Moreover, they are a very good team, strong in midfield and have
excellent teamwork." said Piero.
</P>
<P>
"I thought that Paraguay would be the surprise winners, but
France-Italy match will be a very interesting one," said Piero.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay held France to a goalless draw after 90 minutes of
regulation time and were only beaten at the 114 minutes by a
golden goal.
</P>
<P>
"I'm in great physical condition and even if I get kicked a
couple of times before the match I'm not going to complain," said
Piero, "I'm used to it, I'm an attacker."
</P>
<P>
Piero said:"Zinedine Zidane is the guiding light of the France
team, just as I am for Italy. But no one can tell me that is Del
Piero's World Cup."
</P>
<P>
"If our coach places his trust in me, then I will play to the
best of my abilities. Don't take me for the saviour of my country."

<HEADLINE> Romania, Croatia Similar in Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BORDEAUX, France, June 29 (Xinhua) -- When Romania play in Stade
Lescure here on Tuesday, they will find they are sharing many
characteristics with World Cup debutants Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Both teams are brimmed with creative players and possess techinical
prowess.
</P>
<P>
They also have strong midfields, with Gheorghe Hagi being the
playmaker for the Romanians and Zvonimir Boban on the Croatian side.
</P>
<P>
Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu said it was hard to make a
prediction of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
"The chances are 50-50. No one's the favorite," he said. "Croatia
have a game very similiar to our own."
</P>
<P>
The Romanians, who dyed their hair gold after a bet with
Iordanescu, rested five key players in its 1-1 draw with Tunisia after
they had qualified.
</P>
<P>
The unified hair color signifies the much cherished team spirit,
which striker Viorel Moldovan said would be the best weapon.
</P>
<P>
"Our own best asset is the team spirit which has already helped
against England," said Moldovan, who plays for Coventry City in
England.
</P>
<P>
"In the match against Croatia, I believe both teams have the same
chances. We know all our opponents. All of them play in European
championships and are very skilled," he said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Romania will depend much on Moldovan and his striking partner
Adrian Ilie from Valencia in the front.
</P>
<P>
Besides Hagi, Dorinel Munteanu is also effective in organizing
attacks by sending diagonal passes.
</P>
<P>
Defenders Gica Popescu and Dan Petrescu are dangerous when they
surge ahead to aid the attacks.
</P>
<P>
On the Croatian side, their biggest setback was the missing of
Zvonimir Soldo, who was banned after collecting two yellow cards in
the group competition.
</P>
<P>
But Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic was confident with lessons
gained from the match against Argentina.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident about this round of sixteen match. We controlled
(Gabriel) Batistuta and (Ariel) Ortega during the match against
Argentina on Friday. I think we will manage to block the Romanians
Popescu and Moldovan in the same way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blazevic added, "Mentally all of the players have a total will to
win and it's in that state of mind that will must go onto the pitch if
we want to win."
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem of Croatia is the age of its key players as
Boban, striker Davor Suker and midfielder Robert Prosinecki are all
veterans.

UNITED NATIONS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) will fund a project to help India
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it was announced here on Monday.
</P>

The program valued at 10.3 million U.S. dollars will demonstrate
the commercial feasibility of recovering and utilizing coal-bed
methane gas during and after the extraction of coal, UNDP said in
press release.
</P>
<P>
The recovered methane, a clean and renewable energy source, is
expected to fuel internal combustion generators powered by
converted bi-fuel engines.
</P>
<P>
Use of coal-bed methane gas has special significance for India,
as coal supplies 60-65 percent of its commercial energy needs.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Gulf Arab States' Readiness to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran Monday expressed welcome to
the readiness of Gulf Arab states to expand relations with Tehran,
but reiterating its sovereignty over three disputed Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a communique of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC), Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said
that Iran's firm principle is to strengthen and expand ties with
neighboring Muslim countries, Gulf Arab states in particular.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of GCC members said in the communique
issued at the end of their 67th meeting Sunday in Saudi Arabia
that GCC states are willing to promote ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
GCC, a regional political and economic alliance, groups six
Arab countries of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that developing and deepening cooperation among
regional countries would be the only way to maintain stability and
security in the strategic Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Iran believes that mutual understanding, dialog, promotion of
cooperation would help develop and promote relations, remove
misunderstandings and strengthen mutual trust among the regional
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mohammadi stressed that the islands of Abu Musa, the
Greater and Less Tunbs in the Gulf are "inseparable parts of Iran."
</P>
<P>
The only way to solve the problem between Iran and the UAE is
mutual understanding and bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
The GCC countries have expressed hope that the talks between
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and UAE officials in Abu
Dhabi last month would lead to a "favorable response from Tehran
to Abu Dhabi's initiatives aimed at a peaceful solution to their
territorial disputes."
</P>
<P>
After the British forces withdrew from the region in 1971,
Iran took over the three islands at the mouth of the strategic
Hormuz Strait. But the UAE also claimed sovereignty over the
islands.
</P>
<P>
During Kharrazi's visit, the two countries agreed to solve
their disputes through peaceful means.

UNITED NATIONS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) Administrator James Gustave Speth has called the
drop in development aid by developed nations as a tragedy, a UNDP
publication reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Western societies will pay dearly for their present-day neglect
of the problems of the developing world, the weekly UNDP Flash

</P>
<P>
Against the background of international aid falling for the
fifth straight year in 1997, Speth said it is a tragedy that aid
spending is plunging just when it is needed the most.
</P>
<P>
The aid decrease will cost the world more later in terms of
humanitarian assistance, peace-keeping and fight against diseases,
drugs and terrorism, Speth warned.

<P>
LAGOS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan will arrive in Nigeria later Monday for a four-day
official visit, according to the foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement Monday in the capital Abuja
that during the visit, Annan would meet with the head of state,
General Abdulsalam Abubakar, to discuss issues of common interest
to the U.N. and Nigeria, including the maintenance of
sub-regional peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"The government and people of Nigeria look forward to the
visit of the secretary-general and to its successful outcome," it
added.
</P>
<P>
Annan's visit to Nigeria is one in a series done by
high-ranking figures recently as part of the efforts by the West
to restore democracy in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd paid a visit to
Nigeria last week on behalf of the European Union. The
secretary-general of the Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, who
is from Nigeria, is in the country.
</P>
<P>
These visits are also expected to help break the diplomatic
isolation Nigeria has been faced with since 1993 when the Western
world imposed sanctions on the country.
</P>
<P>
The West has seen the sudden death of Nigeria's former
military leader General Sani Abacha as an opportunity to improve
relations with the most populous black African country.
</P>
<P>
Western countries hope Abacha's successor, General Abubakar
would handle the military government's transition to civil rule
program in a way that would bring democracy to the country.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Condemns Netanyahu's Call for Madrid II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad
Anani denounced Monday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
call for convening a second international meeting to discuss the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, Anani said Jordan rejects the
convening of such a meeting because Netanyahu is trying to evade
Israel's commitments to the Oslo accords that it signed with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Netanyahu's idea of reviving the multilateral
negotiations within a new framework will not be accepted by most
of the Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Jordan thinks that what Netanyahu should do at the present
time is to carry out his pledges made under the signed peace
accords and restart negotiations with the concerned parties, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in addition to the Oslo accords and the 1997
Hebron agreement, there also some existing resolutions adopted by
the United Nations Security Council concerning the Israeli-Arab
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"If Netanyahu wants peace, then the solutions are there.
The only thing he has to do is to agree on them," said
Anani.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Netanyahu proposed to convene an international
conference following the example of the 1991 Madrid conference to
discuss the peace process as well as regional issues in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
But his proposal sparked widespread condemnation from the
Palestinians, Arabs and other countries, which denounced it as an
attempt to escape from fulfilling Israeli commitments.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 Madrid conference, which brought the Israelis and
Arabs to face-to-face talks for the first time, set the framework
for the subsequent peace talks between Israel and its Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Little progress has been achieved in the Mideast peace process
since mid-1996 when the Netanyahu-led rightwing government came to
power.
</P>
<P>
Israel's talks with Syria and Lebanon have not resumed so far,
while the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled since
early last year due to Israel's refusal to carry out the long
overdue troop redeployment in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Need Permanent Air Base: Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash said Monday that to establish a permanent air base in
northern Cyprus has become an urgent issue because of the tension
on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
"Since a military air base has been provided for the
utilization of Greek military aircraft in the south, the
Gecitkale air base will be used as a permanent military base
ready to operate at any second," the Anatolia News Agency quoted
Denktash as saying.
</P>
<P>
At present, all necessary measures are being taken to that
effect, he said.
</P>
<P>
Six Turkish F-16 fighters flew to the Gecitkale airport on
June 18 in response to the landing of four F-16 fighters and two
C-130 transport planes of the Greek Air Force at Paphos air base
on the west coast of Cyprus on June 16.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have accused each other of escalating tension
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 the breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" which is recognized only by Ankara
against the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey stations more than 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Be in National Mourning for Late UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government decided
Monday to go into a 48-hour national mourning for the late United
Nations special representative to Angola, Alioune Blondin Beye.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government announced the decree here Monday,
saying that during the mourning period, governments at all levels
should fly the flag at half-mast.
</P>
<P>
Beye was confirmed dead in a plane crash near the commercial
capital Abidjan of Cote d'Ivoire. All on board including the two
crew of the South African Beechcraft 200 and five members of the
U.N. observer mission in Angola died in the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Beye was on a shuttle mission to Sao Tome and Principe, Gabon,
Togo, Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso to drum up support for a bid
to avert renewed bloodshed in war-ravaged Angola where he had
been the special representative since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of the Angolan government led by Minister of
Territorial Administer Faustino Muteka left Monday for Malian
capital Bamako to attend the burial of the late former Malian
foreign minister who had made great contribution to the Angolan
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Angolan political parties agreed that
Africa has lost one of the "distinguished sons," saying that Beye
had made great efforts to the complicated peace process in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the predecessor of Beye, Magaret Anstee
who had been U.N. Special Representative to Angola between 1991
and 1993, said in New York Monday that the passing away of Beye
dealt a "serious hit" to the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
Nontheless, Anstee expressed her hope that the 1994 Lusaka
Peace Protocol will be fully implemented.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Protection of Children in Armed Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese delegation
welcomes the Security Council's open debate on harmful impact of
armed conflict on children, Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Security Council, Ambassador Qin said the
question of protecting children in armed conflict has been a
matter of concern of various countries and organizations.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that at present, there still exist armed conflicts in
many places which not only endanger international peace and
security, but also bring tremendous damage to the people of the
countries and regions concerned. As one of the most vulnerable
social groups, children are particularly hurt by the armed
conflicts, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that in the armed conflict in various places of the
world, tens of millions of people losing their homes have become
displaced. What more is that millions of children have been
forcefully recruited as combatants and get directly involved in
the armed conflicts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qin said children represent the future of the world and the
international community should give special concern to the
question of protecting children in the armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the fundamental way of protecting children in the
armed conflicts is to effectively prevent, halt and eliminate
armed conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Governor's Race Already Running Hot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The candidates for governor of
Iowa, the United States, have already begun tearing into each
other shortly after the June primary.
</P>
<P>
Attack commercials are already flying, the candidates are
trading charges of illegal campaign cash, and the rhetoric has
escalated to levels usually reserved for late October, the
Associated Press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The presidential nominating season in the United States begins
with Iowa's precinct caucuses, so whoever is elected the next
governor will instantly become a power broker.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the governor's seat has been open in 16
years. Republican Governor Terry Branstad, first elected in 1982,
is stepping down.
</P>
<P>
"There's so much at stake," the report quoted Iowa Republican
chairman Steve Grubbs as saying. "There's nothing in Iowa politics
more important than an open governor's seat -- ever."
</P>
<P>
Democratic operative Phil Roeder said, "With the first open
seat in the better part of two decades, it should start off hot
and heavy."
</P>
<P>
The early favorite is Republican Jim Ross Lightfoot, who was in
Congress for a dozen years before losing a Senate race two years
ago. Lightfoot, 59, will face state Senator Tom Vilsack, a lawyer
who narrowly won the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
Trailing in the early polls, Vilsack, 47, has wasted absolutely
no time launching his campaign. He has ripped into Lightfoot as a
tool of Big Tobacco, and a political action committee created by
Democratic Senator Tom Harkin has begun airing commercials bashing
Lightfoot.
</P>
<P>
"It's just the nature of politics today," said former Iowa
Democratic chairman Eric Tabor. "There's more money and you have
to either define yourself or define your opponent early on. Both
parties understand there's a lot at stake."
</P>
<P>
Lightfoot has hired Steve Griener, a former top aide to House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, to run his campaign. Lightfoot, a
Republican conservative, picked in the June primary as his running
mate Almo Hawkins, a black woman and former TV reporter. Ms.
Hawkins has been head of the state's Department of Human Rights
for 15 years, working as an advocate for women, minorities and the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
Although minorities represent just three percent of Iowa's
population, Republican strategists say that Ms. Hawkins can lure
some of those Democratic-leaning voters into their camp.
</P>
<P>
Democrats say that Lightfoot is a harsh conservative who won't
be able to stand up under the spotlight of a gubernatorial
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore, House Democratic leader Richard
Gephardt and Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone are all scheduled to
campaign for Vilsack this summer. Jesse Jackson has already made
an appearance.
</P>
<P>
When Republicans held their state convention, 10 potential
candidates found time in their schedule to attend.

<HEADLINE> EU FMs Approve Strategic Partnership With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- European Union foreign ministers
approved Monday the European Commission's new strategy toward
China.
</P>
<P>
The approval, made during a foreign ministers council meeting
in Luxembourg, provides for closer engagement and cooperation
between China and the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
The new European Commission strategy includes concrete measures
to support China's economic integration into the global economy,
to reinforce its economic and social reforms and to encourage its
development into a more open society based on the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
One concrete measure was the commission proposal to elevate the
EU-China relationship to presidential level that is expected to
take effect in late October this year when European Commission
President Jacques Santer visits China, commission officials said.
</P>
<P>
The key of the new policy, the officials added, is to focus,
through trade negotiations, political dialogue, human rights and
economic cooperation, on the single goal of assisting China in
building a globally competitive economy serving a free and open
society based on the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
European Commission Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan said, "This
new policy now sends an important further signal to the Chinese
leadership: the realization of China's potential as a leading
power in Asia over the long term will hinge on its ability to
match its domestic reforms with a commitment to open markets on a
world scale."
</P>
<P>
He pledged that with this policy endorsed by the governments of
the 15 EU member states, the European Union is to support the
internal reform and external liberalization in China.
</P>
<P>
"The world will gain from China's development into an open and
prosperous society and an equal partner in the world economy.
Europe must now work to strengthen its economic partnership with
China," the commission vice-president said.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Urges Solution to Middle East Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz
Monday urged more efforts to solve the crisis in the Middle East
peace process, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During a speech to the Consultative Council in the Saudi
capital Riyadh, King Fahd said a solution must be found to break
the deadlock in the peace process in order to restore the full
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. He renewed his
support to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The king hailed the efforts exerted by peace-loving countries
and organizations in supporting the Arab bid to realize a just
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He said that Saudi Arabia would continue its policy of
deepening ties with other countries, particularly Muslim and Arab
nations, for the sake of achieving a just and comprehensive peace
in the region.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd also pledged that his country would always remain a
peace-loving nation, and would provide aid to help all Arabs and
Muslims solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
The king's remarks was another indication that the prolonged
deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has caused
increasing concern among the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has already voiced its support to the call by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to convene an Arab summit to
confront Israel's policy of intransigence.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Causes Controversy by Calling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
caused a political storm in Israel's Knesset (Parliament) Monday
by calling for early general elections.
</P>
<P>
Knesset members reacted to the president's remarks following
party lines, with the left-wingers expressing support while the
right-wingers criticizing him of intervening politics.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, who has called for early
elections himself recently, said that if anyone goes to the
streets of Tel Aviv or Jerusalem, he will find that people are
thinking in the same way as what Weizman has said.
</P>
<P>
He refused to comment if the president's words have constituted
an intervention in the politics, saying that Weizman was "saying
what he feels."
</P>
<P>
During a condolence visit Monday to the family of Orr Cohen, a
soldier killed last week in south Lebanon, Weizman said that since
the peace process is limping along, the best thing to do now is to
organize general elections.
</P>
<P>
Several cabinet ministers quickly responded by criticizing him
of taking sides with the left-wing parties by making the remarks.
</P>
<P>
In the Knesset, Likud member Naomi Blumenthal said that "it is
not right" for the president to intervene in a role that he was
not voted to play.
</P>
<P>
Another Likud member Uzi Landau said the president should play
a role above day-to-day politics.
</P>
<P>
But Labor Knesset member Haggai Merom dismissed the complaints
as "hypocritical."
</P>
<P>
The president was "just saying the truth" and people have to
accept Weizman "as a political president," he said.
</P>
<P>
With his words and manner getting him in hot water time and
again, Weizman has recently been more critical of the impasse in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move last week, he did not speak at an economic
conference in Israel as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"I reached a conclusion that if I speak, it would be an angry
speech," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he was disappointed with the fact that
a decision by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on further
withdrawal from the West Bank "is not near."
</P>
<P>
Although the post of the Israeli president is ceremonial,
people believe that Weizman's words carry a certain weight.
</P>
<P>
Avoiding a direct comment, Netanyahu said on Monday that no
pressure or individual will steer him away from "pursuing a true
peace" with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Once again, he blamed the Palestinians for the stalemate of the
peace process, saying the main thing now holding up progress is
Palestinians' refusal to honor their commitments they have made in
the signed agreements.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Joins UN Weapons Protocols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has joined two
United Nations weapons protocols which prohibit or restrict the
use of land mines, booby-traps and blinding laser weapons.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has declared its consent to be bound to the
amended protocol II and IV of the Convention on Prohibitions or
Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons, the
Foreign Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was deposited at the U.N. Secretary-General's
office in New York, the United States, on June 26, the ministry
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Certain conventional weapons, or CCW, are weapons deemed to be
excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects.
</P>
<P>
South Africa acceded to the convention and its protocols I, II
and III in September 1995. The convention, which came into force
in December 1983, has to date been ratified by 70 states.
</P>
<P>
The amended protocol II, adopted in May 1996, requires greater
discrimination between civilian and military objectives requiring
advance warning of mines, booby-traps and other devices.
</P>
<P>
The new protocol IV, adopted by state parties in October 1995,
places a prohibition on the use of blinding laser weapons
designed to cause blindness.
</P>
<P>
In another statement on Monday, the ministry said that South
Africa has also agreed to ratify the Convention on the
Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of
Anti-Personnel Mines, and on Their Destruction.
</P>
<P>
This followed the earlier ratification of the convention by
the South African parliament in May 1998.

LUSAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Army Commander Lieutenant
General Solomon Mumbi Monday highly praised the military
cooperation between China and Zambia and hoped China to continue
support his country in military training.
</P>
<P>
At a reception dinner held here in honor of the nine-member

household name in his country because it has made great
contributions to Zambia's development at both civil and military
levels.
</P>
<P>
Mumbi, who was trained by Chinese military experts in the
1970s, also praised China for opening its doors to train the

<HEADLINE> U.N. Can Play Bigger Role in Protecting Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 29 (xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations can lead the way by sending forth a clear message
that targeting, use ad abuse of children are simply unacceptable,
Olara Otunnu, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative
for children on armed conflict, said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The message needs to go out that it cannot be
`buiness-as-usual' when you systematically commit atrocities and
abuses against children," Otunnu said.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu made the remarks at the Security Council which opened a
debate Monday on protecting children in armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Two million children have been killed and more than six
million seriously wounded in wars and civil wars around the world
in the past decade alone," he told the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"On the eve of the new millennium, we are witnessing an
abomination -- an abomination directed against children in the
context of armed conflict. At this moment, in approximately 50
countries around the world, children are suffering from the impact
of armed conflict in its midst and in its aftermath," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the last decade alone we have seen two million children
killed, over one million orphaned, six million seriously injured
or permanently disabled, 12 million made homeless and 10 million
left with serious psychological trauma," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "Children, especially young women, have been made the
targets of rape and other forms of sexual violence on a large
scale."
</P>
<P>
He said half the world's refugees and displaced persons were
children and an estimated 800 youngsters were killed or maimed by
landmines every month.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that a quarter of a million young persons
under the age of 18 are currently under arms, serving as child
soldiers in various theaters of conflict around the world," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu said the gap between the international conventions and
norms designed to protect the children in armed conflicts and the
actual situation on the ground was unacceptablely wide. He called
on the Security Council to play a bigger role in protecting
children in armed conflicts.

"I know the Romanian playmaker Hagi, personally, but I'm not too
afraid of him," said the Real Madrid forward.

He added, "The match against Romania looks evenly balanced. It's a
50-50 match and I don't think either side is favorite to win."

Suker said, "I hope to play well if I'm chosen. In fact, I'm not
worried about whether I play or not, but I would like to know who my
teammates will be."

<HEADLINE> Blair, Ahern Meet on Ulster March Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, held emergency talks on
Tuesday to discuss the security implications of an attempt to
limit a Protestant march this weekend.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said the two leaders agreed that
"everyone in positions of responsibility must do all they can to
ensure that it passes off peacefully."
</P>
<P>
The leaders held talks for 20 minutes in Frankfurt to discuss
the Northern Ireland peace process. The talks preceded an EU
meeting to mark the launch of the European Central Bank, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland is bracing itself for possible sectarian
street violence at the parade on Sunday. The Protestant marchers
have been barred from a Roman Catholic enclave in Drumcree, close
to the strongly pro-British town of Portadown. But they vowed on
Monday to continue their marches as planned.
</P>
<P>
The parade by the Orange Order, viewed by Northern Ireland's
Catholic minority as a threatening expression of Protestant
triumphalism, touched off rioting across the province in 1996 and
1997.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the two leaders also expressed their
confidence in the new Northern Ireland Assembly which was elected
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Both saw the (assembly) elections as a further significant
step towards the new politics the people want. Both are confident
the assembly can and will work," the spokesman said.

LHASA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 pigeons airlifted from
Shanghai settled down today on the square in front of the Potala
Palace in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Local families came to enjoy the birds this afternoon, when
they wandered freely looking for food.

Shanghai has donated more than 5,000 pigeons to some tourism
sites in China since 1996, and Lhasa is the highest place for
these birds, according to Chen Qing, director of the management
department for Shanghai's pigeons.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumers' confidence in
the economy rose in June to a 29-year high, as Americans remained
optimistic about the labor market and economic growth in coming
months.
</P>
<P>
The New York based Conference Board reported Tuesday that its
index of consumer confidence rose from a revised 136.3 in May to
137.6 in June, a rise larger than Wall Street had expected.
</P>
<P>
June's gain pushed the index above the 29-year high of 137.4 set
in February. In June 1969, the index once reached 137.9.
</P>
<P>
Economists regard the consumer sentiment as important because
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The report comes as economists look for new data for signs
pointing to the direction of the economy and any inflationary
pressures and as Federal Reserve begins two days of meetings in
Washington to review interest rate policy.

NEW DELHI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- India Tuesday announced its
decision to reopen a diplomatic mission in Suva, capital of Fiji,
eight years after it was closed down.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, New Delhi lifted its trade embargo
against Fiji which was imposed a few years ago in protest against
the denial of certain political rights to ethnic Indians in Fiji.
After the imposition of the trade embargo, Fiji asked India to
close down its mission in the South Pacific island nation.

An Indian foreign office spokesman said here Tuesday that
reopening a resident Indian mission in Suva would contribute to
further consolidation of close and friendly ties between India and

BAGHDAD, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Neither Iraqi authorities nor mass

fired a missile strike on a radar station south of the country
Tuesday.

The zone was imposed by U.S., British and French forces in 1991
with a claimed aim of protecting Shiite Muslim Iraqis from
alleged government oppression. An extension of the zone in 1996
reaches the 33rd parallel.

<HEADLINE> NBA to Impose Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- With negotiations on a new
labor agreement at a standstill, the National Basketball
Association announced on Monday that it would lock out its players
Tuesday night until a new collective bargaining agreement is
reached.
</P>
<P>
The lockout will, in essence, shut down the league. Teams will
be barred from talking to their players, trades and free agent
signings will be prohibited and summer leagues will be canceled.
</P>
<P>
"The expired collective bargaining agreement between the NBA
and its players did not work." said NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ
Granik.
</P>
<P>
"That agreement guaranteed the players at least 48% of league
revenue. The parties expressly agreed that the deal was not
working if player compensation exceed 52%. The past season players
compensation exceeded 57%."
</P>
<P>
"We have made a series of proposals to the players under which
salaries would continue to increase - but at a slower rate than
under the expired deal," Granik said. "Regrettably, the players
have rejected all of these proposals. The NBA will not operate
until we reach a new agreement that is fair to both parties."
</P>
<P>
This will be third lockout in the history of the NBA, the only
major American professional sports league never to have lost a
game to a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
A lockout in the summer of 1995 lasted three months, and a
lockout in 1996 lasted only a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
A handful of players who were to be paid part of their salaries
this summer will not receive those paychecks until the lockout
ends.
</P>
<P>
Also, teams will not be permitted to conduct practices, summer
camps, workouts, coaching sessions or team meetings. Some
previously scheduled charity games will be allowed to proceed.

<HEADLINE> Women Surpass Men in Schooling in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Young women in the United
States are completing high school and graduating from college at
higher rates than their male peers, according to the Census
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said in a report Monday that in 1997, 89 percent of
women ages 25 to 29 had finished high school, compared with 86
percent of men the same age.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times quoted census officials as saying that women
in the 25 to 29 age group also led men when it came to college
completion rates: 29.3 percent for women, compared with 26.3
percent for men in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It was the second year that young women had outpaced men in
education attainment. In 1996, women topped men 28.2 percent to
26.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the performance, the bureau found that there was almost
indistinguishable when it came to finishing high school or
completing college in the 10-year period before 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, in the last two years, young women have spurted ahead,
the first time in the America's history that women are better
educated than their male counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the trend, the Census Bureau said that more women
are delaying both marriage and childbirth, two events that
traditionally have caused women to halt their education. In
addition, social attitudes have changed drastically with regard to
women earning college degrees and entering the professional work
force.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, large-scale U.S. military action that usually pushed
up male school enrollment has been largely absent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that young blacks have almost caught
up with whites in the percentage graduating from high school, 86
percent of blacks age 25 to 29 were high school graduate in last
year, compared to 87 percent of whites.

<TEXT>
<P>
FRANKFURT, Germany, June 30 (Xinhua) -- European Union states
held an official ceremony here Tuesday to mark the founding of the
European Central Bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony at the Old Opera House of Frankfurt,
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl described the establishment of the
ECB as "an important milestone in the history of the European
integration."
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that under the guidance of the European
Central Bank, the planned single European currency, the euro,
which is to be launched on January 1, 1999, was set to be a great
success like the German mark.
</P>
<P>
The ECB was formally established on June 1, and will act as the
monetary watchdog for the euro. It will set the common monetary
policy and common interest rates for all 11 EU countries which
participate in the first wave of the euro introduction next
January.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the ceremony, ECB President Wim Duisenberg said
that by fulfilling its mandate of maintaining price stability, the
ECB would contribute to creating the appropriate conditions for
sustainable growth of incomes and employment in the euro area.
</P>
<P>
However, he also stressed that the new central bank would have
to first face the most important challenge, to win public trust.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony on Tuesday was attended by hundreds of European
political and business leaders including European Commission
President Jacques Santer, British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima, and the central bank governors
of EU countries.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the event, Santer noted that the ECB would
face the big challenge of building authority by ensuring a stable
common currency for EU countries in the long run.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that with the establishment of the ECB and
planned launch of the euro, European countries must get ready to
take new international responsibilities to cope with challenges
such as the recent Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Australian Firms Rush to File Year 2000 Responses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Australia's public
companies Tuesday rushed to lodge their compliance responses on
the Year 2000 bug with the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) before
Tuesday night's deadline.
</P>
<P>
But some companies appeared prepared to gamble by forgoing
compliance costs and risking litigation in some areas of their
business.
</P>
<P>
The deadline set by the ASX for disclosure of compliance was at
8 p.m. (local time) Tuesday. But by 7 p.m. about 105 of
Australia's public companies had still to respond to the ASX's
demand.
</P>
<P>
Under the listing laws, the ASX requires all public companies
to provide information about the status of their Year 2000 bug
projects.
</P>
<P>
In a last-minute dash Tuesday, about 370 Australian companies
swamped the ASX in Sydney with their notices, the largest number
in any single day.
</P>
<P>
By 6 p.m. Tuesday, all the top 20 companies had lodged their
statements with the ASX.
</P>
<P>
Those that fail to do so will be in breach of listing rule 3.1
and be named to help investors make more informed investment
decisions, an ASX spokeswoman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The total compliance cost for Australia's public companies is
yet to be finalized but estimates range from 900 million U.S.
dollars to 1.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Australia's telecommunications giant Telstra said Monday it
would spend up to 300 million U.S. dollars to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
Among Australia's major banks, the National Australia Bank said
it would spend 153 million U.S. dollars, Australia and New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. said it would invest 109 million U.S. dollars,
and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia said it would spend 69
million U.S. dollars in solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
Westpac bank, St. George bank, and Colonial State Bank would
also pump 24 million to 36 million U.S. dollars to fix the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Insurance giant AMP Ltd. Tuesday said it would spend around 81
million U.S. dollars on upgrading its computer systems.
</P>
<P>
Australia's biggest airline Qantas has been hit hard and is
spending 88 million U.S. dollars to ensure all systems in check.
</P>
<P>
The problems of Year 2000 bug, also known as the millennium
bug, have evolved as most computer software use only two digits to
specify a year. This means that the year 2000 would appear as 00
and would be read by a computer as 1900, potentially causing
errors on computer systems with disastrous consequences
particularly to banks and financial markets, if it is not solved
before January 1, 2000.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Consider Increase Asian Berths in 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The international soccer governing body
FIFA will consider increasing the number of Asian qualifiers in the
2002 World Cup finals to be co-hosted by Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
FIFA Director of Communication Keith Cooper said on Tuesday with
Japan and South Korea qualifying for the 2002 finals automatically,
the remaining 1.5 berths would appear too few for Asia.
</P>
<P>
FIFA will begin to discuss the issue later this year, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
Asia presently has 3.5 berths. The one-half of a berth refers to a
slot for which the third placer in Asian qualifying round has to vie
against the Oceanian winner.
</P>
<P>
He said as it was highly unlikely that FIFA would further inflate
the present 32-team format, the additional Asian berths will mean a
cut in another federation.
</P>
<P>
Cooper praised the eco-onsciousness of Japan and South Korean fans
at these World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
He said supporters from the two countries, who have already
eliminated, brought colorful plastic bags into stadium to wave in
their group games.
</P>
<P>
After the matches the fans packed their gabbages in the bags.

<HEADLINE> China Strives to Fight Against HIV/AIDS: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Government departments at all
levels in China have made great efforts in the prevention and
control of HIV/AIDS in the past decade, said vice health minister
Yin Dakui here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Laws, regulations and guidelines on the prevention and control
of HIV/AIDS have been drawn up based on preliminary data on the
trends of the epidemic through the establishment of surveillance
systems, Yin told the 12th World AIDS Conference being held in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
From the identification of the first case of HIV infection in
China in 1985 to the end of March 1998, a cumulative total of more
than 10 million people underwent testing for HIV antibodies, 9,970
cases of HIV infection were reported in individuals in 30
provinces, autonomous regions or municipalities, according to Yin.
</P>
<P>
He said that there had been 290 cases of AIDS, and 173 deaths
in China. HIV infections in ethnic minorities account for 36.3
percent of the total cumulative reported infections for the
country.
</P>
<P>
Intravenous drug users account for 66.9 percent of all those
infected with HIV, Yin said. The proportion attributable to sexual
transmission is rising annually.
</P>
<P>
To fight against HIV/AIDS, expert advisory groups, associations
and foundations have been set up, and scientific research projects
have been conducted to investigate the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS,
strategies for prevention and control, vaccines, and traditional
Chinese medicine therapies.
</P>
<P>
China has established cooperative relationships with
international organizations like the Joint United Nations Program
on HIV/AIDS, The U.N. Development Program, the U.N. Children's
Fund, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, the U.N. Fund
for Population Activities, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, U.S. Veteran Pilots Meet Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Foes can turn into friends over
time. This is true in today's founding of the Han Decai-Edward
Foundation named after two old-time enemies, one veteran Chinese
pilot, the other American.
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old Edward Harold and 64-year-old Han Decai were
both here at the founding ceremony. From now on, they will work
together as friends to push forward economic and cultural
exchanges between their motherlands.
</P>
<P>
"We used to be enemies, but now we are friends, and we will be
close friends in the future," said Han. "We both are old. It is
our common aspiration to do more in the interest of the Chinese
and American people in the rest of our life."
</P>
<P>
Forty five years ago, Harold, an ace pilot with 13 years of air
experience, intruded into China's territorial air space in the
northeast. His fighter plane was shot down by 19-year-old Han
Decai.
</P>
<P>
During his captivation after he bailed out of the plane and
landed in Chinese territory by parachute, Harold failed to meet
with Han in spite of his request out of curiosity.
</P>
<P>
Their first meeting came last year in Shanghai thanks to the
arrangement by the Beijing Aviation Association and an American
ace pilot association of which Harold is a member. Han had already
retired from his position as deputy commander of the Air Force of
the Nanjing Military Area Command.
</P>
<P>
They promised to meet again when U.S. President Bill Clinton is
in China.
</P>
<P>
Han explained the reason why they chose the occasion of
Clinton's China visit to mark the ceremony by saying the
significance lies in the fact that both the Chinese and U.S.
governments and people are working to promote peace and mutual
understanding.
</P>
<P>
War is temporary, but peace and friendship are everlasting,
said Harold, who arrived in Nanjing on June 26.
</P>
<P>
"Understanding between deadly enemies like us can bring them
together, and make them friends. Therefore, I believe for the
Chinese and American people in general, understanding can all the
more make them friends," Han said.

GENEVA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The first shipments of AIDS drugs
since the launch of the UNAIDS Drug Access Initiative in late 1997
have arrived in Cote d'Ivoire and Uganda, the two countries'

<P>
SAINT-ETIENNE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The infamous "Hand of God" goal
in the 1986 World Cup finals was not Diego Maradona's fault, according
to England coach Glenn Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
"The 'hand of God' wasn't Maradona's fault, nor Argentina's fault,
but the referee's," said Hoddle, whose team will meet the South
Americans in the second round here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the quarterfinals in 1986, Maradona deflected the ball into the
net with his hand but the referee failed to spot it.
</P>
<P>
"The match against Argentina won't be a revenge of the
quarterfinals in 1986, we just want to qualify," said Hoddle, who
himself was in the squad 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle said the present team was better than that of 1986, even
though they sometimes showed the lack of experience.
</P>
<P>
"In four years time, the young players will develop their
potential," said Hoddle.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: European Central Bank (ECB) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- With six months to go to the formal
launch of the single European currency, the euro, European Union
countries held a ceremony Tuesday in the German financial center
of Frankfurt to celebrate the founding of the monetary watchdog
for the euro -- the European Central Bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
From January 1999, the Frankfurt-based ECB will take over the
power from national central banks of 11 EU countries
participating in the euro to set the common monetary policies and
common interest rates for the whole euro area.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the fact that the euro will become the currency for
not one nation but a group of them, the single European currency
will be run by a federal monetary system called the European
System of Central Banks. It will consist of the ECB and 11
national central banks of the euro member states.
</P>
<P>
Daily operations of the ECB will be managed by a six-member
executive board comprising the bank's president, Wim Duisenberg,
and five other board members: Christian Noyer of France, Eugenio
Domingo Solans of Spain, Sirkka Haemaelaeinen of Finland, Otmar
Issing of Germany and Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa of Italy.
</P>
<P>
But the supreme decision-making body of the ECB will be its
governing council which groups the bank's six executive board
members with central bank governors of the 11 euro member states.
Each of the 17 council members will have an equal vote in ECB's
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
The executive board and the 11 national central banks will be
responsible for implementing monetary policies decided by the
governing council.
</P>
<P>
In order to set up its own organization and ensure a smooth
transition from the current national monetary policies to the
future single monetary policy, the ECB actually began to be
functional on June 1 with its first executive board meeting
convening June 2, and the first governing council meeting on June
9.
</P>
<P>
The ECB governing council has decided to meet on the first
Tuesday of every month in the future. Key issues such as the
minimum reserves of the bank, and which monetary instruments would
be used, will be decided in the following months.
</P>
<P>
The council has also decided that the ECB will have four
billion euro in startup capital.

BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Since 1981, 17 ports have been
built on the Yangtze River to handle international container
transport business.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjianggang, a port in east China's Jiangsu Province, was
the earliest port for international container transport on the
Yangtze. Afterwards, such ports have been built in Jiangyin,
Nantong, Nanjing, Tongling, Wuhan, Yichang, Chongqing and other

<P>
These ports handled 433,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units)
of containers in 1997, 6.7 times the 1989 figure, according to
recent statistics from the Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
About 84 percent of the handling capacity was contributed by

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Better-than-expected trade data
and a stronger Japanese yen helped the Australian dollar fight
back Tuesday, with the currency rallying three quarters of a U.S.
cent into the close of the financial year of 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
Domestic statistics revealing a better-than-expected trade
deficit and an increase in Australia's exports to Asia were one
reason for the local currency's surge Tuesday, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the buoyant mood was a stronger Japanese yen against
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the local session in Sydney, the Australian
dollar was changing hands at 61.47 U.S. cents, significantly
higher than 60.68 U.S. cents late Monday.
</P>
<P>
Other traders attributed the rise to a firmer-than-expected
trade position in May.
</P>
<P>
While Australia's trade position continued to suffer in May,
with its balance on goods and services widening by one million
Australian dollars (614,000 U.S. dollars) to record a 315 million
U.S. dollar deficit, the seasonally adjusted figure fell within
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank economist Richard Yetsenga said the data
indicated that Australia's exports, in level terms, to the most
troubled Asian economies appear to have bottomed.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said both exports and
imports of goods and services fell by an adjusted 1.0 percent in
May.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also closed Tuesday 86.14 Japanese yen
from 86.02 yen and at 1.1111 German marks from 1.0990.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar began the 1997-1998 financial year 13
U.S. cents higher at 74.62 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Asian economic crisis which has rocked the region over the
past year has been to blame for the erosion in the value of the
local currency.

<HEADLINE> More Closure May Hit S. Korean Banking Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 30 (Xinhua) -- More closures and mergers may appear
in South Korea's ailing banking system under a government program
of restructuring the the financial sector, South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Those which cannot survive international competition will go
out of business,'' the president told a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
South Korea on Monday kickstarted the effort at financial
reform by shutting down five non-viable banks whose assets and key
operations would be absorbed by five other big banks.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed the designation earlier this month of
55 non-financial companies which were denied further bank credit
and allowed to go out of business.
</P>
<P>
The president refuted allegations that political considerations
and other motives influenced his government's selction of the five
non-viable banks.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The government observed laws and handled the case
fairly".
</P>
<P>
The listing of banks and companies as non-viable is at the core
of corporate and financial restructuring mandated under the nearly
60 billion U.S. dollars bailout by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
The IMF deal came after South Korea, which once enjoyed a
dynamic economic growth, plunged into economic stagnation late
last year due to massive corporate failures and bad loans by
financial institutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Tuesday urged the international community to pressure Israel to
commit itself to its obligations of peace, the Voice of Palestine
(VOP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his talks with visiting Spanish
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, Arafat, President of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), blamed Israel for causing
the stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks have been stalled since March last year when
Israelis started the construction of Jewish settlement in
traditionally Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Spain and the European union (EU) played an important role in
recovering the peace process and the international community must
put more pressure on Israel to move the process forward," Arafat
said.
</P>
<P>
Besides efforts made by Spain in the peace process, Arafat
also thanked Spain for its economic assistance to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Spanish guest said that the coming few weeks
will be decisive for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the coming weeks are important," Aznar said, adding
that "the Mideast peace negotiators are running out of time."
</P>
<P>
He said the peace process is going through a difficult time,
urging the parties concerned to continue to have the will to go
forward.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two leaders exchanged views on the
current developments of the process, EU's role in reviving the
deadlocked peace process and the economic cooperation between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Aznar arrived in Gaza Tuesday morning for a one-day visit
after spending two days in Israel, during which he held talks
with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu mainly on the
peace process issue.
</P>
<P>
This was Aznar's second visit to Gaza and the previous visit
was three years ago when he was the opposition leader in Spain.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Spain hosted a Middle East conference that opened the
door to Israel's peace talks with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Sets Priorities for New Philippine Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- New Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Tuesday set forth a series of priority areas and a code of
conduct for his new cabinet soon after he was worn in as the
country's 13th head of state.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, 61, was sworn in at noon as president to replace Fidel
Ramos. Under the Philippine Constitution, Estrada will serve a
single six-year term.
</P>
<P>
At the first cabinet meeting in the presidential palace here,
Estrada asked his cabinet to review the remaining budget for 1998
and identify areas for further savings.
</P>
<P>
He urged the cabinet members to identify action steps to
institute reforms in the bureaucracy, including down-sizing,
anti-graft and anti-corruption measures, and improvement of
delivery of services.
</P>
<P>
The new president also asked the new cabinet members to
identify proposed reform legislation for their respective sectors
or departments, which he said should be consistent with the
framework of governance of his administration.
</P>
<P>
Announcing a 10-point Code of Conduct for cabinet members at
the meeting, Estrada urged his cabinet to "work together as a team
in the task of nation-building."
</P>
<P>
"Abuse of power and influence peddling especially by my
relatives and friends will not be tolerated in the Estrada
Administration. Institute immediate measures to eliminate
opportunities for graft and corruption. Weed out the corruption
and the incompetent," he said, explaining one of the 10 points.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also urged the cabinet members to "immediately resolve
the problems and issues affecting your areas of concern, including
those raised in the media, to avoid causing great injury or burden
to our people and the country."
</P>
<P>
Of the 22 cabinet members, four were retained from the Ramos
administration. They are Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, Public
Works and Highways Secretary Gregorio Vigilar, Science and
Technology Secretary William Padolina, and former executive
secretary Alexander Aguirre, who was appointed as director general
of the National Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Editorial to Mark 77th Birth Anniversary of CPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily will
publish an editorial tomorrow to mark the 77th anniversary of the
founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and extend
festival greetings to CPC members of different circles.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, entitled "Unify Our Thinking And Concentrate Our
Efforts", says that as China's state enterprise reform, financial
reform and government institutional reform are all entering a
critical period, the leadership of the CPC has become more
important.
</P>
<P>
It says that a notice, to be issued Wednesday by the CPC
Central Committee on the study of Deng Xiaoping Theory, will
elaborate on the importance and urgency of the study of the theory.
</P>
<P>
The notice, which establishes new requirements for research and
study on the theory, insists that CPC members, especially those
who are senior government officials, should have a thorough
and deep understanding of the theory.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that all CPC members should manage to
reach a common understanding of the present domestic and
international circumstances and, under the correct guidance of the
CPC Central Committee, work whole-heartedly to overcome
difficulties ahead.
</P>
<P>
The pivotal role of the Party and the concerted efforts of the
nation are of significant importance to the final success,
the editorials emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 years of revolutionary struggles have helped the
Party to come to the conclusion that a great and promising Party
should be able to mobilize the people and unite with all forces
that can be united.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that CPC members should be aware of their
historical responsibilities, never neglect the rights and
interests of the masses, and dedicate themselves whole-heartedly
to the great cause of communism.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls on all CPC members to rally around the CPC
Central Committee, with Jiang Zemin as the core, and hold high the
great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory to unite China's 1.2
billion people to meet new challenges and achieve new
successes.

<HEADLINE> Match against England to be Hardest: Passarella </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAINT-ETIENNE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Argentine coach Daniel Alberto
Passarella said their match against England would be the hardest among
all second-round games in the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
"We can win this 'classic' match as we have met England several
times at this level. It's the hardest second round match," he said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Passarella said England was a dynamic team with various styles and
possesses some excellent players especially in attack.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I know Glenn Hoddle better as a player than as a coach.
He was a very talented player with a lot of character, very wise on
the pitch.
</P>
<P>
"As a coach, he has changed the English style of playing, making it
more practical"
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Tuesday's match was totally different from the
1986 World Cup clash in which Argentina won 2-1 on the infamous "Hand
of God" goal by Diego Maradona.
</P>
<P>
"The match against England will be nothing like that of 1986, we
want to be original. We won't do a Maradona. We'll do our best to
practice fair play," he added.

HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A set of wax figures depicting
late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and former British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher were donated to the Hong Kong Museum of
History here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The set of two wax figures, named "The Historic Moment," were
produced by Pang Liming and Ai Desheng, artists of China's Tianjin
Academy of Fine Arts, to commemorate the first anniversary of Hong
Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
The wax figures were donated to the Hong Kong museum by two
Tianjin-based Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
At his meeting with Thatcher, the then British prime minister,
in Beijing in September 1982, Deng stated that China was to resume
the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 by implementing
the concept of "one country, two systems." The historic meeting
served as the prelude to the two-year-long Sino-British diplomatic
negotiations, which led to the signing of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration in 1984 on the question of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The wax figures, together with two sculptures, gifts presented
by two Chinese provinces to the Hong Kong Special Administration
Region (SAR) government last July, are to be on display in the
museum for two months starting on July 1.

Group (JLG) started its 32nd plenary session here on Tuesday, to

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Foreign Engagement in Postal Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen cooperation
with foreign business circles in its postal service and use
foreign capital, equipment and technology to develop the sector, a
spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the Directorate General of Posts, Postal and
Telecommunications said at a news conference that the 22nd
Congress of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) planned in Beijing
next year will provide opportunities for China to upgrade its
postal technology with foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
China will hold an international postal technology and
equipment exhibition during the conference. The exhibition will
demonstrate China's achievements in the sector in the past 50
years, the spokesman said, and help foreign business people learn
about the Chinese market and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Posts and telecommunications are key industries slated to be
developed rapidly in China in the 21st century. The postal sector
last year had an income of 27.4 billion yuan (3 billion
U.S. dollars) in business volume, an increase of 53 percent over
1996.
</P>
<P>
China is constructing a computer network to provide
comprehensive postal services nationwide, opening more postal
routes and establishing new auto-disposal mail centers. These
areas should be attractive to foreign investors, according to the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The UPU is a special institute of the United Nations, whose
22nd congress will be held in Beijing Aug. 23-Sept. 15 of next
year, with 2,000 delegates expected to attend from 189 countries
and international organizations.

<HEADLINE> Former Royal Summer Resort Becomes Attraction for All (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"In the half century after the founding of the People's
Republic of China, Beidaihe has gradually changed from a special
summer resort for the royal family into a paradise for all
citizens," said Meng Fanxiang, head of the Beidaihe District.
</P>
<P>
Beidaihe, whose permanent urban population is less than 30,000
was frequented by 2.8 million people last year. The historic
record for visitors to Beidaihe was 5 million.
</P>
<P>
Even with so many visitors, the official said, there are few
complaints of overcrowding. "The coastline around Beidaihe is 260
km long;, we have enough places for every visitor," he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts on scenery and tourism often highlight advantages in
the scenic resort. It is only several hours drive from the Chinese
capital of Beijing with wide and comfortable beaches, pleasant
weather, green hills, flowing rivers and forests.
</P>
<P>
In the Beidaihe area, you can see the starting point of the
Great Wall -- Shanhaiguan -- and Laolongtou, a unique section of
the Great Wall which was built into the sea.
</P>
<P>
Now, Beidaihe and Laolongtou are both listed among the 40 best
tourist attractions in China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, bird-watching is becoming increasingly popular in
Beidaihe, with a foliage coverage of 44 percent. Through
telescopes people watch birds over the sea waves, on beaches and
spotted in the dense woods.
</P>
<P>
"I and my group have seen some 300 species of birds here in the
past few days; it is really one of the best places to watch birds
and enjoy the beauty of nature," said a British ornithologist who
has been to Beidaihe six times.
</P>
<P>
Another bird-watching lover, Dr. T.Martin from the Cambridge
University, wrote a book on his experience and studies in
Beidaihe, which led to the opening of an international seminar on
water bird conservation in Beidaihe. Experts and officials
attending the seminar had even worked out a "Beidaihe Declaration"
to protect birds and their habitats.
</P>
<P>
To mark the 100th anniversary of the Beidaihe summer resort,
the Beidaihe local government recently decided to build an even
better home for birds -- hundreds of birds of varying species will
live in a newly planted forest.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our efforts can not only add beauty to nature, but
help raise the natural conversational awareness among visitors,"
Liu Hongbin, a local official said.

BEIDAIHE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Asking for directions can be a
big problem in Beidaihe, a famous summer resort in China's north
coast. In winter, there are very few people in the streets; and in
summer nine-tenths of the passers-by are tourists.
</P>
<P>
This year signifies the centennial of Beidaihe summer resort,
which is located in Qinhuangdao City of Hebei Province. Most train
tickets to the small town are booked even before the hot weather
arrives.
</P>
<P>
One government employee Zhang Huiqin in Beijing said that as
early as April, a long list of names wishing to spend their
one-week summer vacation in Beidaihe has been decided in his
work unit.
</P>
<P>
"I come here almost every year; it is beautiful, clean and not
polluted," she said.
</P>

Though most holiday-goers come to escape the summer heat and
enjoy the beaches, and some come to view unique natural landscape,
such as a couple from east China's Zhejiang Province.

"I feel the name of Beidaihe means so much beauty and
attraction, with a kind of mystery," said Wang Cunzhao, the
husband.
</P>
<P>
"I knew when I was a child that Beidaihe is a resort where
high-ranking government officials used to have meetings during the
summertime, but only very recently did I know that it also opened
to common people long ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he and his wife had decided to come and stay longer
next year.
</P>
<P>
According to historical documents, the first villa in Beidaihe
appeared in 1893, and most visitors then were foreign business
people.
</P>
<P>
In 1898, the imperial court of late Qing dynasty (1644-1911)
then decided formerly to turn Beidahe into a summer resort.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Stocks Down Amid Worry About Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Seoul stock prices edged down 0.24
percent Tuesday because of concern over reform of the banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
The composite stock price index dropped 0.72 points to close
the day at 297.88. Losers outnumbered gainers at 497 to 286, with
101 issues remaining unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Trading was light with 52.5 million shares worth 248.2 billion
won (about 177.2 million U.S. dollars) changing hands, compared
with the Monday's 65.4 million issues.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the South Korean government began its restructuring
of financial institutions by ordering five non-viable banks to be
merged by five well-managed banks.
</P>
<P>
Investment sentiment was depressed as backlash erupted from
employees of the five ailing banks Daedong, Dongnam, Dongwha,
Kyungki and Chungchong, protesting the government's decision.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the closure of five weak banks announced
will make good banks weak and worsen their asset quality, said Lee
Yong, manager of Daewoo Securities Co. "Thus, I think, the
government failed to ease anxieties among foreign investors over
their holdings of financial issues.''
</P>
<P>
Due to growing concerns over the financial restructuring,
shares of most banks, brokerage houses, and insurance firms
retreated substantially, stock dealers said.

<P>
CAIRO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Head of the Egyptian-Moroccan Businessmen Council
Yamani Felfilah said they plan to set up the first share holding
Arab navigation company serving North Africa Arab countries, the
Arab daily Alalam Alyoum reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The main business of the planned company, with an investment of
100 million U.S. dollars, will be for passenger and cargo
transport.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem -- israel's prospective purchase of Egyptian gas
could push bilateral trade into the multi-billion-dollar range,
Israel-Egypt Chamber of Industry and Commerce President Albert
Papouchado said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Presently their trade volume stands at 100 million U.S. dollars
each year. Negotiation between Israel and Egypt for the purchase
of gas produced in the Sinai peninsula broke down more than a year
ago, leading Israel to consider importing liquefied natural gas
from Nigeria, Norway, Australia or constructing a pipeline from
regions of the former Soviet Union or Qatar.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Foreign ministers from the nine Arab countries along
the southern Mediterranean basin will meet in Cairo on July 22 to
discuss the setup of an Arab-Mediterranean free trade zone to
facilitate the Euro-Mediterranean integration.
</P>
<P>
The Arab daily Alalam Alyoum reported Tuesday that the move
aims to further boost economic and trade cooperation and
facilitate the influx of investments.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member EU and 12 nations along the southern
Mediterranean basin, including the nine Arab states, established
Euro-Med Partnership in 1995 aimed at achieving a free trade zone
in Europe and the Mediterranean by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem -- Israel's short-term foreign debt has almost doubled
over the past two years compared to its level during the first six
years of this decade, the Bank of Israel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The debt totaled about 8.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 and the
first quarter of 1998, compared to 4.3 billion dollar between 1990
and 1996, the bank said. Most of the increase was due to rising
private-sector borrowing, currently accounting for some 80 percent
of the total short-term foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Secretary General of the Egyptian Chamber of Commerce,
Mohammed Al-Masry, said that they are planning to build a bridge
across the Aqaba Gulf to link Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the Arab
daily Alalam Alyoum reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With the new bridge, the travelers will not need to transit in
Jordan, Al-Masry said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The trade volume between Egypt and the U.S. in the
first four months this year has reached 1.2 billion dollars, the
Egyptian daily Alalam Alyoum reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Trade and Supply, Ahmed Gowaili, said Egypt exports
to the U.S. amounted to 226 million dollars and imports from the
country reached 965 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's unemployment rate rose to a new record
high of 8.8 percent in April. Since the beginning of this year,
the jobless rate has been rising steadily, from 8.3 percent in
January to 8.5 percent in February and 8.7 percent in March. The
annual unemployment rate in 1997 was 7.7 percent.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, wife of
visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton, inaugurated a medical center
for children in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai today.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the relationship between our two countries and our
two peoples has no more important objective than improving the
future for children of both our countries," Hillary said after
cutting ribbons for a U.S.-China joint venture medical center.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration ceremony is a separate program that the U.S.
first lady participated from those of President Clinton during
their first full-day stay in Shanghai, the third leg of their
9-day and 5-city visit to China.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Children's Medical Center is a cooperative project
between the Shanghai No. 2 University of Medical Sciences and
Project HOPE of the United States. It is the most comprehensive
and best equipped children's hospital in China.
</P>
<P>
Hillary said that the hospital is a successful example of
friendship and cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
"China's children are as beautiful, bright, intelligent as
those I saw in Xi'an, Beijing and Shanghai. I believe China will
surely have a bright future," she said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-China friendship and cooperation in the field of
medical and health care constitute an important part of friendly
cooperation between the two countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
After inaugurating the children's hospital, Hillary went to
Shanghai Women's Training Center to learn about training of
women for re-employment in the city. She attended classes of
tailoring and flower arrangement at the training center.
</P>
<P>
The training center has offered training courses for 3,000 laid
off female workers.
</P>
<P>
Hillary, a graduate of Wellesley College of the U.S., also paid
a visit to the only girls' school in Shanghai. She talked with

<HEADLINE> World's Thickest Loess Layer In China's Yellow River Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The world's thickest loess layer
is not, as scientists might have expected, on a mountainside, but
in fact in the valley of a local Yellow River section, a Chinese
geologist reports.
</P>
<P>
Associate Professor Hu Xiaohong, a geologist the the
Northwestern National Minorities College, said that exploration in
the village of Xijin, in the capital of China's Gansu Province,
revealed a loess layer there about 410 meters thick, the thickest
ever found.
</P>
<P>
According to Associate Prof. Hu, the layer was formed some 200
million years ago and will be useful for the study of climate
changes in the past.
</P>
<P>
Loess deposits formed under varied climate conditions have
diversified features, and the thickest loess layer is located
between the Mongolian Plateau and the Loess Plateau, he
acknowledged, saying that the Loess Plateau covers a total area of
400,000 sq.km, and the average thickness of its layer is 50-80 m.,
and so is the world's largest loess area.

<HEADLINE> HK Should Move into Hi-Tech: Scholar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- For future economic growth and
dynamism, Hong Kong should move from a services-oriented economy
into a hi-tech center, a Taiwan scholar said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Battered by the regional financial turmoil, Hong Kong has been
experiencing a painful economic adjustment. A growing number of
people inside and outside Hong Kong are rethinking about the
nature of economic activities in Hong Kong and the need to make
necessary changes, Yung Wei, president of Vanguard Institute for
Policy Studies, Taiwan, told a two-day Hong Kong Economic Forum
ended here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Foremost among the conclusions of the soul-searching efforts
concerning the structure of Hong Kong economy is that Hong Kong
must move from a service-oriented economy to that of hi-tech,"
Wei noted, who is also a professor of science at a Taiwan
university.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Hong Kong had a manufacturing industry which
constituted 21.9 percent of the total economy. Since then there
has been a steady decline of the industrial sector of Hong Kong
economy owing to the relocation of labor-intensive industries to
neighboring Pearl River Delta region.
</P>
<P>
By 1994, the manufacture sector of Hong Kong economy dwindled
to 7.2 percent. As a result, service sector has become the major
part of Hong Kong economy.
</P>
<P>
"With the upsurge of the Asian financial crisis, the
vulnerability of Hong Kong service-oriented economy has become
increasingly evident," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
A new avenue for future economic growth and dynamism "lies in
high technology, meaning information science and industry,
communication technology and bio-technology, to name just a few,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Hong Kong, a late comer in hi-tech
development, attract talent from both China's mainland and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Economic Forum, under the theme of "Free Market
Economy -- the Way Forward," was held just prior to the first
anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the forum were over 40 senior officials, think-tank
members and business leaders from Hong Kong and overseas,
according to Paul Yip, chairman of the Hong Kong Policy Research
Institute, which organized the forum together with the Hong Kong
Trade Development Council.
</P>
<P>
Topics covered Hong Kong as an international trade and
financial center, information and communications, human capital
development, the future of Hong Kong's industry, Asian values and
global partnership, the Asian economic crisis and the world
economy.

<HEADLINE> Peace, Good Governance Prerequisites for COMESA's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA)'s efforts will bear no fruits without
peace, political stability and democratic governance, Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba has said.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address Monday at the start of COMESA's third
summit in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Chiluba said civil strikes and the simmering political conflicts
between some of the COMESA member states were a cause of great
concern.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, the COMESA's Chairman, said that most of the
conflicts within and between states were due to factors which can
be resolved through discussion and have hampered the
organization's efforts to achieve sustainable economic
development and regional integration, the Malawi News Agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever their nature, the answer to them will not be found
in military confrontation. Guns will have the effect of
exacerbating the problems. Let us desist from war," said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Burundi, Malawi,
Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo, attended the one-day
summit whose theme is "information as a tool for increased trade
and investment in the COMESA."
</P>
<P>
COMESA exists to assist member states in achieving economic
recovery and sustainable growth and development.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president called on COMESA to speed up and deepen
social and economic ties between its member states to address the
causes of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
To deny people the political right to choose their own system
of government is undemocratic and as such, a condition which is a
recipe for political and social tension and conflicts, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that democratic government was vital for economic
development and regional integration.
</P>
<P>
On the theme of the summit, Chiluba said the successful
economies in the 21st century will be those that keep on adapting
to the continuous changes in technological systems.
</P>
<P>
"The investment and trade opportunities that abound in COMESA
can only be rationally and fully exploited through the
development of land based and satellite communications systems,"
Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
Laurent Kabila, President of the Democratic Republic of Congo
called on countries in Africa to reject what he said are attempts
by some elements to paint a bad picture of his country.
</P>
<P>
He urged COMESA countries to join hands with his nation,
saying his country is willing to place its vast natural resources
at the disposal of Africa and the COMESA.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on India's Response to Sino-U.S. Joint Statement on South Asia Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- It is the common wish for the
international community to require both India and Pakistan to put
an end to the nuclear arms race and ease the tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Tang Guoqiang made this
remark at a regular news conference here this afternoon. "We have
taken note of the different responses from India and Pakistan to
the Sino-U.S. joint statement on the South Asia situation signed
during U.S. President Clinton's China trip," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan reportedly expressed its welcome to the joint
statement, whereas India also voiced its own views on it, Tang
said.
</P>
<P>
Tang went on say that the joint Sino-U.S. statement was another
statement on the South Asia issue after one reached earlier during
the Geneva meeting by the foreign ministers of the Five Permanent
Members of the the United Nations Security Council .
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tang quoted the Sino-U.S. statement as saying that
"both China and the United States concern themselves with nuclear
tests by the two countries and the ensuing escalation of tension
that arises therefrom."
</P>
<P>
Also, both the Chinese and U.S. sides share common interests in
safeguarding peace and stability in the South Asia region and in
the powerful mechanism for global non-proliferation, Tang said,
They are resolved to increase their efforts for nuclear
non-proliferation, so as to help promote India-Pakistan
reconciliation and proceed to resolve the differences between
India and Pakistan through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
This conforms to the common aspiration of the international
community to oppose nuclear proliferation," Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Discusses Soccer World Cup With Shanghai Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton today discussed about the ongoing World Cup soccer
tournament with local fans, saying that the defending champion --
Brazil is the most possible winner.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about who he thinks will win the
soccer World Cup this time, President Clinton, who was attending a
live talk show at Radio Shanghai, said: "It's hard for me to
predict. I'm not an expert on soccer, but the Brazilians are
always hard to beat."
</P>
<P>
"I've watched them play a lot, and they're always very good,"
the president added. Brazil has won the Cup for four times, more
than any other nations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the U.S. national soccer team which lost to
the Iranians 1-2, leading to the elimination of the U.S. team from
the Cup, Clinton said the defeat was "heartbreaking for
Americans".
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that the Iranians "beat us fair and
square".
</P>
<P>
"The Iranians had two fast breaks and they played with such
passion when they had those two chances that they capitalized on
both of them and we respect that," said the president, who
obviously watched this game.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that this World Cup clash of soccer
teams would help improve the long-lasting tense relations between
the U.S. and Iran.
</P>
<P>
"It could be possible," he said when asked if this "football
diplomacy" could work.
</P>
<P>
"I think the World Cup is a great way of bringing people
together," he said.
</P>
<P>
At a round-table discussion with local residents at the
Shanghai Library earlier today, Clinton said that he would be glad
to have a teaching post in the prestigious Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that he has made no final plans for the years after
the end of his presidential term in two and a half years, Clinton
said that maybe he would apply for a visiting professorship in
Fudan.
</P>
<P>
Xie Xide, physicist and former president of Fudan, told the
U.S. president that he is more than welcome to be a visiting
professor in the university only on one condition, if he can speak
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
To which Clinton merrily answered, "I am not too old to learn."

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti, Pakistani Leaders Talks on Nuclear Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti and Pakistani leaders
opened talks here Tuesday on a wide-range of issues, especially
nuclear tension in South Asia, Kuwaiti official news agency Kuna
reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks was co-chaired by Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah and visiting
Pakistani Prime Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Kuna did not give details about of the talks, but local
newspapers reported earlier that they would focus on nuclear
tensions in South Asia, as well as ways of boosting bilateral
relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who arrived here Monday on a two-day official visit,
also met with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait sent a special envoy last month to Islamabad to express
solidarity with the Pakistani people after India conducted five
nuclear tests on May 11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, in response to the Indian tests, exploded six of its
own devices, which prompted foreign sanctions. Sharif then
launched a national self-reliance fund to fight the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Sharif visited the United Arab Emirates

<HEADLINE> Clinton on Live Radio Call-in Show in Shanghai (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- When Shanghai listeners tuned to
their loved radio program "Citizens and Society" at noon today,
their anchor man was exceptionally excited.
</P>
<P>
"We are excited to tell you my audience, we now have visiting
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi here as
specially invited guests, to whom you may call in to exchange
views on issues of Sino-U.S. relations and every thing of your
concern," the anchor man Zou Anlong announced.
</P>
<P>
The two invited guests were then seated in front of microphones
and ready for live broadcast. Being the city's first live radio
talk program, "Citizens and Society" debuted six years ago and
focuses on news and current events in Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and commercial center.
</P>
<P>
Since it was the first time for the show to have a foreign head
of state as a guest, its listeners started to jam the telephone
lines right after the anchor man's announcement.
</P>
<P>
The first caller was a foreign trade businessman, Mr. Fang, who
asked that against the background of the Southeast Asian financial
crisis what the United States and China should do to promote
bilateral trade and increase economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that people saw difficulties developing in
Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, the Republic of Korea and in
Japan, but "China has done a very good job in holding its currency
stable, in trying to be a force of stability during the Southeast
Asia crisis."
</P>
<P>
"We are working together, the United States and China, and we
are working through the IMF to try to help all these countries
stabilize their economies and then restore growth," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
More important, he stressed, that the Japanese government
should do more in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"The last point I'd like to make is that we cannot see growth
restored in Asia unless it is restored in Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Now, in Japan the people are about to have an election for the
upper house of the Diet, so this is not an easy time for them. But
the government is going to disclose in the next couple of days
what it intends to do in the area of financial reform, according
to the President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"We are working hard on it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The caller responded, "that's right, everybody should know that
we've been working so hard."
</P>
<P>
Right after arriving at the studio, President Clinton said to
the anchor man that he was a bit "nervous," because this was also
the first time for him to be in a foreign radio program to
communicate with the local people on air, though he was used to
such programs inside the United States as an experienced
politician.

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a question on China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Clinton said it is important for China to be a
member of WTO because China is a major economic power that will
grow only larger over time.
</P>
<P>
"We in the United States want to support China's economic
growth. After all, we are by far the largest purchaser of Chinese
exports," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do in America is... China should be in
the World Trade Organization, but it has to be a commercially
realistic set of understanding when you have memberships," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll reach an agreement before long," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to more educational and cultural exchanges, the
president expressed the hope that more Chinese students can go to
the United States and more American youths come to study in China.
</P>
<P>
There is a broad field for Shanghai and the U.S. to strengthen
cooperation and exchange, Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi agreed to the view.
</P>
<P>
During the 50-minute radio program, six citizens talked with
Clinton and the Shanghai mayor, covering areas of the economy,
trade, education, environmental protection and sports in a frank
and friendly atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
After the call-in show, Clinton said that he was satisfied with
the activity, adding that the citizens in Shanghai raised very
good questions.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Vows to Fight Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada, in his inaugural speech, on Tuesday reiterated that his
government will give priority to poverty alleviation, food
security for the poor, and the restoration of peace and order in
the country.
</P>
<P>
"We will educate their children and foster their health. We
will bring peace and security, jobs and dignity to the law," said
Estrada at a grand rally in down Manila.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who was sworn in at noon Tuesday, also promised to
provide "a roof over the heads of the poor, food on their tables
and clothes on their backs."
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who won the May 11 presidential polls on a populist
pro-poor platform, said the era of the Filipino masses has arrived
with his election as president.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who had been vice president since 1992, has vowed to
cut the country's current 34 percent poverty incidence to 20
percent within his six-year term.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to speed up the improvement of the living
conditions of the common people, time for them to have a fairer
share of the national wealth they create and a bigger stake in
their own country," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, a former action movie star famous for playing Robin
Hood-style heroes fighting for the poor, also vowed to crack down
on rampant criminal syndicates in the country.
</P>
<P>
Estrada took time to laud former President Fidel Ramos for
laying the foundation of a strong economy, which has sustained
significant growth for years.
</P>
<P>
The new president admitted that his immediate challenge will be
the currency crisis-battered economy. But he did not elevate his
economic policies.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Alleviation Priority in Malawian Economy: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Malawian government has noted
that poverty alleviation remains the center-piece of its economic
program.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Cassim Chilumpha made the remarks when he
presented the country's 1998/99 budget in parliament in Malawi's
capital Lilongwe, the Malawi News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He presented a 631.3-million-US-Dollar budget for the 1998/99
financial year, of which 381 million Dollars has been earmarked
for recurrent expenditure and 251 million Dollars for development
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Of the 251-million-Dollar development expenditure, Chilumpha
said, only 25 million Dollars will come from local resources
while 216 million Dollars will be funded from foreign loans and
grants.
</P>
<P>
"Government has made deliberate allocations in favor of
priority sectors like education, health, agriculture, works,
water development and forestry," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If these important areas are improved, we believe poverty
among our people now will be eradicated," Chilumpha added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said government has placed "special emphasis" on
effective expenditure control and prudent financial management to
avoid unnecessary over-expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the government overspent by 24 million Dollars
has raised some eyebrows within international lending
institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank as to how the over expenditure came about when a "cash
budget system" was in place.
</P>
<P>
But Chilumpha contended that some unforeseen natural
occurrences compounded by some fiscal indiscipline among
controlling officers contributed to the over-expenditure.
</P>
<P>
"This year's budget will therefore, aim at consolidating
structural reforms and expenditure priorities vital for
socio-economic progress.
</P>
<P>
"In 1997/98 fiscal year, there was a 10 percent overall budget
deficit" because of "financing pressure on budget, due to imports
of maize and relief operations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rose from one percent in 1996 to 20.2 percent in
1997. But Chilumpha was optimistic that with sound economic
measures now in place inflation rate will drop to 10 percent by
December this year.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the country expects agriculture output to
grow by 4.7 percent in 1998 with small scale farming contributing
a leading 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Maize production is expected to increase by 25 percent to 1.76
million metric tons and manufacturing by 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern that tobacco exports, the country's
largest foreign exchange earner, will continue showing signs of
decline with average prices falling to 29 percent in the current
trend.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced customs and excise measures to
enhance trade liberalization and stimulate production which
include: reduction in maximum duty rates from 40 percent to 30
percent, and industrial machines' rates from 15 percent to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Also included are designated raw materials and intermediate
goods which will be reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent, and 10
to 5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to Chilumpha, "overall budget reflects government's
determination to improve the lives of people and also propel the
Malawian economy into the next millennium with rapid growth and
rising social welfare."

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A new map, a result of 30 years
of study into Antarctic rocks by Australian and Russian experts,
has been produced, giving a glimpse into how Australia was formed
500 million years ago, Australian Resources and Energy Minister
Warwick Parer said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian Geological Survey Organization has produced a
special map based on 30 years of research by Russian and
Australian scientists... providing a window into the formation of
Gondwana," Parer said at the launch of the map.
</P>
<P>
Gondwana was the name for the world land mass that originally
linked Australia to Asia and Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
"Special focus of attention for the Russian and Australian
scientists has been the world's largest glacier, the Lambert
Glacier in Prydz Bay in the Antarctic," Parer said.
</P>
<P>
"The rocks exposed in the Prince Charles Mountains along its
side provide a window into the formation of Gondwana 500 million
years ago, and the early history of the Earth 3.2 billion years
ago."
</P>
<P>
The map encapsulated Russian geology and geophysics as well as
Australian results, and is able to be updated regularly, the
minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Stock Market lost
ground Tuesday despite the government announced Monday a package
of off-budget measures to bolster the economy.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) lost 18.49
points to close at 1,066.66 points.
</P>
<P>
The total volume was 122.19 million shares, valued at 251.40
million Singapore dollars (about 148.76 million U.S. dollars).
Losers led gainers by 154 to 95 with 339 stocks remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The most active stock was SingTel which had 10.28 million
shares traded. It was followed by Easyknit thk which had 7.37
million units traded. DBS Land was next with 6.38 million shares
changing hands.
</P>
<P>

close at 1.00 U.S. dollar. RothmansI was 25 cents up to close at
7.50 Singapore dollars. CityDev gained 24 cents to end at 4.72
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Venture w99 was the biggest lower as it shed
80 cents to finish at 2.10 Singapore dollars. SPH was 70 cents
down to end at 11.30 Singapore dollars. Venture was next as it
fell by 36 cents to close at 3.20 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the fall indicated that the much anticipated
off-budget measures failed to lift market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said although the package provided measures to reduce
corporate costs and control supply in the property market, it
failed to offer much to spur demand.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Soldiers Guard Hydro Power Plant Against Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A company of soldiers from the
Fiji Military Forces Tuesday would take over security operations
at the country's main hydro power station with orders to shoot
trespassers, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Monasavu Hydroelectric installation in the mountains of
Viti Levu, the country's main island, was the target of an arson
attack over the weekend that caused Fiji Prime Minister Sitiveni
Rabuka to cut short a visit to Australia to deal with the crisis,
the AAP reported from Suva, capital of Fiji.
</P>
<P>
Fiji Minister for Home Affairs Colonel Paul Manueli said
Tuesday that the soldiers had been told to use firearms if needed,
the wire service said.
</P>
<P>
Trouble started brewing in the area around the installation
over the weekend as an office block was destroyed by fire on
Sunday after the government ignored a demand by landowners last
week for 35 million Fiji dollars (17 million U.S. dollars) in
compensation for their land.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are continuing into the blaze and no arrests
have been made, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Col. Manueli, a former commander of the Fiji army, said more
than 100 soldiers would take over the security of the
hydroelectric installation from police later Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been about 100 policemen deployed over the
past week in the area, 80 kilometers northwest of Suva.
</P>
<P>
He added that the soldiers would remain in the area as long as
they were required.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a special cabinet sub-committee has been appointed
to look into the landowners' demands and make recommendations next
month.

<HEADLINE> Giant Flight Kitchen To Open at New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- One of the world's largest
flight kitchens will start operation on July 6 this year, the same
day the Hong Kong new airport at Chek Lap Kok opens for commercial
aviation.
</P>
<P>
Located on the southeast corner of Chek Lap Kok, the
three-story catering facility has a gross floor area of 50,400
square meters, ranking third in the world, according to Paul
Stuart, project manager of Cathay Pacific Catering Services
(CPCS), the company that operates the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
The new building houses a complex production line capable of
handling 80,000 flight meals per day, putting it among the top
five around the globe. But Stuart said Tuesday that the facility
would turn out some 40,000 meals per day at opening as the demand
shrank in the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
A 3.3-km-long conveyor belt within the building transports
goods and trays, similar to a car assembly line. There are also a
320-meter-long bank of washing machines and a 500-meter-long
vacuum waste system.
</P>
<P>
A computer-controlled system enables automatic dispatch and
retrieval of goods and carts, creating a high degree of
efficiency, said the project manager.
</P>
<P>
It took two years to construct the catering facility at a cost
of 1.6 billion HK dollars (200 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
CPCS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hong Kong's flagship
airline, Cathay Pacific Airways, now operates at Kai Tak Airport a
flight kitchen. It produces an average of 35,000 meals a day for
35 airlines, taking a 70 percent market share for airline catering
services in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On July 5 night, CPCS will take part in the dramatic overnight
relocation of facilities from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok. It will
transfer 70,000 trays, 40,000 glasses, 70,000 sets of utensils,
and 2,000 meal carts in 90 six-meter-long containers, and almost
100 catering vehicles such as refrigerated trucks and
high-loaders.
</P>
<P>
"All the load will have to be in place when the new airport
opens on July 6," said Stuart.

<HEADLINE> Four Million Afghan Refugees Return Home Since 1988: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The four millionth Afghan refugee
has recently returned home while 2.6 million remain in exile, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
For much of the 1980s, Afghan refugees accounted for almost
half of the world's total and, by the end of the decade, the
number of refugees peaked at 6.2 million, said the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, more than 2.7 million Afghans have returned from
Pakistan and 1.3 million from Iran. There are still around 1.4
million refugees living in Iran and 1.2 million in Pakistan, with
hundreds of thousands more scattered across the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"This staggering number of returnees is a record for any
refugee group since World War II," said UNHCR chief Sadako
Ogata. "Tragically, Afghanistan also still holds the record as
UNHCR's largest single refugee case load in the world for the 18th
year in succession, around 2.6 million at present."
</P>
<P>
Despite the achievements in refugee repatriation, UNHCR said
that it is struggling to raise funds for the continued
repatriation and reintegration of Afghan refugees.
</P>
<P>
With more than half the year gone, the agency only has 4.5
million U.S. dollars available out of its original projected 1998
budget of 21 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR officials warned that if funds continued to remain in
short supply, many refugees who would like to return might be
deterred from doing so since the agency would be unable to carry
out vital rehabilitation work in their home areas.

<HEADLINE> Maldives President to Visit Pakistan Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 30 (Xinhua) -- President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom
of the Maldives is paying an official visit to Pakistan on July
1-2 in his capacity as Chairman of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC), said an official press release
issued on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Qayoom will hold formal talks with
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Rafiq Tarar,
the release said.
</P>
<P>
Official talks between Qayoom and Sharif will cover matters
relating to regional cooperation under SAARC as well as the whole
gamut of Pakistan-Maldives bilateral relations, it said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will consider ways and means to consolidate and
further expand relations between the two countries, it added.
</P>
<P>
Gayoom's visit to Pakistan is in keeping with SAARC tradition,
whereby a head of state or government before the end of his tenure
as chairman undertakes visits to SAARC member states to apprise
them of the activities of the association under his chairmanship.
He has so far visited Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and
India.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Wrecks Havoc in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Floods and diseases brought
about by El Nino created widespread havoc in Tanzania, killing
416 people and affecting 2.4 million others,, an official has
said here.
</P>
<P>
The floods resulted from El Nino from last October to May this
year have also destroyed 37,615 houses and 221,945 hectares of
crops, Kingunge Ngombale-Mwiru, the Minister of State in the
Prime Minister's Office said Monday while addressing parliament,
known as the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Other effects caused by El Nino include eruption of contagious
diseases like cholera, dysentery, crop and animal diseases, as
well as breeding of rodents and green hoppers, the official was
quoted by Tuesday's newspaper The Guardian as saying.
</P>
<P>
The floods have also played havoc with roads, bridges and
railways, he said, adding that international community have
agreed to donate 35.3 billion Shillings (about 53.6 million U.S.
Dollars) to Tanzania for repairing major roads and bridges in
various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, the World Bank will disburse 39.9 million U.S.
Dollars as its general contribution and another 11.68 million
U.S. Dollars for emergency rehabilitation of major roads.
</P>
<P>
He told the National Assembly that Britain will also
contribute 1.3 billion Shillings (about 1.97 million U.S.
Dollars) for rehabilitation of bridges in selected roads in the
country.
</P>
<P>
So far, the government has appropriated 2.4 billion Shillings
(about 3.64 million U.S. Dollars) to the Road Fund for emergency
road repair, 63.3 million Shillings (about 96,000 U.S. Dollars)
on rehabilitation of airports and 11.8 billion Shillings (about
1.79 million U.S. Dollars) have been allocated in the 1998/99
financial year to deal with El Nino effects, Ngombale-Mwiru said.
</P>
<P>
The short-term program to rehabilitate the infrastructure as a
result of El Nino is estimated to cost 189 million U.S. Dollars
whereas long-term measures will cost 163 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last month, presidents of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda met in
north Tanzania's Arusha, appealing to donors to assist the three
countries in building and repairing road network.
</P>
<P>
The donor community has promised to grant the three countries
more than one billion U.S. Dollars for the first phase of the
scheme.

<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's

</P>
<P>
The visit has expanded the exchanges and cooperation between
the two sides in a wide range of fields, increased the American

<P>
The leaders of both nations underlined that improvement and

<HEADLINE> Japan to Lift Travel Warning for Lima </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto told Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori Tuesday that
Japan is considering lifting a travel advisory warning against
Japanese tourists visiting Lima.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, in a meeting with Fujimori, said that Japan will
withdraw the warning after an evaluation of the security
conditions there is made, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The warning was posted 10 days after a group of Peruvian
leftist guerrillas stormed the Japanese ambassador's residence in
the Peruvian capital on December 17, 1996 and took hundreds
hostage.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government has been seeking to relax the Japanese
advisory to help spur the country's tourism industry since Peru
resolved the hostage crisis by using force on April 22, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori arrived here Sunday for a four-day visit to attend an
international symposium, which was opened by Hashimoto earlier in
the day, to promote economic exchange between Japan and countries
in Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto and Fujimori were joined in their meeting by
Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti, during which the
three leaders briefly discussed the generally good health of the
Latin American economy in contrast to Japan's sluggish business
outlook, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Scales Down Revenue Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Following the economic downturn
caused by the on-going currency crisis, the Philippine government
has scaled down its total revenue target from 527 billion pesos
(13.1 billion U.S. dollars) to 488 billion pesos (12.2 billion
dollars) for this year.
</P>
<P>
In a transition report published here Tuesday, out-going
Finance Secretary Salvador Enriquez said that the revenue target
of the Bureau of Internal Revenue has been downscaled to 367
billion pesos (9.1 billion dollars) for 1998, instead of the
original projection of 378 billion pesos (9.4 billion dollars)
because of the slowdown of the economic growth in the country.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, he said, the revenue target of the Bureau of Customs
for this year has been reduced to 83.6 billion pesos (2 billion
dollars) instead of the original target of 123.6 billion pesos (3
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
To achieve the revised target, the secretary said, the new
government of President Joseph Estrada must continue with tax
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was sworn in Tuesday as the new president to replace
Fidel Ramos.

<HEADLINE> Experts Worry over Increased Drug Trade in W. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- As the world marked this year's
international day against drug trafficking and abuse at the
weekend, experts have expressed concern over the alarming
increase of drug trade in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the African Council of Narcotics (ACON)
Tuesday attributed the major factors for the increased drug trade
in the sub-region to the "very tricky" drug traffickers,
especially Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
"They evolve newer and more sophisticated methods and
strategies to move their consignment" to consuming nations of
America and Europe, it said.
</P>
<P>
Other factors that make it easier for the drug trade to
increasingly flourish in the sub-region, noted ACON President
Deacon Bassey Rekpene, include "very porous borders, poor control
of the vast land, air and waterways of the region."
</P>
<P>
He also cited as worsening the problem "corrupt law
enforcement officers, many of whom are only too willing to look
the other way for fat tips and lack of equipment and skilled
manpower for effective movement of drugs."
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) treaty,
which allows free movement of persons and goods within the
sub-region is now being abused and used for drug trafficking,
according to him.
</P>
<P>
"Nigerian or Ghanaian traffickers drop their international
passports in Abidjan or Banjul from where they move cocaine or
heroin to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Benin, Burkina Faso or Lagos
with their ECOWAS traveling certificates for onward
transshipment," he said.
</P>
<P>
West African traffickers now transship cocaine from south
America and heroin from Asia to the United States, Canada and
continue in Europe through Cape Verde, Equatorial Guinea,
Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, Benin, Togo and Ghana mostly.
</P>
<P>
The civil wars in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea Bissau, and
political tensions among countries of the sub-region escalated
the social problem of drug abuse, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the ACON president blamed the problem of cultivation
and production of Indian hemp, the predominant drug of the
sub-region, on poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Majority of the countries within west Africa fall in the
category of least-developed countries with per capita income
ranging from less than 100 to 1,000 U.S. Dollars a year, with
gross domestic product of not up to 1,000 Dollars," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Urges Int'l Help to Address Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Help from the international
community is needed to address the current economic crisis as the
prosperity and well-being of Southeast and East Asia are very
important to the world, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Actions of each nation affect other nations as never before,"
Rubin said during his speech at the renowned Chularlongkorn
University Tuesday noon.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, every nation has the responsibility to help address
the problems faced by other nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that during the current economic turmoil in the
region, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) lent a hand to the affected
nations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States and Japan jointly intervened in
the money market when the Japanese yen plummeted to a record-low
level in nearly eight years.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested nations affected by the crisis strengthen
their financial sectors, increase government transparency and let
the financial institutions shoulder greater responsibility for
their own activities.
</P>
<P>
As for Japan, Rubin said the United States is "deeply
concerned" about the weaknesses of the Japanese economy, which is
critical to the economic health of the region and the world as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the recent fiscal stimulus policies of the Japanese
government, hailing them as the "first step forward."
</P>
<P>
When talking about China that he had just visited as a member
of President Bill Clinton's entourage, Rubin said China's success
is important to the world.
</P>
<P>
China's strong commitment to maintaining its foreign exchange
rate is "a source of stability" of the region and the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin arrived here on Monday as part of a four-nation tour in
Asia, which has taken him to China and Malaysia and will also take
him to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai earlier
Tuesday, Rubin hailed the progress the government has achieved,
saying it has adopted "sound policies".
</P>
<P>
Rubin affirmed that his country supports additional IMF funding
to Thailand if needed.

<HEADLINE> 60 S. Leonean Rebels Die in Canoe Mishap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- About 60 supporters of Sierra
Leone's ousted junta, including rebels of the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF), drowned at the weekend in a canoe mishap in
the east of the country, a report reaching here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place Saturday when canoes crossing the Moa
River in the Kailahun district struck rocks and capsized, the
report said, quoting a Catholic relief organization.
</P>
<P>
It is thought the junta supporters were trying to line up with
comrades.
</P>
<P>
Last week, fishermen pulled five bodies from the Moa River,
which were also identified as rebels.
</P>
<P>
The junta, which seized power after overthrowing the elected
civilian government in a coup in May last year, was ousted by the
west African peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG this February.
</P>
<P>
The remnants of the junta, as well as those of its allied RUF
rebels, escaped for guerrilla war in the north and east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is stepping up its efforts in a mopping up exercise in
order to wipe them out completely in an early date.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rise for 5th Straight Day in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher in Tokyo
on Tuesday for the fifth consecutive trading day as the Japanese
yen's firm resistance against the U.S. dollar encouraged both
institutional investors and speculators.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section at the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped 464.54 points, or 3.02
percent, from Monday's close to finish at 15,830.27.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 28.16 points or 2.34 percent to
1,230.38.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, was the day's
most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 520
million shares from Monday's 398.83 million.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rose across the board, even in recession-hit sectors
such as construction, machinery and steel, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei's five-day winning streak is its longest since
mid-January, when it closed higher for six consecutive trading
days. The index has now gained more than 770 points since last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar sank to 140 yen during the afternoon trading in
Tokyo amid rumors of a future joint intervention by Japan, the
United States and China to buy the yen.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the rumors, along with more signs that Japan will
unveil a solution for its bad loan mess by Thursday, helped bring
foreign investors back to the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,333 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
outweighed losers 1,041 to 137.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Assistance For Water Plant In Southwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Work began on a large water plant
being built with Japanese government loans began over the weekend
on the western outskirts of Guiyang, the capital city of Guizhou
Province with 1.2 million residents and an industrial center in
southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 1.07 billion yuan (129 million US
dollars), 319 million (38.4 million US dollars) of which will be
covered by 5.5 billion yen worth of Japanese loans transferred
through the Export-Import Bank, local sources say.
</P>
<P>
Guiyang now has five waterworks, with a combined daily water
capacity of 480,000 cu.m., but this has fallen far short of local
industrial production and individual needs because of rapid
economic and population growth.
</P>
<P>
The new water plant will have a designed daily capacity of
400,000 tons and will include transport, purification, and
distribution facilities.
</P>
<P>
The entire project will take four years to complete. By the
year 2001, the daily capacity of Guiyang Water Supply Corporation
will double, thus greatly helping ease the city's supply problems,
local officials said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Joins Roundtable Discussion with Shanghai Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton and his wife Hillary had a roundtable discussion with
Shanghai citizens here today.
</P>
<P>
In the discussion themed "shaping China for the 21st century,"
the Clintons inquired about changes in all aspects of China's
society in the past two decades through talks with people from the
legal, educational, academic, cultural and art and religious
circles of the municipality.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton said that the discussion will help him and
the American people to better understand the changes that are
going on in China.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions from the Clintons, the Shanghai citizens
attending the discussion briefed them about changes that had taken
place in their respective working units and their own personal
lives over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
They said that in these years, China has seen rapid economic
growth and continuous improvement of the living standards of the
people. They said that China has kept opening to the rest of the
world, with rapid economic growth and continued improvement in the
people's living standards. They expressed the hope that China and
the U.S. and their people will further increase contact and
exchanges and that the U.S. will play an active role in China's
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions about U.S.-China cooperation in science and
technology, Clinton said that this area was probably the most
successful part of the U.S.-China cooperation in the past few
years, adding that scientists of the two countries have achieved
significant results in their cooperation in such fields as medical
science and earthquake forecasting.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to do more of that," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of U.S. restriction on technology export to China,
Clinton said that the United States and China have been
implementing an agreement on peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
"I personally believe that the most important cooperation of
science and technology between the United States and China should
be on the energy side.
</P>
<P>
"I already have spoken to President Jiang Zemin that the focus
of our scientific and technological cooperation in the future
should be on the relations between energy utilization and
environment protection because this is the biggest challenge that
both countries will face," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are working to resolve the issue of transferring
technologies involving the so-called national security," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the same problem does not exist in the
aspect of transferring technologies of energy and environmental
protection to China, the U.S. will export more of these
technologies to China.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Joins COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has officially joined the
Common Markets for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) as COMESA
leaders endorsed its membership at their third summit Monday in
Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Host President Laurent Kabila and his five counterparts --
Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Sam Nujoma
of Namibia, Bakili Muluzi of Malawi, Frederick Chiluba of Zambia
and Pierre Buyoya of Burundi attended the one-day meeting, the
East African Standard reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Also present were Uganda's First Deputy Prime Minister Eriya
Kategaya and a senior minister from Swaziland. At the summit,
Kabila replaced Chiluba as the new rotating COMESA chairman.
</P>
<P>
Issues like free trade, transport, communications and
investment are high on the agenda at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Kabila called for closer economic cooperation among African
nations in order to foster a stronger regional body.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba told the summit that unless African countries strive
to be export oriented rather than producers of raw materials,
they risked being marginalized by the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
COMESA's acting Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha said the
group's member states are confronted with a huge debt burden.
</P>
<P>
"Worse still our region is in dire need for investment
resources for infrastructure, the productive sector, education,
health... It is estimated that on an annual basis, COMESA region
will require in excess 50 billion U.S. Dollars for investment,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1994, COMESA groups 19 African states, which have
agreed to promote regional integration through trade development
and common markets. The region has a potential market of over
300 million people.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Presidents of Kenya and Burundi held talks over the
peace process in and the economic sanctions imposed on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Moi also held separate bilateral talks with
Nujoma and Kabila. Moi is set to come back Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- What Hong Kong has undergone over
the past year since China resumed the exercise of its Sovereignty
over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997 has fully testified to the
correctness of the great theory of "One Country, Two Systems" put
forward by Deng Xiaoping, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang at the press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The general situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) is good, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The original social system and the living ways of the residents
have not changed, and the law remains basically unchanged, he
added, pointing out that Hong Kong people have continued to enjoy
various rights and freedom.
</P>
<P>
He praised the SAR government led by chief executive Tung
Chee-hwa for its outstanding efforts in helping Hong Kong
withstand the east Asian financial crisis and maintain its status
as a global financial and trade center.
</P>
<P>
With a sound economic basis and strength, Tang believed, Hong
Kong will soon walk out of the difficulties given the combined
efforts of the SAR government and local residents and with the
assistance of the Chinese mainland. enditem

<HEADLINE> New Philippine Cabinet Sworn Into Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
swore into office his 22-member cabinet here hours after he was
inaugurated the country's 13th president at noon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who has vowed to crack down on rampant criminal
syndicates in the country, proclaimed himself concurrent secretary
of the Interior and Local Government.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the former ruling
Lakas-NUCD (National Union of Christian Democrats) party was named
to head the Department of Social Welfare and Development.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's cabinet was headed by Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora, former member of the House of Representatives and a close
aide of Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Banker Edgardo Espiritu was appointed finance secretary and
former senator Orlando Mercado, former chairman of the Senate
Defense Committee, was designated defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
Three cabinet members of the former government retained their
posts. They are Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon, Public
Works and Highways Secretary Gregorio Vigilar, and Science and
Technology Secretary William Padolina.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old Estrada, former action movie star, was sworn in
at Barasoain Church in Malolos city near Manila to succeed former
President Fidel Ramos. He will deliver his inaugural speech late
Tuesday afternoon in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who was elected president in the 1992 elections, was
banned from running for re-election after his
constitutionally-mandated single six-year term expired at noon
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who emerged a runaway winner in the May 11
presidential polls, has promised to give priority to fighting
poverty, guaranteeing food security, revitalizing agricultural
sector, and restoring peace and order in the country.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Proposes Joint Sub Incident Probe With Pyongyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
Tuesday directed his cabinet to propose a joint investigation with
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) into the latter's
submarine incident.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said the joint investigation proposed by
the president is designed to identify the cause of the incident.
</P>
<P>
The directive came from the president after the DPRK accused
South Korea of being inhuman in treating the incident which
claimed lives of the nine crewmen inside the submarine.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the DPRK urged South Korea to return the
submarine and the corpses of the crewmen and condemned Seoul's
description of the submarine incident as being on an espionage
mission.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK also asked South Korea to shoulder the responsibility
for the death of the nine crewmen as it failed to take
humanitarian action to rescue the submarine and its crewmen.
</P>
<P>
On June 22, a DPRK submarine was caught by the South Korean
Navy after it was spotted entangled in a fishing dragnet in the
East Sea (Sea of Japan), some 18 kilometers off the South Korean
city of Solcho.
</P>
<P>
All nine crewmen aboard were found shot to death or committed
suicide when the submarine was opened four days later.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean military authorities said the DPRK sub
incident "on an espionage mission" was a clear violation of South
Korean waters against the Armistice Agreement signed in 1953 and
the South-North basic relations agreement reached in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK, however, claimed that the vessel strayed off course
from engine troubles during a routine military exercise.

<HEADLINE> S. African Banks Raise Rates Amid Rand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Fears that South Africa
faced an economic disaster resurfaced Monday after three major
banks raised their prime overdraft rates by two percentage
points, national newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By Monday evening, First National Bank, Standard Bank and
Nedcor had announced increases in their prime rates to 22.25
percent, but kept mortgage rates unchanged for the time being at
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The hikes followed Monday's rise in the Reserve Bank's repo
rate, the rate at which it lends to banks, to 20.08 percent from
Friday's 18.31 percent in a bid to protect the Rand.
</P>
<P>
The raising of interest rates is a bitter blow to the
government's plans to provide a better life for the country's
poor, as increased lending rates stifle borrowing and growth.
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning the Rand again crashed to record lows
against the major currencies.
</P>
<P>
Shell-shocked traders watched as the currency plummeted,
hitting 6.17 to the U.S. Dollar before subsiding to 5.92 Rand at
the end of the day. The Rand has lost almost 22 percent its value
this year and 7.5 percent in the past week.
</P>
<P>
Against the British Pound, it closed at 9.83 after breaking
the 10 Rand barrier in early trading.
</P>
<P>
The stock exchange and the bond market took a hammering as the
Rand weakened, with financial shares shedding 3.8 percent as
interest rates jitters gripped the markets.
</P>
<P>
If prolonged, the high interest rates could virtually wipe out
economic growth this year and eat a huge chunk out of next year's
growth rate, which was expected to be robust, economists said.
</P>
<P>
They now put growth at about one percent or less for this year
and at two to three percent for next year, down from initial
expectations of about two percent this year and three to four
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
However, government officials tried to put a brave face on
things, emphasizing the positive effects of a weak Rand on the
balance of payments and expressing hope that the situation would
be reversed in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry Director-General Maria Ramos acknowledged
that government's economic growth rate estimate of three percent
for the fiscal year, on which the budget was based, was under
threat.
</P>
<P>
"We will take stock of things and do the number once calm has
returned to the markets. There is a need for a longer-term
perspective," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
The weaker Rand has pushed up the Rand price of gold, and the
country's gold mines, which were recently contemplating closures
and massive layoffs, are now expected to turn in good
performance.
</P>
<P>
The plunging currency has also made South Africa a cheap
destination for tourists.
</P>
<P>
An economist said the depressing effects of high interest
rates would be moderated by the stimulus to exports from a weak
Rand. "The rise in rates will ensure the competitive advantage of
a weak Rand is not eroded by inflation."
</P>
<P>
But others said the country could not expect too much from
exports, with demand drying up in Asia and Africa and commodity
prices falling.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Discusses Soccer World Cup With Shanghai Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton today discussed about the ongoing World Cup soccer
tournament with local fans, saying that the defending champion --
Brazil is the most possible winner.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about who he thinks will win the
soccer World Cup this time, President Clinton, who was attending a
live talk show at Radio Shanghai, said: "It's hard for me to
predict. I'm not an expert on soccer, but the Brazilians are
always hard to beat."
</P>
<P>
"I've watched them play a lot, and they're always very good,"
the president added. Brazil has won the Cup for four times, more
than any other nations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the U.S. national soccer team which lost to
the Iranians 1-2, leading to the elimination of the U.S. team
from the Cup, Clinton said the defeat was "heartbreaking for
Americans".
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that the Iranians "beat us fair and
square".
</P>
<P>
"The Iranians had two fast breaks and they played with such
passion when they had those two chances that they capitalized on
both of them and we respect that," said the president, who
obviously watched this game.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that this World Cup clash of soccer
teams would help improve the long-lasting tense relations between
the U.S. and Iran.
</P>
<P>
"It could be possible," he said when asked if this "football
diplomacy" could work.
</P>
<P>
"I think the World Cup is a great way of bringing people
together," he said.

<HEADLINE> Rising Tea Prices to Boost Malawi Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Malawi beleaguered economy could
get some help from rising world tea prices resulting from
decreased production of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Currently Malawi tea can fetch 1.48 U.S. Dollars per kilogram
compared to 0.99 Dollars in 1997 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Netherlands have found that Malawi tea is a
good substitute for that of Kenya, the tea production of which
has been hit by a severe drought.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 Malawi produced 43,900 tons of tea, 18 percent higher
than 1996.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary forecasts put this year's output at 44,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
World consumption is expected to increase until the end of the
decade, and prices for Malawi tea are likely to continue firming.
</P>
<P>
Tea is Malawi's second biggest foreign exchange earner. Its
main export of tobacco is suffering from very low prices.
</P>
<P>
Tea exports earned the country 44 million Dollars in 1997
compared with 20 million Dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Africa Economic Growth Falls: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Africa's economy expanded by 3.7
percent last year, lower than the growth rate of five percent in
the previous year, a survey reaching here says.
</P>
<P>
However, economies in certain African countries grew faster,
the East African Standard newspaper Tuesday quoted the survey as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
Uganda again set the pace with seven percent expansion while
Cameroun, Cote d'Ivoire, Sudan and Tunisia had their economies
growing by between five to six percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey from the Worldwatch Institute,
Africa's economic growth rate is much lower than Asia's which
reached 7.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the world economy expanded from 28 trillion U.S.
Dollars in 1996 to 29.1 trillion Dollars last year, up by 4.1
percent and marking the fourth consecutive year of growth at four
percent or more.
</P>
<P>
The south Asian sub-continent, led by India with a growth rate
of 6.6 percent, racked up an overall growth of roughly six
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Economy in advanced industrial countries expanded at three
percent last year. The United States and Canada led the major
industrial states with growth in their economies of 3.7 percent
each.
</P>
<P>
The world trade increased by 4.4 percent to 5.9 trillion
Dollars last year when exports by developing countries grew at
6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The proportion that included exports of minerals and
agricultural items (primary products) from the third world
declined precipitously from 80 percent in 1980 to 40 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, manufactured goods as a proportion of
developing nations' exports shot up from 20 to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trade trends are still dominated by the United States, Japan
and the European Union, but the World Bank projects that in
future they will be set by the "big five" developing nations --
China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The five account for more than half of the world's population,
but only nine percent of world's exports. This share will explode
to 25-40 percent by 2020, the World Bank predicts.

<HEADLINE> France to Strengthen Ties with Angola: Chirac </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French President Jacques
Chirac has said that the aim of his current visit is to
strengthen bilateral ties so as to expand their future
cooperations.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the remarks here on Monday night at a banquet
hosted by Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos in his honor.
</P>
<P>
France and Angola have been enjoying friendly cooperative
relations in the traditional sphere, he said, adding cooperation
in areas such as economic development in the rural regions and
personnel training should be further broadened so that Angola
could play its due role in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Chirac, France has rich experience in
Agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery, industry and trade, and
wishes to exchange these experiences with Angola to promote
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos said in his speech that France has forged fruitful
relations with Angola in the past two decades regardless the
warring state in the southern African country, providing precious
aids especially in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that France will continue in its help to Angola to
ensure the success of its efforts in national security, economic
stability and exploration of resources.
</P>
<P>
Angola has benefited a lot from its collaboration with
France's Elf Aquitaine and Total oil companies, said dos Santos,
adding that he believed the two countries will establish an
economic partnership of real equality on this basis.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived in the Angolan capital on Monday for a two-day
visit at the invitation of dos Santos. This is the first visit
ever by a French president. During the visit, the two countries
will sign a number of cooperation agreements.

<HEADLINE> Laser Operation Helps Hirsute Chinese Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A 17-year-old Chinese girl with
excess body hair had the hair on many parts of her face removed
Wednesday by Shanghai doctors who used a U.S. laser device in the
first hair-removal operation of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The girl, Liu Hua, who is from China's Liaoning Province in the
Northeast, could hardly believe her eyes when she touched her
smooth face after the operation and said, "My beautiful dream has
finally come true after more than a dozen years."
</P>
<P>
This was the second operation for her. It was done by doctors
at the Shanghai No.2 Medical Science University's No.9 Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The first operation was for removing hair on lower part of her
face and she will return to Shanghai for her final treatment in
two months' time.
</P>
<P>
The laser method usually requires three or four treatments to
totally destroy the hair follicles to keep the hair from ever
reappearing.

<HEADLINE> China Remains Largest Potential Market On Earth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Wang Yuncai, Yan Wenbin
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China is universally regarded as
the world's largest emerging market, if its high economic growth
rate is maintained, but for the past few years, it has not had the
fiscal strength to make fresh investment, so some Westerners have
mistaken the country as "a big nation but a small market".
</P>
<P>
However, a market research report from the State Council's
Research and Development Center says that the market potential has
gradually become a reality.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, in the next ten years, China's
economy will grow at 8 percent and China will be the world's
largest investment market, with gross fixed assets investment at
around 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Bureau (SSB) says that consumer spending
in China has been growing at 3 to 4 percentage points more than
the GDP since 1996, and analysts predict that China's economy will
recover later this year or early next year in the wake of
increased investment. This will in turn drive consumer spending
and turn China into the world's largest consumer goods market.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wang Wei, of the Development and Research Center's Market
Research Institute, attributes the lack of consumer power and the
rate of redundancy in some industries to the large number of
identical projects in different locations in the past, but says
this does not suggest any change in China's market capacity.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wang Yuan, a prominent economist, says that China is one of
the few countries with a high level of savings, higher even than
the level of the early 1990s in Japan and in the Republic of Korea
(ROK), according to IMF. The number of households in China with
incomes above 50,000 yuan annually is equivalent to that of a
moderately-developed European country.
</P>
<P>
In fact, overseas investors have benefited from China's huge
market. At present, 68 percent of the equipment, 70 percent of the
automobile parts, a vast majority of precision, digital machine
tools, and 95 percent of the cordless telephones for China's fixed
assets investment are bought overseas.
</P>
<P>
Motorola alone has 2.7 billion U.S. dollars worth of sales
annually in China, accounting for over 70 percent of China's
market share.

</P>
<P>
China has so far drawn more than 100 billion U.S. dollars worth
of investment from overseas and has opened its light industry,
textiles, machine-building, electronics, raw materials, and food
and hotel businesses to overseas investors, and banking,
insurance, retail sales, and foreign trade are opening on a trial
basis.
</P>
<P>
Many signs point to consumer demand in urban areas shifting
from the color TV sets and refrigerators of the past to apartments,
telephones, automobiles, computers, and education and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Domestic tourists now make up over 90 percent of China's
tourists and contribute two-thirds of the country's tourism
earnings. Mobile phone sales have been going up 120 percent and
cordless phones will soon be more common than standard telephones.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rural areas have the most market potential, analysts
say. Statistics show Chinese farmers' per-capita annual incomes
averages at least 2,100 yuan and retail sales of consumer goods in
rural areas reaches more than a trillion yuan, with sales of farm
machinery coming in first in the machine-building sector.
</P>
<P>
According to a State Development Planning Commission official,
China has made opening up the rural market an important component
part of increased economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The state recently announced plans to concentrate investment in
infrastructure in rural areas, including some 5 billion yuan for
power grids.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some observers hold that China's rural market will
have great energy and will become a strong force behind a new
round of economic growth, with an improved standards of living for
farmers.
</P>
<P>
China will not only become the earth's biggest investment
market, but the largest farm machinery, home appliance, insurance
policy, automobile, telecommunications, and tourism market,
offering the world unprecedented business opportunities.

BUCHAREST, June 29 (Xinhua) -- All Romanian officials working
with the Intelligence Agency, Interior Ministry and Defense
Ministry have been ordered to furnish the Supreme Defense Council
with their personal records to see whether they had cooperated
with the former intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
The order, issued on Monday at a special meeting of the
council, asked the Intelligence Agency to hand over all the
records to the council within 10 days, according to the Romanian
news agency Agentie De Presa.
</P>
<P>
Those who had cooperated with the former intelligence agency
will be dismissed from office.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the leaders of the ruling parties and some parliament
members and government officials were accused of having signed
agreements with the former intelligence agency to keep watch over
their colleagues, superiors and subordinates.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister, Francisc Baranyi, and Chairman of the
Parliamentary Commission for the Control of Foreign Information
Service, Adrian Vilau, were forced to resign for this reason
respectively on June 19 and 29.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt's Current Account Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government's current
account improved from a deficit of 93 million U.S. Dollars in the
year ending April 1997 to a deficit of 39 million Dollars in the
year ending April 1998, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) said.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in the current account is attributed to the
services account surplus which rose by 952 million Dollars due to
the reduction in interest rate payments by 97 million Dollars,
Tuesday's East African Standard quoted latest CBK data as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's capital account declined from
surplus of 516 million Dollars in the year to last April to a
deficit of 89 million Dollars in the year to this April.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration is caused by the reduction in the official
medium and long term net capital flows following the halt of the
balance of payments by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
the drop in short-term capital inflow by about 483 million
Dollars from May 1997 to April 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, gross official foreign exchange reserves fell from
1,064 million Dollars covering 4.1 months of imports to 867
million Dollars or 3.3 months of import cover in April 1998.

<HEADLINE> Coal Mine Laid-offs Find New Jobs  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- When Wang Jianguo lost his job as
a coal miner in north China's Shanxi Province a year ago he found
it very difficult to support his family on a monthly allowance of
little more than 100 yuan.
</P>
<P>
To eke out a living, Wang had to sell clothing by wholesale and
do bits of tough physical labor for a difficult period of time.
The results were not very satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
But now he has a permanent job on a highway construction crew,
where his experience in digging holes in a mine has come in
handy. Standing there at the construction site in hard-hat and
overalls, Wang says, "I need to treasure this job opportunity and
guarantee both quality and quantity."
</P>
<P>
The Xishan Coal and Electric Group, where Wang used to work, is
a very large state-owned coal mine with an annual production
capacity of 26 million tons. But, it has dismissed more than 2,000
employees since early last year as a result of falling sales and
loan defaults, the group's chairman, Du Fuxin, explains.
</P>
<P>
In Shanxi, China's largest coal producing province as a whole,
over 130,000 coal miners, most of whom were engaged in non-mining
work, have been laid off in the wake of scaled-down production.
</P>
<P>
To provide new jobs for laid-off coal miners, the provincial
government has built a 30,000-member highway construction corps
consisting of eight teams because China plans to spend 500 billion
yuan on highway construction in the next three years, and Shanxi's
investment on highway will be 30 billion yuan. This is a new
opportunity for unemployed coal miners, says Wang Jiren, director
of the Shanxi Coal Industry Department.
</P>
<P>
These miner-road crew are working on a 7.2-km highway near
Taiyuan, Shanxi's capital, and will work on expressways to
Taiyuan, Datong, and Jiaozuo afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Coal Mine Laid-offs Find New Jobs (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coal mining is a major industry for Shanxi, which is a "sea of
coal". It has eight key state-owned coal mines with a million
employees altogether, whose products are handled by a unified
distribution system.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi has 220 billion tons of coal reserves and produces more
than 300 million tons a year, a quarter of China's output. Over
200 million tons of the province's coal are transported to other
parts of the country and accounts for 80 percent of China's total
coal shipments.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of state-owned enterprises and the
introduction of a more modern system have meant mechanization and
improvements in the mines. The drive to cut the labor force and
improve efficiency allowed the money-losing industry to get out
of red for the first time in 1997. It also left hundreds of
thousands of coal miners jobless.
</P>
<P>
The laid-off miners have been used for non-mining work, which
resulted in more than 3 billion yuan worth of output value last
year and is expected to match the mining industry in output value
by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
In addition to construction work, the former coal mine
employees have been encouraged to work for township-run mines or
to get involved in high-tech agriculture or other trades over the
past six years.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi has a seventh of China's coal miners and it has played a
vital role in this restructuring. Its successful experiment in
exploring new avenues of employment for miners should be tried in
other provinces, says Ma Deqing, a department head in China's
former Coal Industry Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Annan, C'Wealth Chief to Meet Nigerian Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- It would be a very busy day Tuesday
for General Abdulsalam Abubakar who is to meet with United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Commonwealth
Secretary-General Chief Emeka Anyaoku in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry statement said that Annan, who arrived in
Abuja Monday noon for a four-day visit, is expected to discuss
issues of common interest to the U.N. and Nigeria, including the
maintenance of sub-regional peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between General Abubakar and Anyaoku, who arrived
Sunday, will border on issues of interest between Nigeria and the
Commonwealth, especially the continued suspension of the country
from the organization, New Nigerian reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Annan and Anyaoku, following that of British
Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd who was in Nigeria last week
on behalf of the European Union, is expected to help break the
diplomatic isolation Nigeria has been faced with since 1993 when
the Western world imposed sanctions on the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a high-powered delegation from the United States
headed by Under-Secretary Thomas Pickering, is also expected to
be in Nigeria next week for talks with General Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The West has seen the sudden death of Nigeria's former
military leader General Sani Abacha as an opportunity to improve
relations with the most populous black country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Western countries hope Abacha's successor, General Abubakar
would handle the military government's transition to civil rule
program in a way that would bring democracy to the country.

With 50 million yuan (6 million U.S. dollars) in funds from
the central government annually, more than 4,000 scientists are
studying the technique which is believed to markedly increase
grain output in irrigated areas.
</P>
<P>
In the Yangling High-Tech Demonstration Zone -- China's "agro
silicon valley" in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, scientists
are seen working on water-saving and other dry farming
techniques. Their study fields include drought-resistant crops,
seed breeding, water-saving irrigation and dry farming techniques,
farm machinery for arid land, and water resource development.
</P>
<P>
Shan Lun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and
an arid land development specialist, says that the research
programs will play a key role in increased grain outputs in
northern China in the 21st century and will demonstrate
agricultural development in arid areas.
</P>
<P>
Hailing it an important move to build China's own bread basket,
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing called the research China's "strategic
decision".
</P>
<P>
A unique water-saving irrigation technique developed by
scientists there that can reduce the amount of irrigation water by
33 percent has already been used in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces
and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Another program for sustainable development of the Loess
Plateau of scientists at the agro silicon valley has greatly
improved the ecology in many parts of northwestern China and
brought profits of as much as 4 billion yuan in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
China suffers from water shortages and has only 100 million
hectares of arable land for its 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
However, specialists believed that the arid and semi-arid areas
have great grain-growing potential at a time when intensive
farming in southern China has made it difficult to increase crop
output there.

<HEADLINE> New Technology Being Used To Protect Confucius' Temple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China is using new technology to
protect cultural relics in the city of Qufu in China's Shandong
Province, the birthplace of Confucius, the philosopher and
educator who lived about 2,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A 5-million-yuan (about 600,000 US dollars) computer system has
been installed to help protect relics in the Temple, Mausoleum,
and Manor house of his descendants.
</P>
<P>
Files of more than 10,000 relics like pottery, jades, bronze
ware, ivory carvings, ancient books, and paintings housed in the
temple, mausoleum and manor can be seen on a computer system, thus
avoiding damage caused by direct contact, according to Li Bozhu,
who developed the system.
</P>
<P>
He says they plan to include descriptions of all cultural
relics, tablet inscriptions, ancient trees, and buildings in Qufu
in the system in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Qufu has at least 200 ancient buildings, 100,000 ancient tombs,
17,000 ancient trees, 1,000 stone engravings, and 5,000 tablet
inscriptions that date back as early as the Han Dynasty (206
B.C.-220 A.D.). The Temple, Mausoleum, and Manor house are on the
World Cultural Heritage list.
</P>
<P>
Qufu has spent 6.5 million yuan on fire and theft protection
for the buildings in recent years, according to Kong Xianglin, a
descendent of Confucius who is head of the cultural relics
protection committee of Qufu.
</P>
<P>
The city has also built a storehouse for relics that is worth 9
million yuan and is air-conditioned and has an alarm and
sprinkling system for fires.

<HEADLINE> Bright Prospects Ahead for Hong Kong: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- "It is generally believed that
Hong Kong has even brighter prospects," commented the
Chinese-language newspaper Wen Wei Po here Tuesday while reporting
on worldwide reaction over the first anniversary of Hong Kong's
return to China.
</P>
<P>
"The British press has come to re-understand China and Hong
Kong," wrote the newspaper's London-based reporter.
</P>
<P>
Great changes had taken place in the coverage of Hong Kong's
pre-handover and current situation, the report said. "The smooth
transition of Hong Kong greatly changed the attitude towards China
of the British public and press," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's post-handover performance has proved not only that
Hong Kong is nothing of a 'tragedy' but also that the
unprecedented concept of 'one country, two systems' is a success.
It has proved that two different systems can not only co-exist in
one country, but can also help and benefit each other," it said.
</P>
<P>
Another report from Washington said, "Noted American persons
think that Hong Kong can be the first to ride out of the regional
economic turmoil."
</P>
<P>
It said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to the Hong
Kong Special Administration Region (SAR) and participation in the
celebrations of the first anniversary of the handover is one of
the two major events in early July, which will attract worldwide
attention.
</P>
<P>
And U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Hong Kong, the first
ever such visit by a U.S. president, shows Americans' concern over
Hong Kong's continued smooth transition and the Chinese
government's promise of a high level of autonomy for the Hong Kong
SAR, the report quoted a former U.S. deputy secretary of state as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Many American notables are satisfactory over Hong Kong's
performance since the handover, it noted. Politically speaking,
they think, Hong Kong's handover should be taken as being very
smooth and successful.
</P>
<P>
Although Hong Kong is suffering from regional economic
downturn, its economic format remains the most open and free in
the world. With a solid financial mechanism and economic
foundation, the rule of law and a corruption-free government, Hong
Kong enjoys bright prospects, the report further said.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia is also one of the areas which have the closest
economic ties with Hong Kong, Wen Wei Po's Jakarta-based reporter
said. Although suffering seriously from the regional economic
crisis, Indonesians interviewed by the reporter all felt happy
with post-handover Hong Kong's achievements and they are confident
of Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong remains Southeast Asian countries' most important
partner for cooperation in the fields of social culture, finance
and investment, science, technology and information as well as
economic relations and trade, the reporter said.
</P>
<P>
Many convincing facts in the past year have approved that Hong
Kong will continue to play an important role in the process of
economic globalization and governments of many Southeast Asian
countries expressed their desire to develop even closer
cooperation with Hong Kong in various fields, the reporter added.

<HEADLINE> Economic Integration In Eastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 30 (Xinhua) - The Shanghai Light Industry
Holding Group recently signed an agreement here with the city of
Ruijin in China's Jiangxi Province for the world's largest
sewing machine needle factory as yet another example of the
transfer of labor intensive projects from developed Chinese cities
and provinces to less-developed areas in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Early this month at a trade fair, Jiangxi, in east China,
signed 440 contracts with Shanghai and the coastal provinces of
Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Fujian for agriculture, industry, and
infrastructure projects worth five billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Fujian and Jiangsu also held trade fairs to try to attract
investment from Shanghai and provided 50 major projects, worth 4
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, China decided to speed up economic development of the
Yangtze River Delta and eastern China, with Shanghai as the main
engine driving the development. The East has become the country's
most developed area and accounts for 40 percent of China's exports
and 46 percent of its foreign capital accounts.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that economic cooperation in the East needs to
increase and the best use of their different economic advantages
made.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Anhui, Fujian, and Jiangxi have
thousands of companies in Shanghai, with registered capital
exceeding 10 billion yuan, and Shanghai's investment in those six
provinces accounts for 60 percent of its investment outside the
city.

<HEADLINE> Western China Claims Oldest Amphibian With A Tail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese biologist says that a
salamander living in remote mountain streams of western China may
be the oldest amphibian with a tail in existence.
</P>
<P>
The animal, Ranodon Sibiricus, was discovered 8 years ago in
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, where it has lived for over
300 million years, according to Wang Xiuling, a professor at
Xinjiang Teachers' University.
</P>
<P>
She says, however, that biologists have yet to find fossils
that could support this claim, although fossils of other
salamanders have been found in the region.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 of the animals now live in three streams at an
altitude of about 2,500 meters above sea level, Wang says, and
local biologists are looking for more of the rare animals in a
stream 3,200 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The ancient amphibian lives only in western China and eastern
Kazakhstan and provides important information for zoology and
species evolution.
</P>
<P>
Wang and her colleagues have successfully bred the amphibian
since 1990 and are now trying to move it to other places with more
friendly environmental conditions for better protection.

<P>
GUIYANG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou Province
aims to resolve its drinking water shortage by the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
A drinking-water shortage has been the major hindrance to the
province's development, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The shortage is mainly caused by the karst topography, which
takes up nearly 70 percent of the province.
</P>
<P>
"The vegetation is poor here because of the karst topography,
and that results in a poor water-reservation capacity," a local
expert said.
</P>
<P>
The province, one of China's poorest regions, has spent 263
million yuan in the past one and half years to quench the
drinking-water shortage of some 980,000 people and 680,000
livestocks.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the province plans to spend a huge amount of
money every year to ease the water shortage by the end of this

</P>
<P>
The press has reported these back to the United States and the

noted.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on China's entry into World Trade
Organization (WTO), Clinton said it is important for China to be a
member of WTO, "because China is a major power and emerging
economy."
</P>
<P>
"We in America support Chinese growth. We are the largest
purchaser of Chinese products," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two sides could reach agreement
before long on the issue.
</P>
<P>
With regard to educational exchanges, Clinton said that upon
his return home, "I will see what I can do. I will send more
Americans to China and I will make it possible to have more
Chinese to the States, because this will do good to the U.S.-China
relations."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also pointed out that the two countries have a lot in
common although they have differences on some issues.

HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, a small region of
less than 1,100 square kilometers inhabited by over six million
people, has developed into an economic powerhouse despite its lack
of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong economy has nearly quadrupled over the past two
decades, with its GDP growing at an average annual rate of about
seven percent in real terms. The World Bank has ranked Hong Kong's
per capita GDP, in terms of purchasing power parity, the sixth
highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong holds the world's third largest foreign exchange
reserves, after Japan and China's mainland. Its foreign currency
assets totaled 96.4 billion U.S. dollars at the end of May 1998.
</P>
<P>
As a small and open economy, Hong Kong's economic success owes
a great deal to the remarkable performance of its external trade
sector.
It is the world's seventh largest trading economy, and the U.S.
Heritage Foundation has named Hong Kong the freest economy in the
globe four years in a row.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has established itself as a major international
financial center. It is the world's fifth largest banking center
in terms of the volume of external banking transactions, and the
fifth largest foreign exchange market in terms of turnover. Its
stock market is Asia's second largest in terms of market
capitalization and ranks the seventh in the world. Hong Kong is
also the world's fourth largest gold bullion market.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has emerged as Asia's services hub, with exports of
services ranging from accounting and legal services, to insurance
and fund-raising, and telecommunications and media.
</P>
<P>
Low tax rates, a level-playing field, rule of law, clean
government, free flow of information, free market competition, and
efficient infrastructure have all contributed to the success of
Hong Kong economy.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is a major
international financial center, thanks to its favorable
geographical position, bridging the time gap between North America
and Europe, and its strong links with the Chinese inland areas and
other parts of Asia.
</P>
<P>
The absence of any restriction on capital flows is also an
important factor for the development of the Hong Kong financial
industry.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the world's fifth largest banking center in terms
of the volume of external banking transactions. It has a very
strong presence of international institutions. Some 500 banks and
deposit-taking companies from 43 countries and regions have
operations here, including 82 of the world's top 100 banks.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a mature and active foreign exchange market,
which ranks the fifth in the world and forms an integral part of
the global market.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the world's fourth largest gold bullion market.
Its stock market is Asia's second largest in terms of market
capitalization and ranks the seventh in the world. The stock
market acts as an important funding source for companies in Asia,
particularly for those Chinese enterprises seeking overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's derivative market is among Asia's largest,
reflecting the increased sophistication of its financial markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong economy is highly
externally oriented and dependent on trade with the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
The city was placed the world's eighth largest trading entity
in 1997 by the World Trade Organization (WTO), accounting for 3.6
percent of world total trade.
</P>
<P>
The value of Hong Kong's total merchandise trade amounted to
3,071 billion HK dollars (393.7 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, or
around 230 percent of the GDP for the year.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that Hong Kong's position as an international
trading center has been well preserved after the handover. The
Basic Law guarantees continuation of Hong Kong's economic and
trading system, the free movement of goods and capital and its
status as a free port and separate customs territory.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional document of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of China also provides that Hong Kong may
continue to participate in relevant international trade
organizations and agreements. Hong Kong is now a member of the
WTO, the World Customs Organization and the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 witnessed modest export growth of Hong Kong.
Government figures showed that the value of total exports in the
whole year of 1997 stood at 1,455.9 billion HK dollars (186.6
billion U.S. dollars), up 4.2 percent over the same period of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports made up 85 percent of the value of total export,
reflecting the continued importance of Hong Kong as an entrepot
for China's mainland, Hong Kong's number one trading partner.
</P>
<P>
The value of re-exports in 1997 was 1,244.5 billion HK dollars
(159.6 billion U.S. dollars), 5 percent higher, while the value of
domestic exports, at 211.4 billion HK dollars (27.1 billion U.S.
dollars), dipped slightly by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The value of imports increased by 5.2 percent to 1,615.1
billion HK dollars (207.1 billion U.S. dollars). Therefore a
visible trade deficit of 159.1 billion HK dollars (20.4 billion
U.S. dollars), equivalent to 9.9 percent of the value of imports,
was recorded for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland accounted for one-third of Hong Kong's
total merchandise trade, followed by the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Dampened by the regional financial crisis and a major downturn
in the tourism industry, Hong Kong's export of services showed
almost no increase in 1997 against the previous year, following an
8.6 percent increase for the whole of 1996.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, the regional entrepot
of finance and trade, is marked by the high degree of import and
application of advanced technology, particularly that related to
information industry.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of its status of free port, Hong Kong
maintains economic links with over 100 countries and regions,
making it a pivot of information, and now it is trying to build
itself into "the most informed city in the world" as described by
the Hong Kong Telecom.
</P>
<P>
Wired by satellite, optical fibers, cables, microwaves and
other media, Hong Kong has formed an information network,
particularly economic information network, both locally and
globally.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the first major city in the world to have a fully
digitized telephone network and the amount of its outgoing
international phone calls is much higher than both the United
States and Japan. Hong Kong now has a telecommunications network
comprising over 300,000 kilometers of optical fiber.
</P>
<P>
About one-sixth of Hong Kong's population or 1.1 million people
have subscribed to paging services -- the highest per-capita rate
in the world. And a total of over 1 million subscribers to
cellular phone services also is among the highest levels of
penetration in the world.
</P>
<P>
A recent market survey showed that the home penetration rate of
PC is over 50 percent and there are more than 850,000 Internet
users in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In March, the world's first-ever interactive TV (iTV) was
launched in Hong Kong, making it possible for people to see films,
listen to music or deal with financial affairs at any time with
clicks of a few buttons at home. And just two weeks ago, the
Internet service was added to the iTV network, enabling users to
get access to the worldwide web at a surprisingly high speed.
</P>
<P>
An international conference on the future of information and
communications technology in Asia had just concluded in Hong Kong.
Organizers of the conference said the city provides a dynamic,
technology-rich environment, whose government sees technology as a
critical component of Hong Kong's successful future. Also, the
regional hub provides an open location in which to examine the
various models of technology throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s, Hong Kong has brought in U.S. and Japanese
investment in electronic industry, which has become the second
largest industry in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Technology advancement is a key factor of economic growth in
Hong Kong. A research on the manufacturing sector in Hong Kong
shows that technology development accounted for an average of 42.9
percent in the sector's production during the period of 1969 to
1982.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's technology development is market-oriented and
characterized by high efficiency. For instance, it usually takes a
mere three months for general electronics and plastics from
product design to production.
</P>
<P>
There are several prestigious academic institutions in Hong
Kong, including Hong Kong University, the Chinese University of
Hong Kong, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and
they are well equipped and have absorbed talents from all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
Political and social stability ensures Hong Kong favorable
working and living conditions. In addition, Hong Kong's ability to
develop technology-rich products has been well-complimented by the
abundant outcome of the ever-increasing scientific research in
China's inland areas.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong maintained its
position as the world's busiest container port for six years in a
row in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Including container terminals, mid-stream and river trade, it
handled 14.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of
containers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent, by weight, of Hong Kong's external trade is
handled by the port, according to Hong Kong's Port Development
Board (POB), which forecasts that, with the economic and trade
development of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong has
to cope with a steady growth of container cargo well into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
A new container terminal, Container Terminal 9, is expected to
be completed in the early 2000s, which will expand substantially
the handling capacity of the existing eight container terminals at
the Kwai Chung/Stonecutters Island Container Port.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, work continued on both the new River Trade Terminal
at Tuen Men and the Permanent Mid-stream Facility at Stonecutters
Island. Both facilities are due to come into operation this year.
</P>
<P>
The throughput of the Hong Kong container port is forecast to
grow on an annual average of 5.8 percent in the next 10 years to
24 million TEUs in 2006, and Hong Kong will retain its role as the
major container port for import and export to the Chinese
mainland, according to the latest findings of the Hong Kong Port
Cargo Forecasts commissioned by POB.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Hong Kong remains a prominent center for
ship-owning, ship-financing and ship-management. Latest figures
from the Hong Kong Shipping Register showed that a total fleet of
486 vessels, amounting to 6.13 million gross registered tons
(GRT), were registered under Hong Kong flag.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong also stands as the hub of international and regional
aviation, with the status certainly to be enhanced by the
forthcoming opening of the new international airport at Chek Lap
Kok.
</P>
<P>
Having served Hong Kong for several decades, the existing Kai
Tak airport has been lauded as one of the safest and most
efficient airports in the world. In the financial year ending
March 31, 1997, the passenger throughput at Kai Tak grew by 7.5
percent to over 30 million while air cargo throughput jumped by
9.8 percent to over 1.6 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Kai Tak overtook Tokyo Narita to become the world's
busiest airport in terms of international cargo. In respect of
international passengers, it remained the third busiest after
London Heathrow and Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate continued robust growth in air traffic, the
20-billion-U.S. dollar Airport Core Program was started in the
early 1990s. The world-class infrastructure project consists of
10 projects: the new airport, the airport railway, roads, bridges
and tunnels and even a new town.
</P>
<P>
Upon opening on July 6, with the first of the two runways in
operation, the new airport is able to handle 35 million passengers
and up to 3 million tons of air cargo annually.

MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government's
domestic debts increased to 762.6 billion pesos (19 billion U.S.
dollars) in April, 3 percent higher than in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report of the Bureau of Treasury, of
the amount, 98.95 percent is real obligations of the national
government, and the rest is contingent liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Real obligations refer to those directly borrowed or assumed by
the national government while contingent liabilities are debts
borrowed by government-owned or controlled corporations and
agencies which are guaranteed by the government.
</P>
<P>
The report said that of the real obligations, 752.2 billion
pesos are direct loans of the national government, most of which
were borrowed in the form of government securities such as
Treasury bills and bonds.
</P>
<P>
As of April, the report said, the total securities issued by
the government amounted to 460.3 billion pesos (11.5 billion
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Passes Finance Bill for New Fiscal Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Jatiya Sangsad, the
country's parliament, passed the Finance Bill 1998 for the 1998-99
fiscal year beginning July 1, press reports here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Bill, to come into effect on July 1, was adopted
after Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria declared amendments to
the tax measures proposed in the new budget, including the
withdrawal or reduction of taxes, duties and value-added taxes on
16 items.
</P>
<P>
Most of the tax and duty reductions are on raw materials of
certain local industries such as specialized textiles, power looms
and henolic resin and on items like bicycle and rickshaw spare
parts, cement and medical and surgical equipment used by ordinary
people, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of proposals for enhanced taxes and duties were
based on discussions on the budget by the opposition members of
parliament, suggestions offered by different business bodies and
comments made in newspapers, the fiancee minister told the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal or reduction of the new taxation proposals would
cause a revenue loss of more than 277 million taka (about 6
million U.S. dollars) and the government would make good the loss
by initiating appropriate administrative measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The budget for the new financial year is expected to be passed
by the parliament Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> hke - UN Promises Help in Funding for Cambodian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The UN special representative
of the secretary-general, Lakhan Mehrohtra, pledged Monday that
the United Nations will do its best to help raise funds for
specific tasks related to Cambodia's elections.
</P>
<P>
Mehrohtra made the remarks during a meeting with members of
Cambodia's National Election Committee (NEC) on election-related
issues. The world body estimated that some 3.7 million
U.S. dollars was still needed by the NEC.
</P>
<P>
The UN envoy praised the NEC's work so far and agreed with NEC
Chairman HE Chheng Phon that voter education programs were a
priority for both organizations.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP trust fund has garnered two million U.S. dollars for a
voter education campaign. The NEC plans to disseminate the message
that the vote is secret, and that voters should be able to
exercise their democratic rights free from intimidation.
</P>
<P>
The UN raised some concerns about the process on polling day,
emphasizing the need for indelible ink to ensure that no person
can vote twice, and the counting process at commune level.
</P>
<P>
NEC Vice-chairman Kassie Neou said that the contents of at
least three ballot boxes will be mixed together before each count,
but in the vast majority of communes the mix will include many
more than three boxes. Most CECs will cover between four and 33
polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question by Mehrohtra on how regulations against
bias are enforced in the electronic media, the NEC replied that it
has set up a unit to monitor the air time given to each party.
</P>
<P>
The month-long campaign, which began peacefully on June 25 and
entered its sixth day Tuesday, has so far gone smoothly without
any violence.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's National Assembly election has largely been seen as
a contest between three main parties--the CPP of the influential
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, the Funcinpec party of the deposed
first prime minister Prince Ranariddh and opposition leader Sam
Rainsy's party named after himself.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Sets Up First-Ever Tea Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is setting up the first
tea museum in the hill capital of Kandy, 115 kilometers from here,
according to tea board sources Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tea museum is to mark over 100 years of tea production
which has culminated in the country becoming the world's best tea
producer.
</P>
<P>
Tea seeds were introduced to Sri Lanka from China more than 160
years ago. James Taylor, a Briton, planted tea for the first time
on a 20-acre block at Deltota in the hill country in 1867.
</P>
<P>
The museum is being established by the Sri Lankan Planters'
Association in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Tea Board. It will
have on display obsolete machinery and other items of historical
value from field and factory.
</P>
<P>
The sources said daily instruction books of estate managers and
labor muster books over a century old had been discovered. Antique
tea machinery over 100 years old is being restored. A set of
priceless antique photographs has been obtained from England for
the museum.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the tea museum is expected to cost 625,000
U.S. dollars while maintenance costs are expected to exceed 1,000
dollars per month, according to the sources.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday appealed to all parties in armed conflicts to end the
practice of targeting children.
</P>
<P>
The council strongly condemned the targeting of children in
armed conflicts and called on all parties concerned to strictly
comply with their obligations under international law, a
presidential statement said.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the importance of the mandate of the Special
Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General on Children in Armed
Conflict, the council expressed its support for his activities.
</P>
<P>
Before the statement was issued, Olara Otunnu, the special
representative, drew the council's attention to the somber picture
of children in affected countries.
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, two million children have been killed as a
result of armed conflicts, with more than one million orphaned,
and six million seriously injured or permanently disabled, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another 12 million had been made homeless and 10 million left
with serious psychological trauma.
</P>
<P>
"Children, especially young women, have been made the targets
of rape and other forms of sexual violence on a large scale," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu, a former Ugandan foreign minister who took the current
U.N. job in 1997, said a quarter of a million young persons under
the age of 18 are estimated to be under arms today.

<HEADLINE> More College Students Become CPC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials announced today,
on the eve of the 77th anniversary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), that 4 out of every 100 Chinese college students are
members of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The 129,000 college students who are CPC members represent an
increase of 113,000 since 1990, when that was only 0.8 percent
of the students.
</P>
<P>
Among graduate students, 41,000 are Party members, or 26.2
percent of the total, a 4 percent increase since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jianguo, a Ministry of Education official, says that
college students have become more confident about the CPC as a
result of political and social stability, economic growth, an
improved standard of living, and success in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences says that the 15th Party
Congress, Hong Kong's return, Jiang Zemin's U.S. visit, and
China's actions during the Asian financial crisis have had a
good effect on Chinese youth. And, a course on "Deng Xiaoping
Theory" recently started at Chinese universities has become one of
the most popular.
</P>
<P>
"The course helped me understand what socialism is and how to
build socialism, and to know that the CPC will lead China to a
bright future," says Zhang Jie, a student in the International
Relations Department of Beijing University, where Party members
account for 12 percent of the student body.
</P>
<P>
Many colleges have Marxism societies. At a recent seminar on
Marxism in Beijing University, teachers and students agreed that
though there have been ups and downs, China's reforms and opening
up have proven that Marxism will continue if it improves.
</P>
<P>
Li Wenhai, the president of People's University, says that, in
the 1990s, many colleges have been paying greater attention to
improving morales and have provided students with more
opportunities to better understand society.
</P>
<P>
"Students have more information about reality, and their sense
of social responsibility and patriotic passion have increased," he
says, so more students have applied to join the Party.
</P>
<P>
A fourth to a third of the 3 million students in China's 1,000
universities and colleges have applied, because, in the words of
Cheng Shuihua, a student at Shanghai's Fudan University, "Being a
Party member is the best way for me to devote myself to the
nation."
</P>
<P>
Wang, the Education Ministry official, says that most student
Party members have quick and independent minds and good morale
character, and usually get good grades. Many are good at
organizing social activities.
</P>
<P>
Some of them have volunteered to work in remote,
poverty-stricken areas after graduation, and many have been sought
by big companies, including joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 150th anniversary of the "Communist Manifesto"
and the 90th anniversary of Marxism in China, where universities
were the cradle of Communist thought. The CPC was founded in July
1, 1921, with 57 Party members. That number has grown to more than
58 million.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Attracts Foreign Investment to Industry Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been carrying out an
extensive marketing drive to attract foreign investments to its
first foreign-invested industrial zone, the Mingaladon Industrial
Park, to obtain technology for tapping the country's rich natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
The 89-hectare industrial park in Yangon, whose infrastructure
facilities were established by the Mitsui Co. Ltd. of Japan under
a joint venture contract with the state-run Myanmar Department of
Human Settlement and Housing Development, has drawn investors
from Japan, South Korea, Singapore and China's Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, these investors have taken 15
percent of the total industrial land available for long-term lease
for at least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Following the completion of the construction of the industrial
park (phase one) in two years' time since March 1996, detailed
design and feasibility study for phase-two development are under
way.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that when all phases of the project are
completed, investment from not only Japan but also the Southeast
Asian region and other parts of the world would be obtained to set
up enterprises there, according to a Myanmar official.
</P>
<P>
The 20-million-dollar Mingaladon Industrial Park project,
located in the north of Yangon, is one of the five planned
industrial zones in the capital. Three of them are
foreign-invested and the Mingaladon is the forerunner. The other
two are being developed mainly by Singaporean, Malaysian and Thai
companies.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 17 industrial zones have been established in Myanmar
including those in Yangon, Mandalay, Bago, Hinthada, Myaungmya,
Myeik, Yenangyaung, Pyay, Mingyan and Meiktila.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, foreign investment in the
industrial sector (processing and manufacturing) amounted to 1.43
billion U.S. dollars in 113 projects by March, the end of the
1997-98 fiscal year, ranking second after oil and gas out of a
total foreign investment of 7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The sector also stood as the second largest contributor to
Myanmar's gross domestic product after agriculture, sharing 9.2
percent of the GDP in the 1997-98 fiscal year, a 4.6-percent
growth.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Inflation Hits 46.5 Pct. in 1st Semester </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rapidly escalating
prices saw the June inflation rate reach 4.64 percent, sending the
inflation rate to 46.5 percent for the first semester of this
year, the local press Tuesday quoted the Central Bureau of
Statistics as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The June figure was largely due to increases in the prices of
rice, food flavoring and gold jewelry," the bureau's chief Suwito
Sugito said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Increases in the price of rice contributed 25 percent to the
inflation figure rise while more expensive gold jewelry
contributed 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Amid the current crisis conditions, people prefer to invest
their money in gold," Sugito said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that controlling the price of rice is an
important element in curbing inflation because that amid the sharp
fall in people's purchasing power, the main pressure on the
consumer price index would come from the foodstuffs category.
</P>
<P>
"Of the five largest contributors to the June inflation figure,
four were foodstuffs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sugito expressed the hope that the rainy season coming earlier
than last year would boost the country's rice output. The 3.1
million tons of rice to be imported by the government this year
would stabilize the availability and price of the commodity, he
added.

<HEADLINE> China - A Very Open Nation, Says American Businessman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIHAI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- An American businessman said here
today that U.S. President Bill Clinton would find out during his
nine-day state visit that China is a "very open" nation and its
opening-up is more fully than Americans and Europeans think.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton's visit to China marks a dialogue
between two major countries in the world, and will have worldwide
impact," said Jean Michel Molin, president of the US-funded
Dole-Tropicana China Beihai Food Corp.
</P>
<P>
The company has leased 3,079 hectares of land in Beihai, a
coastal city in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
for orange planting, and a large orange juice plant will be
erected there.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment of nearly 50 million US dollars, it is
currently the largest US-funded agricultural project in China,
said Molin.
</P>
<P>
"As the president of an American business, I feel very good
working in Guangxi. With the support of officials at all levels,
we have no difficulties in developing business here, and our
production keeps growing," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that he was very pleased to know that
President Clinton would also pay a visit to the picturesque city
of Guilin in Guangxi during his China trip.
</P>
<P>
"I never heard of Guangxi before I came here," said Molin.
"Clinton's visit to Guilin will increase the popularity of Guangxi
and help more people to learn about this region."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the belief that President Clinton's visit
would bring more trade opportunities for both America and China.
</P>
<P>
"I hope more foreign business people will come to invest here,
and experience a different and colorful culture at the same time,"
he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Armed Forces Commander Denies They Still </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
Monday denied that they are still loyal to former President
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"ABRI does not receive direct orders or instructions from
former President Soeharto. All of the accusations that ABRI is
under his control are untrue," ABRI Commander/Defense Minister
General Wiranto was quoted by the local press Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"When he was president, there was a structural relationship as
he was our supreme commander. But now it is clear the structural
relationship no longer exists," Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that he could not avoid maintaining a
"cultural relationship" with Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
He said that as an Indonesian, who adheres to an Eastern
culture, he could not simply discard past good relations with
Soeharto just because the latter is no longer president.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto stepped down on May 21 amid mounting demands for his
resignation as the country was hit by political and economic
crisis. While he holds no official position since stepping down,
speculation continues to circulate that Soeharto retains influence
over ABRI's top brass.
</P>
<P>
According to The Jakarta Post, during most of his public
appearances recently, which have been very few and usually
centered around Friday prayers, Soeharto has been seen accompanied
by a senior ABRI officer. Last Friday, Soeharto attended prayers
at the Army's headquarters in Central Jakarta and met Army Chief
of Staff General Subagyo Hadisiswoyo.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is planning to work out an
information technology program in an effort to promote the
development and advancement of computer technology in the country.
</P>
<P>
The plan was discussed at the first symposium on the
information technology initiative held here Monday, the official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The symposium took place after two Myanmar associations of
computer technicians and entrepreneurs were formed last month.
</P>
<P>
Plans are also under way to conduct master and doctorate
courses with the assistance of a foreign university following the
opening of institutes of computer science and technology in two
major cities of Yangon and Mandalay with graduate and
post-graduate courses conducted, said First Secretary of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council Lieutenant-General
Khin Nyunt at the symposium.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for effective application of advanced
technology for rapid national progress and uplifting of society.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar started computerized teaching at universities and
institutes in 1993.
</P>
<P>
After the promulgation of its Computer Technology Development
Law in September 1996, the country has striven for the progress of
computer technology, successfully launching the first interactive
CD last month on "Myanmar Another Incarnation," which covers
various aspects on the country.

<HEADLINE> China's Poorest Areas to be Lifed Out of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China's three poorest areas, all
located in the northwest, are expected to be free from poverty in
1999 after a senior official in Dingxi, referred to as the
"poorest place on earth", announced today that it will be lifted
from poverty next year.
</P>
<P>
Liu Lijun, deputy commissioner of Gansu Province's Dingxi
Prefecture, said Dingxi will free most of its area from poverty
this year and eradicate poverty next year as part of the Chinese
government's ambitious goal of eradicating poverty by the end of
the century.
</P>
<P>
Following the successful poverty relief effort in the Gansu's
Hexi Prefecture and the determination of Dingxi to eliminate
poverty in 1999, the other area, Xihaigu Prefecture in nearby
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, also announced that it will get rid
of poverty by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Dingxi, Hexi and Xihaigu, are known as the "three Xi's". Their
380,000 square kilometers account for one of the largest
poverty-stricken areas in China.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the Chinese government committed itself to eradicating
poverty by the end of the century and analysts say that the
success of the poverty-relief efforts in the three Xi's is vital
to the success of that program. One United Nations representative
who visited Dingxi commented that the success story of the three
Xi's gives new hope for poor regions in other areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the Chinese government decided to allocate 200 million
yuan (24 million U.S. dollars) each year to help the three
prefectures deal with the extreme poverty and worsening ecological
conditions as the first national poverty-relief program.
</P>
<P>
By now, it has put three billion yuan into the program, helping
over three million people there escape poverty. Hexi was the first
to get totally free from poverty and has become a national grain,
cotton, and edible oil center.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the extreme dry conditions, Dingxi for a long time
lacked even basic subsistence conditions, but now, a visitor is
struck by the tree-covered hills, the green terraced fields, and
the dams. Farmers here used to live in cave dwellings, but now
have built brick and tile houses and even some two-story homes.
</P>
<P>
But, one of the most unusual changes is the cistern in the
courtyard of almost every home and in the fields. It is also the
major source of the changes around these parts, where great
changes have taken place, with the number of people living below
the poverty line going from over 1.7 million in 1982 to the
present 472,000, Liu explains.
</P>
<P>
China has about 50 million rural people living below the
poverty line, or about a twentieth of the world's poor.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Extend Loans to Small Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will pump 10
billion baht (238 million U.S. dollars) into a fund that will lend
to small and medium-sized manufacturers to ease their cash-flow
problems, the Bangkok Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi as saying the loans would be channeled through the
Export-Import Bank and the Small Industries Finance Corporation
(SIFC).
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry will lend 5 billion baht (119 million
dollars) at low interest rates to the Exim Bank, which will lend
the funds to local trading companies.
</P>
<P>
The trading companies in turn will re-lend the money to smaller
producers whose products they help to distribute overseas.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said at a senior economic ministers' meeting Monday
that the loans would help increase the sales of small and
medium-sized industries by up to 3 billion baht (71.4 million
dollars) this year, 8 billion baht (190 million dollars) next year
and 12 billion baht (285.7 million dollars) in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The other 5 billion baht for the program will come from the
structural adjustment loans funded by the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also approved in principle the request of the SIFC
to seek another 1.36 billion baht (32.4 million dollars) for
lending, in addition to the 1.48 billion (35.2 million dollars)
already extended to small manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Consider Expanding Use of "Smart Card" as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) governments will consider expanding the use of a
"smart card" as a formal travel document for their citizens after
they have harmonized their immigration regulations.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Indonesia's Immigration Directorate General
spokesman H.B. Lapian on the sidelines of an ASEAN immigration
meeting in Batam near Singapore on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Before the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) begins in the year
2003, ASEAN member states should have finalized preparations to
use a common smart card," Lapian was quoted by Antara News Agency
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The smart card is already in use by citizens of Singapore,
Malaysia and Indonesia to travel between the countries while the
six other ASEAN member countries have had to postpone its use by
their citizens due to lack of skilled human resources and
finances.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand,
the Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos.
</P>
<P>
Lapian said the smart card, functioning as a travel document,
would enable ASEAN member countries to accelerate their region's
economic growth together.
</P>
<P>
The card is also needed in anticipating developments in
intra-ASEAN travel in the globalization and free trade era, he
said, adding that the card's finalization required the ASEAN
governments' political will.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN immigration meeting in Batam, attended by delegates
from all ASEAN member states, was a follow-up of meetings among
ASEAN member countries' immigration authorities in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, and Jakarta last year.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Monday, Indonesia was elected to chair a
technical working group because the country is supposed to have
experience in using the smart card since July 1994.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Fujian Province Couple Sought for Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The public security bureau in
Fujian Province are seeking fugitives Gao Xiaoduan and Zhuang
Deshuang, who fled China not long ago, for fraudulently obtaining
100,000 yuan (8,200 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Gao and Zhuang started a knit garment factory in 1992 in Yonghe
Township in the city of Jinjiang, east China's Fujian Province. In
examing their records, police discovered that the couple had left
behind debts of 2.05 million yuan (256,250 U.S. dollars). The
money was borrowed from the local branch of the Agricultural Bank
of China, township and village foundations, and a dozen
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Investigations revealed that Gao Xiaoduan and Zhuang Deshuang
borrowed 100,000 yuan from the Yonghe Township Foundation on May
4, 1995 under the name Zhuang Debao, Zhuang Deshuang's
cousin. Zhuang Deshuang acted as the guarantor.
</P>
<P>
But Zhuang Debao denied that he had ever borrowed from the
foundation and his signature on the receipt was apparently forged
by Gao Xiaoduan.
</P>
<P>
The local public security bureau determined that Gao and Zhuang
had violated the law by collaborating and forging the signature to
get the public funds. The Jinjiang People's Procuratorate has
issued an order of arrest for the fugitive couple.

PRAGUE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Slovakian government has decided
to offer 10-year income tax exemption to all foreign enterprises
set up in Slovakia in and after 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the new preferential policy which comes into effect on
July 1, the enterprises which qualify must be manufacturers
spending 300 million Korunas (9.38 million U.S. dollars) to

39.5 percent up from 1996. The total direct foreign investment
attracted by Slovakia from 1993 to 1997 was 3.58 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although 1997 saw the largest direct foreign investment in
Slovakia since its independence in 1993, investment was markedly
lower than in its neighbors, including Hungary, Poland and the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Slovakian government has repeatedly said that it would take
various measures to attract more foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Business Confidence in China Unaffected by Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Despite the Asian economic crisis,
the majority of U.S. companies in China are still "cautiously
optimistic" about China's economic prospects, according to a
survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of the 162 respondents said their business
plans in China remain unaffected by problems elsewhere in Asia,
and 33 percent plan to deal with Asia's financial crisis by
focusing more on doing business in China.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that U.S. companies in China depend on
good Sino-U.S. relations. Almost all 162 business executives who
responded to the survey cited Sino-U.S. relations as having
significant effects on their business in China. One-fourth of the
respondents said Sino-U.S. relations greatly affect their ability
to do business. And, overall, 93 percent reported at least
moderate effects.
</P>
<P>
In further indications of confidence, almost nine of 10
companies plan to expand their businesses in China in the next
3-to-5 years, while two of three said they believe the Chinese
business climate is improving despite financial downturns
elsewhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, four of five plan to increase the number of their
Chinese employees; one in four plans to substantially increase the
number of local employees. Nearly half plan to keep the number of
expatriate employees working in China, while 31 percent plan to
increase the number of expatriate employees.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the changes in the past 20 years, Philip Carmichael,
vice chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said
the investment environment in China is gradually improving. He is
optimistic about prospects in China, though some difficulties
still exist in doing business in the country.
</P>
<P>
The American Chamber of Commerce has more than 1,100 corporate
and individual members in China and represents more than 500
U.S. companies doing business in China.

<HEADLINE> Commercial Factors Plague China's "Sound of Music" Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Commercial factors continue to
threaten the success of the Chinese production of "The Sound Of
Music," despite the outstanding artistic quality, according to a
recent issue of China Management News.
</P>
<P>
Chinese artists Wang Gang and wife, Cheng Fangyuan, reportedly
gambled their fortunes to produce Chinese version of the "The
Sound of Music" for the enjoyment of their curious and
enthusiastic countrymen. However, the publications reported that
the intended beneficiaries of the play have complained about the
poor commercial quality of the production.
</P>
<P>
Cheng, who previously abandoned her career as a singer to study
music in the United States, returned home to introduce the musical
to the Chinese audiences. However, the producers were unable to
find a suitable agency to administer related commercial affairs
due to the lack of familiarity with the western art
form. Consequently, the couple were forced to assume the role of
an agent.
</P>
<P>
"I'm only an artist, and know little about business," said
Wang. "We can only offer estimated figures for the income and
expenditures involved for each performance."
</P>
<P>
The debut performance in Beijing was a hit despite rumors of
financial problems. The success was followed by invitations to
appear in Shanghai, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and various other
cities, a fact which the newspaper reported as being a major
headache for the artists involved.
</P>
<P>
The publication clarified the statement, however, by noting
that the production team surveyed the minute details of
transporting and determined the need for ten trucks to carry props.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a host for China Central Television, expressed his
amazement that the musical was staged 1,400 time on Broadway, but
noted that the level of success depends extensive promotions.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Threatens to Step Down Unless Partners Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
on Monday threatened to resign if talks between the parties in his
parliamentary coalition fail to agree on a policy platform for the
next year.
</P>
<P>
The Prodi government almost collapsed last week when the
Communist Refoundation party, whose votes give it a majority in
the Lower House, voted against NATO enlargement. The government
only survived thanks to the support of the centrist UDR party,
which is not part of the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Now the government has given itself a week to reach an accord
with Communist Refoundation on the main outline of its policies
for the next year and thus to avoid a repeat of last week's
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who wants to avoid fresh elections, stressed what was
needed was a "serious, thorough discussion to produce a government
which would last," according to the ANSA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Despite wanting to keep his government alive, Prodi has
repeatedly said he will not lead any other coalition than the
present one. His resignation would open the way for snap
elections.
</P>
<P>
"The country needs to continue along the line we have followed
in the last two years," he continued. "Italians need to know what
our policies will be up to the end of this legislature."
</P>
<P>
In order to reach an agreement which would keep Prodi in
office, the government will have to overcome serious differences
with Communist Refoundation. Among the contested issues are how
to tackle unemployment and boost the economy in the depressed
south and whether Italy should allow NATO to use its airbases for
possible air strikes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Communist Refoundation leader Fausto Bertinotti insists that he
is not afraid of going to elections immediately and appears ready
to bring the government down if he does not get his way.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very worried," he said Monday, when asked about the
chances of reaching an accord during the week of meetings which
began Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It depends essentially on the government's ability to take a
reformist turn," he said, shortly before meeting his party's
leadership to hammer out a common stance for the coming days.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States and South
Korea will discuss how to ease U.S. sanctions on the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) as South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung had proposed, the State Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The working-level meeting will be held in Honolulu on July
13-15, and officials from both countries will "discuss further
this issue," a State Department spokesman said.

to U.S. President Bill Clinton to ease the U.S. sanctions against
the DPRK as a way to stabilize the situation on the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.S. delegation was expected to be led
by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charles Kartman, and
would also include officials of the National Security Council and

</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they did not expect the meeting to lift
sanctions at least right now.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-Year ESAF Credit for Kirgizstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) announced here Monday the approval of a new three-year
credit for Kirgizstan under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF), in an amount of about 86 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The concessional credit will be used to support the
government's economic program for 1998-2000. The first annual
loan, equivalent to about 29 million dollars, is available in two
equal semiannual installments, the first of which is available
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The new three-year program backed by the ESAF aims at a steady
output growth, a permanent reduction in inflation to single-digit
levels, and a strengthening of the external position. Fiscal
tightening and retrenchment will be the centerpiece of the
program.
</P>
<P>
The economic program for 1998 and 1999 is targeted at real GDP
growth of about 6 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively,
end-of-period inflation of 12 percent and 8 percent, respectively,
and an external current account deficit of about 7.5 percent of
GDP and 6.9 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Kirgiz Republic joined the IMF in May, 1992. Its quota is
about 86 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing
currently totals 157 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Regional Conference Begins on Combating Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Romania is open to cooperation
of any kind, apt to contribute to combating drug trafficking and
abuse, stressed Romanian President Emil Constantinescu in a
message addressed Monday to a regional conference on combating
drug smuggling and consumption, held in Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
He said that Romania wishes to closely correlate its foreign
policy with the international efforts aimed at achieving a
security architecture in its zone.
</P>
<P>
The message added that the changes that took place in the
South-East European countries after 1989 have enlarged cooperation
at various levels increased the risk of cross-border organized
crime, with drug production, trafficking and illegal intake as a
component playing a negative but very active role.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu called for cooperation to diminish this world
scourge by exchanging information, taking tangible actions,
training specialists and supplying adequate means to fight
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
The regional conference on combating drug smuggling and
consumption started Monday in Bucharest, the conference attended
by officials from similar institutions in Bulgaria, Greece,
Turkey, Hungary, Ukraine, Moldova, as well as of the International
Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), the U.S. Justice
Department and the U.N. Program on Drugs Control.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Romanian Anti-Corruption and Organized Crime
Brigade Calin Mateescu said Romania represented a quasi-obligatory

<HEADLINE> Alderdice to Be First N.Irish Assembly Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Lord Alderdice is set to become the
first speaker of the new Northern Ireland Assembly just hours
after he quit as leader of the Alliance Party following 11 years
in the job.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Bi yowlam announced the appointment
Monday, saying Lord Alderdice's "political and parliamentary
experience means that he is well suited to carry out this role."
</P>
<P>
He will be known officially as the Presiding Officer in the new
body which meets for the first time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One of the first tasks of the Assembly will be to decide if
they want Lord Alderdice to take on the position on a permanent
basis.
</P>
<P>
Alderdice's non-partisan Alliance Party draws support from both
the Protestant and Roman Catholic nationalist communities in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Alderdice said he was resigning as leader of the party because
he won only six seats in the 108-chamber instead of his goal of
between eight and 10, meaning it failed to win a seat in its
12-member cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Alderdice was a central figure in protracted peace talks that
created an accord which led to the elections and his decision
stunned politicians and commentators.
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized he would continue to represent Alliance in
the House of Lords, Britain's upper parliamentary tier, and as a
member of the new assembly.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott has held "constructive" talks with Pakistan Foreign
Secretary Shamshad Ahmed, the State Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions were constructive on both of our countries's
concerns about nonproliferation and the general situation in South
Asia," spokesman Lee McClenny told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting was part of the strong U.S. interest in
keeping lines of communication open with both India and Pakistan,
particularly in the wake of the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"We don't wish to isolate either country," he added.
</P>
<P>
McClenny said the United States would continue to talk with
Pakistan and with India to try to lessen tensions in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to keep our channels of communication open," he
said. "AS long as we're having good communication, that's good
enough for us."
</P>
<P>
McClenny also said the United States would exempt sales of
wheat from sanctions, imposed upon India and Pakistan since their
nuclear tests last month, as "they would fall into the area of
humanitarian assistance."

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Beat Yugoslavia 2-1 in Thrillering Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TOULOUSE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands and Yugoslavia
played an exciting and classic World Cup game and the Dutch
prevailed 2-1 in the last minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch team enjoyed a total advantage in the first half when
the Yugoslavians were not aggressive enough and let the Netherlands
take control of the midfield.
</P>
<P>
Striker Dennis Bergkamp nearly broke the deadlock at the 22nd
minute but his shot was punched out by Yugoslav goal-keeper Ivica
Kralj.
</P>
<P>
Kralj continued to display his splendid saves in the match but
Bergkamp tested him again at the 38th minute and this time the Dutch
striker succeeded with a right-footer to put the Netherlands 1-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
The first 20 minutes of the second half saw a different story. The
Yugoslav team came back into the match strongly and Slobodan
Komljenovic headed home a free-kick from Dragan Stojkovic at the
48th minute.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, Vladimir Jugovic created another scoring chance
for the Yugoslav team when he was fouled by Dutch defender Jaap Stam
and got awarded a penalty shot.
</P>
<P>
But star midfielder Predrag Mijatovic shot the ball to crossbar.
It was the first missed penalty shot in the France'98 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch team were obviously relieved by the narrow escape and
built up their confidence again. As the Yugoslavians getting more
tired in the last 15 minutes, the Dutch team resumed their advantage.
</P>
<P>
But the Yugoslavia team held on and managed to keep the 1-1
score to the last minutes of the match. Kralj put up another two
great saves but failed to block the third one -- a fierce left-foot
shot by Edgar Davids just out of the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
The goal was the last straw to the exhausted Yugoslavia team and
they could not even launch another attack after the goal.
</P>
<P>
The hard-fought victory put the Netherlands into the
quarter-finals. Their opponents will be the winners of the match
between Argentina and England at Saint-Etienne on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Appointed New COMESA Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Erastus Mwencha of Kenya has been
appointed as new Secretary-General of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba the outgoing COMESA Chairman, announced Monday in
Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the leaders attending the third COMESA
Summit in Kinshasa unanimously agreed Sunday night to appoint
Mwencha to replace Bingu Muthapika of Malawi, according to the
Pan-African News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Bingu was suspended in January 1997 for alleged impropriety at
the Lusaka COMESA Secretariat and later quitted.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha had been acting Secretary-General since the suspension
of Bingu.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement of his appointment, Mwencha said: "I
feel humbled that the countries have invested in me such a
challenging task in spite of the so many people who are qualified
out there and maybe much better. I do not want to assume it is
an appointment that one would merit in any way."
</P>
<P>
He said immediate task will be to ensure that the organization
will establish a free trade area by the year 2000, in order to
guarantee the free movement of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
COMESA member countries have agreed to reduce customs tariffs
by 90 percent in October this year and 100 percent by October
2000 to achieve a zero rate. However, eight of the 20 member
countries have not yet implemented the decision.
</P>
<P>
"The tasks ahead is daunting for the region but one feels
compelled it has to be done. I have been in the job and I know
the challenges that COMESA faces," Mwencha said.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Scrap Travel Visa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) will scrap travel
visa by the year 2000 to promote trade within the member
countries.
</P>
<P>
This was decided by the COMESA member countries at the third
COMESA Summit in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
"With the complete abolition of restrictions to the internal
movements of goods under the COMESA free trade area by the year
2000, there would be greater need for business persons to move
freely within COMESA," a report from the COMESA Council of
Ministers said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the scrapping of travel visa will also
accelerate the process of integration by removing any barriers to
the free movement of goods and factors of production.
</P>
<P>
COMESA has also agreed to mobilize about 300 million U.S.
Dollars to build its telecommunications interconnectivity
network.

<HEADLINE> Three-Century-Old London Tea Auction Closes Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- London's tea auction, one of the
oldest traditions in the financial city, closed Monday after
319-year history.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 tea brokers and onlookers crowded into a
conference room at the London Chamber of Commerce for an emotional
farewell at the auction of the last 400 tons of tea.
</P>
<P>
The 50-minute auction was a nostalgic occasion, but with many
of the lots on offer failing to sell it illustrated clearly
London's declining role as a tea auction center.
</P>
<P>
The auction has been overtaken by technology and the increasing
globalization of the tea market. Rival auctions have sprung up
around the world and more and more buyers are using new methods of
communication, such as the internet or fax, to trade tea.
</P>
<P>
Ever since 1,679 tea buyers have gathered on a weekly basis. By
the 1950s a third of all the world's tea was bought through the
auction.
</P>
<P>
But auctions have been in steady decline in recent decades.
This year they have been held every two weeks, due to lack of
volume. Now less than 8 percent of the tea drunk in Britain is
sold under the hammer.
