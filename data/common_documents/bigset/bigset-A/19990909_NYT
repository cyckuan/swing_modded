TROJANS AGREE TO SERIES WITH VIRGINIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC has reached a tentative agreement with
Virginia to play a home-and-home series in the 2001 and 2002
seasons. The Trojans would host Virginia on Sept. 1, 2001, at the
Coliseum, then play the Cavaliers in Charlottesville on Sept. 7,
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia will sign the contract as soon as it receives
assurances that the 2001 game will be played at or before 1 p.m. in
Los Angeles. The Cavaliers have a road game the following week and
do not want to get back to Virginia so late that they would need to
take Sunday off.
</P>
<P>
   USC hopes the game will be regionally televised by ABC, which
would mean a 12:30 p.m. kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   __ Small body, big hitter: Perhaps the most unheralded debut
against Hawaii came from freshman Troy Polamalu, who had four
tackles, including a sack and forced fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Polamalu moved to linebacker less than two weeks ago and wasn't
sure if he would make the adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really small,'' Polamalu said. ``Butting heads with those
big, old linemen, the comparison is obvious. I was really
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he got on the field, however, Polamalu showed that he has a
knack for making plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt really good to get out there. But it's hard to back
somebody up as good as Markus Steele,'' he said. ``I've moved all
over the defense, but I'm trying to help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Polamalu made one other adjustment in the Hawaii game. After
never playing before more than 500 fans in his hometown of
Roseburg, Ore., he performed in front of 50,000 at Aloha Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go in front of 50,000 is unthinkable,'' he said. ``I never
could have imagined how good it felt to be running out in front of
all those people.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ford tough: Former tight end Lonnie Ford had one of the
defense's best performances against Hawaii in his first game at
defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazing thing is he hasn't played defensive line in two
years,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``He knew he was a natural
there. I believe Lonnie's going to be a force.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who had two sacks, three tackles and a forced fumble, said
Hawaii concentrated more on linemen Ennis Davis and Sultan
Abdul-Malik.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real surprised how I played,'' Ford said. ``I thought
they would take advantage of me because I'm a new person. I think I
just showed people what I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford is starting ahead of sophomore Kori Dickerson, and when
suspended lineman Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed returns to action,
he'll play the opposite side behind Matt Childers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sick bay: R. Jay Soward missed his second straight day of
practice with what has been termed ``food poisoning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have also been hit by the flu, with linemen Eric
Denmon and Nate Steinbacher also out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a game, it would be a real problem,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rideaux might return: Hackett said that cornerback Darrell
Rideaux might practice Sunday. Rideaux remains out with a back
injury.
</P>
<P>
   __ Oregon time: USC's game with Oregon on Sept. 25 is expected
to have a 7 p.m. kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   __ Medical center visit: The football team will visit patients
at USC University Hospital, USC/Norris Cancer Center and Los
Angeles County-USC Medical Center on Friday. There will also be a
public rally in the main quad at noon featuring the team, band and
song leaders.

JUDGE WINS APPOINTMENT TO U.S. DISTRICT COURT OF WESTERN
WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON AND JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly to
confirm King County Superior Court Judge Marsha Pechman to a
lifetime appointment on the U.S. District Court of Western
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Pechman, 48, was recommended by a panel named by Washington
Sens. Slade Gorton and Patty Murray, and nominated by President
Clinton in March.
</P>
<P>
   She will replace Judge William Dwyer, an influential jurist
suffering from the early stages of Parkinson's disease who wants to
take the semi-retired status of a senior judge and work part-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that it has concluded,'' Pechman said. ``I've
already said that (Dwyer's) are big shoes to fill. I will have to
create my own shoes, but he has done a wonderful job of guidance
and in having a sterling career to follow as a role model.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote to confirm Pechman was 93-1. Sen. Bob Smith,
Independent of New Hampshire, did not return a call to explain his
vote against Pechman's confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Pechman, a survivor of breast cancer, has tackled tough matters
during her decade on the Superior Court, and led a project to
improve how civil cases are handled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, she ruled the state's malicious harassment law, aimed
at protecting people from hate crimes, was unconstitutionally broad
and could have a chilling effect on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Pechman rejected a legal move to block the gathering of
signatures for two anti-gay-rights ballot measures, calling the
initiative process a ``precious right.''
</P>
<P>
   She presided over a recent, tumultuous trial in which a Seattle
man, DeWayne Harris, was found guilty on three counts of
first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   After profane outbursts by the defendant, Pechman banished
Harris from the courtroom and made him watch the trial on
closed-circuit TV. When Harris testified, he was strapped in a
security restraint chair.
</P>
<P>
   Pechman is an Oregon native who received her undergraduate
degree from Cornell University and her law degree from Boston
University. While still in law school, she worked as a law clerk in
the state attorney general's office under Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   Her career has included stints as a deputy King County
prosecutor, a professor at the law schools of the University of
Washington and the University of Puget Sound, both in Seattle, and
a partner at the Seattle law firm of Levinson, Friedman, Vhugen,
Duggan, Bland and Horowitz.
</P>
<P>
   As a prosecutor, Pechman handled criminal cases; as a teacher,
she specialized in criminal defense, and in private practice, she
specialized in personal injury litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Booth Gardner appointed Pechman to the King
County Superior Court in 1988, and she was elected to the post,
without opposition, in 1988, 1992 and 1996. She has heard both
civil and criminal cases, serves on a variety of ethics advisory
committees, and has pushed to speed up trials by more rapidly
selecting juries and changing the ways in which court calendars are
managed.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer said Wednesday he intends to take time off and then return
to the bench and work part-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Marsha Pechman is going to be a first-rate federal
judge in every way,'' said Dwyer, who has maintained a full
caseload pending confirmation of his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near term, I will keep some cases that would be very
difficult to transfer, such as the current forest litigation,''
Dwyer said. ``The balance of cases, I will transfer to Judge
Pechman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Dwyer has emerged as one of the nation's
most influential federal judges. His rulings and opinions helped
guide federal courts on subjects ranging from the Endangered
Species Act to term limits for federal elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer was in the news again recently with an opinion that halted
nine federal timber sales and put about 200 more in jeopardy. He
criticized the U.S. Forest Service for failing to look carefully
enough for protected plants and animals before taking bids from
timber companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pechman's nomination was the product of an unusual agreement
between Gorton and Murray to jointly propose judicial nominees from
the state. Although in many states the president takes names only
from the senator of his own party, Gorton, a Republican, had
threatened to block Senate confirmation of judges from Washington
state unless he was granted a role in proposing nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton hailed Pechman as ``a first-rate nomination,'' and said
that by listening to the Gorton-Murray panel, ``the president has
therefore engaged fully in the normal advice and consent process
for the choosing of federal judges for this vitally important
lifetime position.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray was also pleased with the Senate action, saying of
Pechman, ``everyone who knows her or has worked with her admires
her a great deal, and I believe she will do an outstanding job as a
federal judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., praised Pechman as ``outstanding,''
but bemoaned the Senate's slow pace of approving nominees this
year, saying that ``we are not doing our job, we are not being
responsible, we are really being dishonest and condescending and
arrogant toward the judiciary.'' As of Sept. 1, there were 69
vacancies on the federal bench, including seven on the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is pleased that the Senate has confirmed such a
qualified candidate and hopes the Judiciary Committee will continue
to review the many pending nominees so that they too may have a
vote,'' said Clinton spokeswoman Elizabeth Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton and Murray also have agreed on two pending appointments
to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals _ Ron Gould, former state bar
association president, and Richard Tallman, former head of the
white-collar criminal defense section at Bogle &AMP; Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Gould's appointment has been pending for a year and has yet to
receive a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Tallman is
currently undergoing an FBI background check and evaluation by the
American Bar Association. The White House is expected soon to
formally send his nomination to the Senate.

 STUDY HALL ONLINE _ MANY WEB SITES HELP YOUNG SCHOLARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By HENRY NORR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
When kids sit down to work on school projects and papers this fall,
they might well head for the Internet rather than the library or
the textbook for information and assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Web sites offer ideas, images and advice that can
be useful to the young scholar. The trick is to find a few that
present accurate and up-to-date information in understandable
language and an appealing format _ and to avoid sites with
inappropriate content.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Web has spawned a slew of sites that attempt to
solve that problem. Most consist mainly of link lists and search
tools that point kids to other sites with high-quality and
age-appropriate educational material. Some of these sites even
promise personal answers, on the Web or via e-mail, to students'
questions.
</P>
<P>
   And in the spirit of the Internet, the homework help sites
typically offer their services for free, relying on banner ads,
corporate subsidies or grants from universities or government
agencies to cover costs.
</P>
<P>
   Used wisely, these ``homework help'' sites can be a boon to
kids, parents and teachers, but they also raise some troubling
issues of ethics and equity.
</P>
<P>
   Child-oriented Web directories like KidsClick and Homework
Central are great starting points for young people looking for
background information about a specific topic. Like their grown-up
equivalents _ Yahoo, Excite, LookSmart and the rest _ they attempt
to bring order to the chaos of the Web by evaluating thousands of
sites and listing links to the best of them, organized by topic and
in some cases briefly annotated.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes the child-oriented directories from their
adult counterparts is that they encompass a much smaller subset of
the Web, selected for age-appropriateness and educational value.
</P>
<P>
   Most are also broken down, at least roughly, by grade level: The
first step in using Homework Central, for example, is to click on
icons labeled ``1st to 6th Grades,'' ``Middle &AMP; High School,'' or
``College and Beyond.'' KidsClick has a single, unified directory,
but all sites listed by topic and returned by the search engine
include a reading-level rating as well as a short summary.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these sites are simply junior versions of destinations
popular among adults: Yahooligans, for example, is a branch of
Yahoo, while Ask Jeeves for Kids, not surprisingly, is based on the
popular Ask Jeeves site, which lets users pose questions in plain
English and attempts to respond with useful answers and links.
</P>
<P>
   Other children's directories and search sites were created from
the ground up by librarians and educators, often with support from
major academic institutions. KidsClick, for instance, is now housed
at a facility run by the University of California at Berkeley, with
support from Sun Microsystems, but it was started by librarians at
the Ramapo Catskill Library System in New York State. Another major
directory, called the Internet Public Library, began in a graduate
seminar in the School of Information and Library Studies at the
University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, B.J. Pinchbeck's Homework Helper site was
created in 1996 by a 9-year-old _ with an unspecified degree of
assistance from his father.
</P>
<P>
   Question-and-Answer Sites
</P>
<P>
   More innovative, and in some ways problematic, are the sites
that respond directly to student inquiries. The largest and the
oldest of these is a section of America Online, available only to
the service's subscribers, that's called Ask-A-Teacher. More than
half a million children use the service, posting an average of
10,000 questions per day, according to AOL. Replies come from some
1,300 volunteer teachers and specialists, of whom 40 percent have
Ph.D.s and 80 percent at least a Master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   Most questions and answers are posted on the Ask-A-Teacher
message boards, which are organized by school subject and grade
level, and students are encouraged to search the boards to see
whether their question has already been asked before posting a new
one _ a suggestion that seems to be often ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Students also can seek direct assistance via e-mail or, at
certain hours, attempt to get into special chat rooms where
teachers provide personal tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   Another pioneer in the personal-response category is a site
called Ask Dr. Math, which was launched in 1994 by a professor and
several students at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. Today, it
is supported by the National Science Foundation and receives
between 5,000 and 6,000 questions per month, according to Stacey
Bearden, its 22-year-old project coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Some 250 volunteers from all over the world, including students,
teachers and people from private industry, provide responses by
e-mail; questions and answers are then compiled into a searchable
database. Before being allowed to join the Dr. Math team,
volunteers go through an extended period of evaluation and
training, according to Bearden. Until certified they can post
responses only to a ``holding tank'' accessible only to staff
members, who then offer critiques of their work.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in part inspired by Dr. Math's example, scores of
academics in other disciplines and numerous government agencies
have set up similar sites. In fact, there are now so many of them
that at least two Web sites _ Pitsco's Ask An Expert and the
Virtual Reference Desk's Ask A+ Locator _ are devoted to listing
them. Some, like the zany MAD Scientist Network, enlist the
contributions of hundreds of scientists in a variety of fields.
Others, like the Ask a Ballistic Parachute Expert and Ask an
Antarctic Expert, involve a solitary volunteer or at most a small
team.
</P>
<P>
   The people responsible for these sites insist that their goal is
not to give kids answers, but to help them analyze problems and
find material so they can complete their assignments for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, however, is sometimes more complicated. While
direct answers rarely if ever appear in responses from Ask Dr.
Math, the same can't be said of another math-assistance site,
Webmath.
</P>
<P>
   At Webmath, it's not human volunteers, but a software engine
that responds to queries students post. The site provides forms for
entering problems ranging from simple arithmetic to advanced
algebra, geometry and even calculus. Once the student has filled in
the form, the Webmath computers proceed to solve it, putting up
step-by-step explanations but ultimately delivering the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a number, an algebraic expression or a graph, the
student can easily copy and paste it electronically, or simply copy
it the old-fashioned way onto a homework paper.
</P>
<P>
   Even at sites with dedicated human volunteers, students don't
always seem to understand or accept the notion that they should do
the work themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the teacher-student dialogues archived at the homework
help site run by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, for example, and at
AOL's Ask-A-Teacher area consist of students posing a problem and
asking for the answer (sometimes with pleas like ``I need this
right away''); volunteer teachers responding with suggestions about
ways to analyze the problem or sources to consult; and students
then replying with another request for the answer.
</P>
<P>
   In AOL's sixth-grade math message board this week, for example,
a user named Littlebrats1255 posted a query consisting, in its
entirety, of ``whats 1225+8527.'' A volunteer teacher replied with
an earnest suggestion about lining up the problem properly and
remembering to carry. But then someone else replied with a message
reading simply ``9,752.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the help sites don't provide direct answers, the ease
with which students can copy and paste material from the Web into
their papers raises issues that trouble some educators (see
sidebar).
</P>
<P>
   Others worry about the reliability of the information students
find or receive from anonymous volunteers. (The Chronicle has
visited all the sites mentioned in this story and the accompanying
chart, and although they all appear to be of high quality and
reputability, we can't guarantee that students will never come away
with incorrect information.)
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of HOMEWK09 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Some educators and parents also note that the Web, even while
making more information available to students than ever before,
also presents them with more distractions than traditional sources.
Homework sites that carry ads say they filter them carefully for
age-appropriateness, but some slips are probably inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Last week an About.com page of links to sites that explain
English grammar, for example, also carried a banner ad reading
``Jennifer Lopez's Abundant Butt.'' The ad was actually for a story
at Salon.com, and its relatively high-brow content probably
wouldn't cause offense to anyone. But it's easy to imagine an
adolescent boy choosing to check out that story in preference to
one about the nature of adverbs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of situations like that, even educators who appreciate
the value of homework help sites advocate that parents and teachers
keep a close eye on kids using them. Cathy Spaulding, a mother of
three from British Columbia who administers About.com's
fast-growing Homework Help pages, including the grammar page that
carried the Salon ad, said she believes that parents, even of
high-school kids, should always be nearby when their children go
online.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Lovelace, expanded learning coordinator for the San
Francisco Unified School District, noted another concern about
homework help sites: They give yet another advantage to students
whose families can afford home computers and Internet access and
thereby indirectly penalize the children of poorer families.
``That's very much a concern to us,'' she said. ``That's exactly
why we think our program is so important, because it's the only way
a lot of these kids can take advantage of what's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Programs like the San Francisco district's don't solve the whole
equity issue, of course, but there is some evidence that, together
with public-access computers in libraries, they may be having some
effect. About.com's Spaulding said that about 60 percent of those
visiting her help guides do so from home, but 25 percent do so from
public libraries and an additional 15 percent from school
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Dr. Math project manager Bearden had a different twist on
the equity issue: ``Don't forget,'' she said, ``some kids have
access to the Net but not to good teachers. In that case we're
actually an equalizer.''

PITCHER GAGNE THE EXCEPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ While the Los Angeles Dodgers continued to glow about
the Tuesday debut of right-hander Eric Gagne, the truth is most
pitchers like Gagne never get to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne, expected to be the organization's pitcher of the year,
originally was slated to be a closer after pitching in that role
for the Canadian National team.
</P>
<P>
   It is common that relief pitchers are starters throughout their
minor-league careers.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne, who will start Sunday against the New York Mets at Dodger
Stadium, went the other way. The Montreal native signed after going
undrafted in late 1995 and quickly showed he had the makeup to be a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the minors, the starters are the high draft choices and top
prospects,'' manager Davey Johnson said after watching Gagne limit
Florida to two hits and no runs in six innings on Tuesday. ``If you
are not drafted or drafted very low, you head to the bullpen. Few
ever make it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagne's development was further sidetracked in 1997 when he tore
a ligament in his right elbow that required reconstructive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Tommy John'' surgery now is so common that some
baseball people actually consider it a helpful tool to a pitcher's
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It often turns throwers into pitchers, which is a huge step,''
Johnson said. ``When I had (Cleveland closer) Mike Jackson, he had
the reconstructive surgery. We told him, `Don't throw the slider,
just fastballs.' In time he learned to throw different speeds and
got it to tail, too. It really helped make him the pitcher he is
today.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending 1998 at Class-A Vero Beach, Gagne's career really
took off this season. He was the Texas League Pitcher of the Year
with a 12-4 record and 2.63 ERA. He led the league with 185
strikeouts, was second in ERA and third in victories.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne was not only impressive on the mound, he became fluent in
English after speaking only French just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne wears glasses on the mound but not at the plate. He has an
astigmatism and without glasses cannot judge the distance to home
plate, he said after throwing six scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne said he wears the glasses because he has scar tissue in
his eyes from a hockey injury. He said he nearly quit baseball
while sitting out in 1997 and went back to hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I didn't,'' he said. ``This is so much fun. Last
night was everything I ever thought it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Antonio Osuna, who is throwing 93 mph again
after doctors told him he needed reconstructive surgery on his
right elbow, returns to the Dodgers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bullpen help: Left-hander Jeff Williams, whose contract was
purchased Tuesday, will get some work out of the bullpen the rest
of the way. Williams started and relieved at Triple-A Albuquerque
and was 9-7 with a 5.02 ERA. The Dodgers are considering sending
left-handed reliever Onan Masaoka back to the minors next season to
convert him into a starter.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Williams on the 40-man roster, the Dodgers
placed left-hander Carlos Perez (bruised right leg) on the 60-day
disabled list. They also have Osuna on the 60-day DL, ``which gives
us the flexibility of 42 guys on the 40-man roster,'' Johnson said.

   Western Athletic Conference officials hold a coaches conference
call once a week, a chance for football coaches to talk about games

   ``I have read the rumors, but I don't know what is and what
isn't accurate,'' Hawaii coach June Jones said when asked about the
possible departure of TCU and SMU. ``Something better will come
along for Hawaii if they do or if they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   WAC commissioner Karl Benson has been talking to his six
for-sure schools _ Rice, UT-El Paso, Tulsa, Hawaii, San Jose State
and Fresno State _ and the consensus seems to be to let TCU and SMU
go. That's not to say a backup plan hasn't been considered, with
North Texas, Louisiana Tech, Boise State and Idaho among the
programs being tossed around as possible WAC additions. Benson said
he has been contacted by some of those schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think we need to be prudent in determining what our
course of action would be if forced to,'' Benson said. ``We have
not established a contingency plan.''
</P>
<P>
   If TCU and SMU bolt for C-USA, look for Mountain West Conference
officials to take a good look at WAC member Fresno State. Of
course, the Mountain West's membership began Benson's nightmare in
May 1998 by breaking away from the 16-team WAC. Folks in the
eight-team Mountain West stated a desire to expand last spring. The
only reason that Mountain West officials haven't called Fresno
State yet? Conference officials are waiting for rogue men's
basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian leaves. QUICK HITS
</P>
<P>
   WAC teams went 3-5 in the opening week of football. In the only
crossover game between the WAC and the former WACs, UTEP defeated
New Mexico, 13-10, winning one for the new WAC. ``We really
outplayed them,'' Miners coach Charlie Bailey said. ``The score
should've been more than it was.'' ... Just in case anybody was
looking, C-USA had a good weekend, with East Carolina defeating
West Virginia, 30-23, and Louisville crunching Kentucky, 56-28. ...
SMU boasted a crowd of 51,019 for Saturday's game against Arkansas.
Only bad news was that probably 40,000 of them were Razorbacks
fans. ... SMU's defense played well in the 26-0 loss, holding
Arkansas to four touchdowns. SMU's offense? Did it even play?
``When you don't score any points, you don't have much to talk
about on offense,'' Mustangs coach Mike Cavan said. ... Hawaii's
losing streak is 19 and counting after a 62-7 loss against Southern
California on Saturday. ...
</P>
<P>
   Look for Rice coach Ken Hatfield to spend a good portion of
practice having his team work on holding onto the football. Rice
had eight fumbles against Houston, losing five. ... Rice's schedule
only gets harder, too, with Michigan on Saturday followed by a trip
to play Texas. ... Tulsa has a tall task this weekend, traveling to
Stillwater, Okla., to play Oklahoma State. Tulsa hasn't won in
Stillwater since 1951. ``I've been trying to break that streak
since 1976,'' Golden Hurricane coach Dave Rader said. ... Fresno
State quarterback Billy Volek (200 yards passing, four touchdowns
in a victory against Portland State) is the WAC offensive player of
the week, and UTEP defensive end Brian Young (eight tackles and a
sack against New Mexico) is the defensive player of the week. ``I
just think Brian Young is the best defensive player in the WAC,''
Bailey said. ``There is no doubt about it. They couldn't block him
all night long.''...
</P>
<P>
   TCU's next game at Amon Carter Stadium in Fort Worth, Texas,
comes Oct. 9 against San Jose State, hardly a pushover. Louisiana
State narrowly escaped San Jose State, 29-21, on Saturday. Yet, the
focus of San Jose State coach Dave Baldwin remained on the possible
departures of TCU and SMU. ``As a coach, it is frustrating to make
a commitment and to say, ``This is the conference and who we are
going to play,' '' Spartans coach Dave Baldwin said. ``And if it
changed again like there is talk, it's frustrating to boosters and
myself as a coach.'' nn

A LOT OF BLAME TO SHOULDER IN BOULDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere in Seattle on Saturday night was the happiest coach
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Washington coach Rick Neuheisel hadn't coached a game yet, but
you can bet he was savoring Colorado State's 41-14 thumping of his
former employer, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Colorado like a scoundrel in the midst of its
biggest recruiting weekend _ and in the opinion of many,
dismantling a once-powerful program _ Neuheisel was no doubt
thrilled to see the Buffaloes stumble.
</P>
<P>
   But where does this leave new Buffs coach Gary Barnett, who is
trying to clean up this mess?
</P>
<P>
   Barnett said quarterback Mike Moschetti's game-week comment to a
Denver television crew should have raised a red flag. Moschetti
said Nebraska was Colorado's rival and not Colorado State, a sound
bite that played nicely in Fort Collins.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing that, Barnett believes he ``should have been more
perceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Moschetti, however, said his coach merely sought to shoulder
responsibility: ``I said it last year, and we went out and beat
(Colorado State) up pretty good. . . . I think we knew it was a big
game. It's the first game of the season. We didn't execute. He's
not playing, we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss has led to much soul-searching in Boulder. Colorado's
defense tackled poorly, failed to shed blocks and lined up wrong on
eight plays.
</P>
<P>
   Most puzzling to Barnett was why his team reacted with almost
complete surprise to Colorado State's offensive and defensive
schemes. Barnett said his position coaches and coordinators have to
``sit down and talk to players and determine why we had trouble
handling what we prepared for, then find out if we have any
inadequacies in our offensive and defensive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's probably commonplace to stand here and say, `Well,
we'll just move on to the next game.' But it won't be that easy. We
have to find out why this happened. It's going to hurt a lot _ as
it should _ and it will. I'm fully aware of that. We have to assess
everything that happened. You just can't write it off as a bad day
at the office. . . . We need to feel the hurt. Maybe that'll drive
home a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, Colorado's players had to leave the field
through a tunnel and were pelted with debris. Denver police in riot
gear first sprayed fans hanging over the mouth of the tunnel, then
tossed a couple of canisters of tear gas into the stands. At least
two canisters were tossed back onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   __ Unusual punishment: Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary coached
his team against Navy from the press box. Not because he wanted to
but because he had to.
</P>
<P>
   This was part of the NCAA's punishment for O'Leary providing an
improper loan to former Tech running back C.J. Williams. He was
also barred from Tech's final spring scrimmage and could not
recruit off campus in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong. I shouldn't have done what I did,'' O'Leary said.
``I thought it was over with, but it's still here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we have seven ecstatic coaches and three coaches who
are down in the dumps because they found out I was going upstairs
(with them). The coaches down on the field feel pretty good about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Scott drops: Neuheisel named true freshman Cody Pickett as
Washington's backup quarterback, ahead of third-year sophomore J.K.
Scott of Burroughs High.
</P>
<P>
   During training camp Scott was having trouble with the
center-quarterback exchange and was benched during one scrimmage in
favor of Pickett. Scott has said he won't transfer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Beaver fever: Oregon State brought nearly 7,000 fans _ about
10 times its usual traveling party _ to its victory over Nevada in
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Season-ticket sales are at a record 10,600, and officials are
expecting a crowd of nearly 30,000 (capacity is 35,362) for
Saturday's game against Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   Even stranger, the Beavers have won eight straight nonconference
games and could be 3-0 when they play USC on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   __ Boller update: Former Hart quarterback Kyle Boller entered
his first college game for Cal to the chants of his name from the
student section, then promptly fumbled on his first play.
</P>
<P>
   Boller completed his first pass attempt, a bullet to Ronnie
Davenport that covered 26 yards. Boller hit on his first five
attempts for 60 yards and a touchdown, then was 3 for 10
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who would start vs. Nebraska, Cal coach Tom Holmoe said:
``It'll probably be Sam (Clemons), but Kyle will play, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite it being Boller's first game he wasn't shy about taking
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Senior center John Romero recalled this scene when Boller
returned to the huddle during at the end of a timeout: ``The guys
were all talking in the huddle. He came in and said, `Everybody
quiet down.' Then he called the play and told the receivers to be
sure to hold onto the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The Little Ten: When Miami knocked off Ohio State in the
Kickoff Classic, it extended an interesting streak. The Big Three
in the state of Florida (Miami, Florida State, Florida) are 16-0
against the Big Ten going back to the 1987 season. This includes
games against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Point guard vs. point guard: When Indiana plays North
Carolina on Saturday, two unique athletes will be in the spotlight.
Both quarterbacks _ Indiana sophomore Antwaan Randle El and North
Carolina sophomore Ronald Curry _ also play point guard for their
college teams during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lateral career move: New Northwestern coach Randy Walker
might regret his decision to take the job after the Wildcats' 28-3
loss to Miami of Ohio. Walker coached Miami for nine years before
replacing Gary Barnett in January. &UR; SCOTT WOLF'S TOP 10 &LR;  &QL;

 MARINEAU COULD BRING FIZZ TO FADED LEVI'S
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CAROL EMERT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Soda pop to blue jeans _ that's the transition
Philip Marineau must make if he is to turn around troubled Levi
Strauss &AMP; Co. But does the respected soft drink executive have the
right material to run a clothing company in San Francisco?
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell if Marineau, who takes the helm of Levi's
later this month, can accomplish what a team of veteran Levi's
executives have failed to do: burnish the 146-year-old brand and
reverse a trend of sliding sales that is now moving into its third
year.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring a packaged-goods specialist for a job in the clubby rag
trade isn't as wacky as it might seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``A consumer products person is exactly the kind of person you
would expect Levi's to recruit,'' said Hal Reiter, president of
Herbert Mines Associates, a New York headhunter specializing in
retail. ``Levi's needs to reinvent itself and beverage companies
are continually reinventing themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi's said in January, when it announced its executive search,
that it would look beyond the apparel industry for candidates _ and
its strategy is hardly unprecedented. In fact, big consumer product
companies tend to be incubators for heavy-hitting marketing
executives.
</P>
<P>
   John Sculley, former chief executive of Apple Inc., was
recruited from PepsiCo, where Marineau just spent two years as head
of North American operations. Paul Charron, the chief executive of
Liz Claiborne, did a previous stint at Proctor &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``For brand rebuilding, which is very much Levi's challenge
right now, someone with that kind of background is the right person
to have,'' said retail consultant Isaac Lagnado, who has also
worked for PepsiCo.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Marineau ``has to have the right network of account
people to work directly with department store and specialty store
clients, because that is very much a who-do-you-know business,''
Lagnado said.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with Marineau's work at Pepsi, and his prior 23
years at Quaker Oats Co., describe him as a quick study who is
expected to pick up the ins and outs of Levi's global
casual-clothing empire without too much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau has only one major blemish on his record. Quaker
acquired Snapple in 1994, when Marineau was Quaker's president and
chief operating officer. Sales of Snapple plummeted after the
purchase, and Quaker ended up selling the beverage-maker.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's decision-makers were concerned about the Snapple debacle,
but became convinced that Marineau was not at fault _ at least not
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Snapple business was clearly executed very poorly ... and
on that score, there was probably a reasonable amount of blame to
go around'' among Quaker executives, said one Levi's insider.
</P>
<P>
   However, Marineau's stellar performance on other brands made up
for the Snapple snafu, this person said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Marineau's strongest selling points was his recent
introduction of Pepsi One. Although that line has achieved a
relatively small following, combined with Diet Pepsi it has given
PepsiCo a slight market share edge over Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau's Pepsi One experience appealed to Levi's executives as
they try to juggle a myriad of old and new brands and sub-brands _
including 501 jeans, Dockers, Slates and the European, nerdy-hip,
polyester STA-PREST line.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus is Marineau's ability to build strong and effective
management teams, said people familiar with his work. A lack of
strong leadership is considered one of Levi's most serious
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Already Marineau has shown a willingness to work with the
current team by refusing to put Levi's advertising account in
review.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's ads, created by TBWA/Chiat Day, have received mixed
reviews, but Marineau said, ``I think agencies are only as good as
the clients they serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Marineau also is known for building strong relationships with
business partners. Levi's has a long history of alienating its
retail partners, from department stores to specialty stores, with
late shipments and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Phil will bring the focus and accountability we need
to really be viewed as the supplier of choice once again,'' said
Robert Haas, who will remain Levi's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Haas said he is confident that Marineau will continue to run
Levi's in a progressive manner, while giving its inward-looking
corporate culture some new perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau already has a four-part plan in mind _ a plan that is
not notably different from one Levi's existing management has been
trying to execute.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to make sure Levi's is on top of fashion
trends and offers items to go with its famous bottoms, Marineau
said. The second is to improve the company's marketing and bring
cachet back to the brand. Third, improve the presentation of Levi's
merchandise in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, Marineau wants to toe a strict line on costs.
Restructuring costs this year have ballooned from an estimated $245
million to closer to $400 million, resulting in what is expected to
be Levi's first net loss in well over a decade.

 COMPUTER MAGAZINES SLUG IT OUT IN FURIOUS CONTEST FOR REVENUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAN FOST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the world of magazines, buzz is king. And in the computer
magazine arena, the buzz is with business ``books'' like the
Industry Standard, Business 2.0, Red Herring and Upside.
</P>
<P>
   But set those fat publications aside for a moment, because some
of the big daddies of tech publishing are fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the computer publishing industry, PC Magazine
and PC World saw their advertising pages take a dive in the past 18
months. But unlike such mags as Windows and Byte, which folded up
their print editions and exist solely on the Web, PC Magazine and
PC World are adding readers and duking it out for dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is hurting computer magazines in terms of advertising
sales, but not readership,'' said Jeff Edman, publisher of PC
World. ``Surprisingly, the Web seems to have a positive effect on
computer magazine readership, not a negative effect. ... As people
spend more time on the Web, as they spend more time interacting
with their computer, their need for computer magazines tends to go
up and not down.''
</P>
<P>
   Check out the numbers: Circulation is indeed up. PC Magazine
added about 52,000 readers from June 1998 to June 1999, for a total
of 1,227,799; PC World is breathing down its neck, adding nearly
77,000 readers to bring its total to 1,225,746.
</P>
<P>
   However, at the same time, ads are down. For the first six
months of this year, PC World ran 1,429 ad pages, a drop of nearly
11 percent from the 1,602 ad pages it ran in the same period last
year, according to Edman's figures. PC Magazine ran 2,607 pages
during the first half of this year, a drop of nearly 15 percent
from the prior year's 3,053 pages.
</P>
<P>
   According to Competitive Media Research, even though PC Magazine
lost hundreds of pages of ads last year, its total of 5,386 ad
pages for 1998 still put it at the top of all U.S. consumer
magazines. It had more ad pages than TV Guide, Time or GQ.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you rank the books on the ad sales game, it's been a
difficult 18 months,'' said PC Magazine Publisher and Senior Vice
President Peter Longo. He cited consolidation among computer
retailers, the Asian economic crisis and the growth of the Web as
major factors dragging down revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between PC Magazine and PC World is one of the flash
points of the competition between publishing giants Ziff-Davis and
International Data Group. Ziff, which is based in New York and is
publicly traded, owns the venerable PC Magazine, while privately
held IDG, based in Framingham, Mass., owns PC World.
</P>
<P>
   Both magazines were founded in San Francisco by serial
entrepreneur David Bunnell (now CEO of Upside), who sold them to
Ziff and IDG, respectively. PC Magazine is headquartered in New
York, while PC World remains based here.
</P>
<P>
   As the larger book, PC Magazine shrugs off PC World's challenge.
Longo said his magazine reaches more of the ``influencers'' who run
companies' e-business efforts and are therefore more desirable to
advertisers. But while Longo dismisses PC World as more ``consumer
oriented,'' Edman declares the ad and circulation numbers show that
``clearly the momentum seems to be with PC World.''
</P>
<P>
   Edman said the secret to PC World's growth is listening to its
readers. Every month for the past eight years, the magazine has
surveyed 350 readers about what they liked and didn't like in the
latest issue. One result: Each month it runs a ``top 100'' list of
reviews of the latest computers and gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   PC World's momentum marks only one storm on the seas ahead for
PC Magazine. For one thing, parent company Ziff-Davis is on the
block, and while Longo said it's ``business as usual,'' he wouldn't
comment on prospective buyers. (``I hear The Chronicle is buying
us,'' he joked.)
</P>
<P>
   For another, a revamping of the magazine is said to be under
way, which Longo also wouldn't discuss. He said only: ``PC
Magazine's editorial platform for lab-based competitive reviews has
remained the same for 15 years. It's served us well, through the
Windows magazine flurry to the Internet magazine flurry to the new
business magazine flurry. We make incremental changes to the
magazine with every issue and we will continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   VIVA VIACOM: At San Francisco's CBS MarketWatch.com, the deal to
merge the CBS television network into entertainment giant Viacom
was met with cheers this week.
</P>
<P>
   CBS holds a significant minority stake in MarketWatch, a
financial news site, and the network uses the Web site's reporters
both on television and radio. Thinking about all of Viacom's cable
interests, MarketWatch Editor in Chief Thom Calandra said, ``Can
you say, `MarketWatch on MTV?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our specialized reporting _ the world of business _ will be
very useful across Viacom's cable and other broadcast properties,''
Calandra said. ``This is the beginning of a very beautiful
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   MarketWatch is moving even more deeply into television,
launching a new show, CBS MarketWatch Weekend, on September 19. The
show will be followed by ads touting Calandra and other MarketWatch
writers, as CEO Larry Kramer seeks to build his company's brand.
</P>
<P>
   MarketWatch also will contribute to Bryant Gumbel's ``The Early
Show,'' debuting on CBS November 1.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, Kramer declares, are his Web victories. In an
interview in his office Wednesday, he crowed that MarketWatch's
news content is now listed on the Go network, the portal site owned
by the Walt Disney Co. _ parent of CBS rival ABC. ``We're even on
Snap, the NBC portal,'' Kramer said. ``I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the MarketWatch headlines are run on those sites
without one little icon: The CBS eye is missing.

 BEST SITES FOR STOCK RESEARCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID EINSTEIN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a Web site I can go to when researching a stock that
consolidates all recent news articles, analyst remarks, etc.? I'm
tired of going through the incredibly time-consuming task of
looking at all the individual sites such as Charles Schwab and
TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   A: A number of sites offer free basic information about public
companies, such as news, stock price and financial performance and
earnings estimates. Among the best I've found are Marketguide
(www.marketguide.com) and MSN's Money Central Investor
(www.investor.com). However, if you want research from analysts,
you're going to have to pay for it _ anywhere from $10 to $75 for a
report on a specific company. The leading site for that kind of
stuff is Multex.com (www.multex.com). They offer a free trial, so
you can check the service out before signing up.

   Pitching Porn
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am receiving four to six porn offers per day in my AOL
e-mail. Being a 60-year-old grandmother, I have no interest in
these offers. But I can't seem to figure out how to get off the
lists. I tried using AOL member services but can find no option for
stopping unwanted mail. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Join the crowd. Millions of America Online users _ including
me _ get porn pitches every day, along with lots of other
unsolicited offers for things like get-rich-quick schemes.
Unfortunately, there's not much you can do about it because AOL is
powerless to prevent spam. (That's Internetese for junk mail.) You
can use AOL's Mail Controls (keyword: mail controls) to block
messages from specific addresses or domains. But spammers get
around this by continually changing their addresses. And on top of
that, new spammers are appearing every day. If you feel like
registering a complaint, you can do so online (keyword: notify
AOL). Perhaps if enough people protest, AOL will get the message
and do something.

   Bookshelf Pirate
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I bought my new computer a few months ago, it didn't
come with Microsoft Office 97. Rather than buy the software, I
borrowed a CD from a friend and installed it. The problem is that I
want to use Bookshelf Basics but it's on one of the Office discs
that I didn't install. I don't want to borrow the software again.
So the question is, where can I find the Bookshelf software?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because you're a software thief, I probably shouldn't even be
answering your question. But I'll tell you what _ I'll help you out
if you promise not to install software from any more borrowed CDs.
The latest version of Bookshelf, called Bookshelf 2000, is
available as a stand-alone program that you can get for as little
as $15 after rebate. It includes a dictionary, a thesaurus, a book
of quotations, an almanac, an atlas and some other stuff. Once you
get it, use the dictionary to look up the word ``pirate'' and
you'll see a picture of yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Courtesy Copy
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a large organization of people to whom I wish to send
the same e-mail message (meeting schedules and time) several times
each month. Is there a way to do this so that people getting the
messages won't see the names of other recipients?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. Create a group in your e-mail address book for all the
people on your list. Then instead of sending messages to the group
using the To: box in your e-mail window, enter the name of the
group into the space for the BCC (blind courtesy copy) option. That
way, each recipient will see who sent the message but won't know
who else got it.

box that appears, click the button labeled Autosearch settings.
Then use the drop-down list to choose a search provider for address

Juvenile sex offenders' photos put on Internet 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEANNA BOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Posing for the camera, an 11-year-old
Arlington girl wears a big white bow, a polka-dot orange sweater
and a faint smile.
</P>
<P>
   This is no yearbook picture for her classmates to see. More
likely, the photograph will be viewed by their parents perusing the
Internet for registered sex offenders living in their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, now 12, is one of about 1,250 juveniles registered as
sex offenders in Texas. She was convicted of aggravated sexual
assault of a 5-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   A law that went into effect Sept. 1 gives the public access to
sex offenders' photographs and addresses, regardless of their age.
The information is available on the Internet or from local law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``On any other criminal offense, juveniles are protected,'' said
Tela Mange, spokeswoman with the Texas Department of Public Safety.
``This statute specifically says that juveniles are not protected
in sex crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Treating juveniles and adults the same caught some law
enforcement agencies, lawyers, parents and child advocacy groups by
surprise. Some called it a proactive approach that protects the
public; others called it overzealous.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the bill, state Rep. Ray Allen, said the
disclosure of registered juveniles is not intended as punishment
but is necessary to track offenders and protect the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that start sexual offenses as juveniles are at
extremely high risk to continue that behavior unless they receive
effective therapy,'' said Allen, R-Grand Prairie. ``Therapy has not
gotten a great record as far as success in changing that
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile sex offenders began registering with the state in 1991.
Sex offenses requiring registration range from aggravated sexual
assault to two convictions for indecent exposure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, legislators made public the names and ages of juvenile
sex offenders convicted after Aug. 31 of that year. The streets
where they live and general descriptions of their crimes were also
included.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the law expanded to include people still in the
judicial system who had been convicted after September 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the inclusion of photos and specific addresses, some
observers wonder whether the state has gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think bottom line, it's an overreaction to a legitimate
concern,'' said Bruce Beasley, a Fort Worth attorney who sometimes
defends juveniles. ``But until more and more people are caught up
in it _ good people _ and they realize what's happening, no one is
going to care.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Jordan, program administrator for the DPS Special Crimes
Division, said some agencies have needed convincing that releasing
juveniles' photographs is all right.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington was one of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big change to what we normally see in the law,''
Arlington police spokesman Dee Anderson said. ``That was obviously
a concern since juvenile arrest records are always sealed, and
there's not any ability for people to access those records,
sometimes even when people become adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Of 310 sex offenders registered with Arlington, Anderson said,
22 are juveniles. Under state law, anyone younger than 17 is
considered a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, 37 of 697 sex offenders listed with the city were
juveniles when they registered.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is a 14-year-old boy convicted of indecency with a
child in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother said her son was 9 at the time. He had been
abused at a younger age by a relative, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The youth was sent to a boys ranch for one year and is still in
therapy. He cannot be around any child younger than himself without
supervision, his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she knew about the new sex offender registration law
but never believed that it would affect her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought because he was a juvenile that they would keep it
under wraps,'' she said. ``My husband sort of expected it, but I
didn't think they'd be that cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman is considering home-schooling her son and said she
worries that he will have trouble getting a job later. But most of
all, she said, she fears for his safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid someone's going to find out and try to do something
to him,'' she said. ``They are not adults. Why treat them like
adults? He's done his time.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Burton, an attorney and founder of the Houston-based
advocacy group Justice For Children, said he favors the release of
photographs and specific addresses of sex offenders _ children or
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly conceivable that a person can be under the age
of 18 and be a very serious sex offender,'' Burton said. ``It would
concern me just as much that my children live in an area where a
juvenile sex offender lives than an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about adult sex offenders must be published in
newspapers, except for some cases involving incest, Jordan said.
But no information about juveniles will be printed in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said publishing juveniles' photos and names over the
Internet may stop them from becoming sexual predators as adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 42-year-old male that's been in the penitentiary twice,
there's not a whole lot that's going to change his mind,'' Jordan
said. ``But to that 14-year-old who commits a sexual offense, this
could be pretty impressionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Juveniles are required to register with their local agencies for
10 years after they complete their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that the laws protecting juvenile records
were written at a time when there probably weren't as many
dangerous, violent offenders,'' said Karen Lynn, a prosecutor
assigned to handle juvenile sex offender cases in Tarrant County,
where Fort Worth and Arlington are located. ``I think society
stepped back and has taken a new look at the type of crimes these
juveniles are committing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Diana Philip, regional director of the American Civil
Liberties Union, said posting sex offenders on the Internet,
especially juveniles, sends the message that they cannot be
rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go the extra length as to call attention to these
individuals so other people can ostracize them _ so they don't have
a chance to live a normal life again _ doesn't do anybody any
good,'' Philip said.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of the Arlington girl convicted of assaulting a
5-year-old said her daughter is innocent and will never be the
same, even if the family wins its appeal of her conviction. The
girl was put on two years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no going back. You can't take that back once you've
dished that out,'' the mother said. ``To the world, she's going to
always be guilty because it was on the computer, and that sticks
with people.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother said that when the sexual assault was alleged to have
taken place in Arlington, her daughter was in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The woman only recently told her daughter that her face is on
the Arlington Police Department's Web site for fear that she
wouldn't return to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to protect young kids,'' the mother said.
``They introduced my baby to a whole new world. To me, it feels
like they have raped and violated my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the conviction is overturned, a new picture will be taken
every year of the girl through 2011.

FOREST CAMP LEAVES 'EM IN DUST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ Forest Camp didn't merely run away from the
rest of the summer's best local 2-year-olds on Wednesday to give
trainer Bob Baffert a fourth consecutive victory in the Del Mar
Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   He also left Baffert's first three Futurity champions _ big
names Silver Charm, Souvenir Copy and Worldly Manner _ in the
historical dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to say one horse is better than the others,''
Baffert said. ``But he's probably the most impressive winner I've
had in the Futurity.''
</P>
<P>
   That's saying something, since Silver Charm went on to win the
1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness, and Worldly Manner went on to
make headlines when he was purchased for $5 million in '98 by
Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   With David Flores riding, Forest Camp, a son of Deputy Minister
owned by Aaron and Marie Jones of Oregon, won by 5{ lengths in a
record 1:21.67 for the 7-furlong stakes. Odds-on favorite Dixie
Union was second, his first defeat in four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Camp pulled so hard at the bit as he zipped from third to
first on the far turn that Flores said his saddle began to slip
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winner is hard to explain,'' said an awed Alex Solis,
Dixie Union's jockey.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Camp won his only previous race after a stumbling start.
Then he got better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been training unbelievably,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Few bettors on the 42nd and final day of the Del Mar season knew
just how good the colt's recent workouts had been. An impressive
workout was left off the official list published by the Daily
Racing Form.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar's team of clockers apparently were looking the other way
when Forest Camp went 6 furlongs in a fabulous 1:10 4/5 on Aug. 23.
Another publication, Today's Racing Digest, rated the effort
``very, very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Track executives should be embarrassed by the failure to provide
such persuasive information to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   About as embarrassed as Forest Camp's opponents are _ including
Baffert-trained Captain Steve (third) and Cameron Pass (fifth).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the first (2-year-old) I've had with the class to say,
`This is a Derby horse,' '' Aaron Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The win capped a huge summer for Baffert and Flores. Baffert
earned his third straight Del Mar training title with 27 victories,
including 10 stakes wins, tying his 1998 record. Flores captured
his first Del Mar riding title, beating Solis 38-32.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Kent Desormeaux came away from a fall Monday with a
wrist fracture and a thigh bruise severe enough to put him on
crutches. He'll miss at least some of the major races at the Oak
Tree meet that opens Sept. 29. . . . Laffit Pincay won No. 8,788
aboard Canyon Crest on Wednesday and is 45 from Bill Shoemaker's
career record. . . . Pacific Classic winner General Challenge was
named Horse of the Meet in a press-box poll. . . . The tally of
horse deaths in racing and training at Del Mar, closely watched
after last year's breakdown epidemic, was nine in the end, three
fewer than 1998.

HALF OF PHOENIX BALLOTS WERE MAILED IN, CAST EARLY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE MCCLOY AND CAROL SOWERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For the first time, more than half of Phoenix voters
in Tuesday's municipal elections cast their ballots without going
to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   It was a harbinger of things to come. Scottsdale City Clerk
Sonia Robertson predicted Wednesday that an all-mail election - as
Oregon has - could be held in that city as early as 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not impossible,'' she said. ``The technology is there to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward mail-in and early voting is changing election
campaign strategy, and voters are responding to different messages,
depending on when they vote.
</P>
<P>
   While Scottsdale voters rejected a canal-based development
project by 54 to 46 percent, those who cast their votes early or by
mail actually favored the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   And as low as the turnout was _ 27 percent in Scottsdale, 17
percent in Phoenix - election officials said participation might be
even less without early balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Early balloting was expanded in 1991 for the first time for the
runoff election that put Fife Symington in the Governor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Arizona voters who wanted an absentee ballot had to
be 65 or older, and had to file a witnessed statement that they
were ill or would be out of town on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Now, any voter can request an early ballot, and mail it to
election authorities or cast it at any polling place. Political
consultants will even fill out the request on a voter's behalf,
requiring only the voter's signature.
</P>
<P>
   More than 57 percent of Tuesday's Phoenix ballots were cast
early or by mail. It was 45 percent in the last city election, in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County Elections Director Karen Osborne said she
counted 30,000 early or mail ballots in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be 400,000 in the (2000) general election,'' she
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Around Arizona, Secretary of State Betsey Bayless said early and
mail ballots are approaching 50 percent of the votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   Early balloting was the key to campaigns for many issues in
Tuesday's city elections - from something as obscure as a natural
gas franchise in Phoenix to a project as high profile as the $653
million Canals of Scottsdale proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew vote-by-mail was going to be very significant,'' said
Bob Grossfeld, consultant for Black Mountain Gas Co. ``What could
have gone wrong was that it would be ignored completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Uninformed voters generally vote ``no.'' The early-voting
campaign helped pass the gas franchise by 80 to 20 percent,
Grossfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar campaign tactics gave the canals proposal 54 to 46
percent approval among early voters. Unfortunately, campaign
chairman Bill Heckman said, the opposition rallied those voters who
went to the polls after the early voters had mailed their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Heckman said he should have focused more on finding early voters
who supported the project and less on broad-based direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   His advice to promoters of Scottsdale's Los Arcos Mall
redevelopment proposal on the Nov. 2 city ballot: ``Get the message
out. Find your support base. Make it easier for them to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   While Scottsdale considers an all-mail election sometime soon,
several Valley cities, such as Fountain Hills and Carefree, already
have done balloting without polling places.
</P>
<P>
   In the Aguila Fire District, County Elections Director Osborne
credits all-mail balloting with a 50 percent turnout on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature would have to change election law to allow
all-mail balloting in statewide or congressional races, Osborne
said, adding that she expects no such move in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Bayless considered all-mail voting for Arizona's Feb. 22
Presidential Preference Primary, but lawmakers rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne and Bayless said the public appears divided on the
merits of all-mail balloting, which has become routine in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a segment of the public that loves to go to the polls
on Election Day,'' Bayless said. ``They believe it's their duty as
an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a number of people who have said that to me have now
requested a mail ballot, like my parents, for instance.'' &QL;

MEXICO WANTS MEETING WITH U.S. LABOR CHIEF ON APPLE WORKERS'
RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Mexican government agency, citing what it says is evidence of
widespread abuse of workers' rights in Washington's apple industry,
has asked for a meeting with U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman to
talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   The charges could lead not only to a meeting with Herman, but to
hearings in Washington state by a panel of U.S. and Mexican
government officials, an investigation by a special committee of
independent experts, and even possible sanctions on Washington
apple exports to Mexico, a U.S. Labor Department spokesman
confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued by Mexico's National Administrative Office cited
allegations of workers' rights abuses under the North American
Agreement on Labor Cooperation and the labor side agreement to the
North American Free Trade Agreement, said Bob Zachariasiewicz, the
Labor Department's spokesman for international labor affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with the report is a request from Mexico's Secretary of
Labor Mariano Palacios Alcocer for formal consultations with
Secretary Herman,'' Zachariasiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in Spanish and is being translated. It is currently
under consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   The request for consultation is an early step in a process set
up under the two international labor agreements, said Lance Compa
at the International Labor Rights Fund, based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican National Administrative Office report charges that
there is a lack of legal protection for farmworker union organizing
and alleges management threats and intimidation against workers'
organizing efforts in Washington orchards and in packing and
shipping operations, Compa said.
</P>
<P>
   Compa said the report charges discrimination against migrant
workers in housing, health care, workers' compensation and in other
programs. The report claims budget cuts in U.S. enforcement
agencies such as the National Labor Relations Board and
Occupational Safety and Health Administration have resulted in
letting the problems go unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gempler of the Washington Apple Growers League in Yakima
said he had been waiting for a response from Mexico's National
Administrative Office to the labor rights complaint, but that he
had not seen its report citing evidence of abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This process is new to us and it is not understood by many,''
Gempler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our contention all along is that the United States has
substantial labor laws protecting workers and that the federal and
the more stringent state laws are enforced here. I would be
surprised if there is a finding that there was inadequate labor
protection to Washington farm workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of health and safety violations ``don't hold up,''
Gempler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industrial insurance rates and accidents have been going down
and we feel that is evidence of improvement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He called the Mexican report ``an unusual, high-profile tactic''
tied to a union vote next week at one of two apple packing plants
involved in Teamster union organizing efforts. Labor law violation
complaints remain before the National Labor Relations Board at the
other plant.
</P>
<P>
   Compa, a professor at Cornell University's School of Industrial
and Labor Relations who is advising the labor rights fund, said the
complaint against the state's apple industry was filed in May 1998
on behalf of some of the 60,000 Mexican and Mexican-American
farmworkers and human rights groups in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also accompanied a group of apple industry workers to Mexico
who provided information to the Mexican government in connection
with the complaint,'' Compa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody hopes this doesn't get to the point of hearings or
sanctions. We certainly hope some resolution is achieved respecting
workers' rights. I think showing some commitment to progress would
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor rights fund was one of three organizations, along with
the Teamsters union and United Farm Workers of America, that backed
the complaint, accusing the Washington apple industry of routinely
violating rights of Mexican and Mexican American apple pickers and
packers and threatening their health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-page complaint was initiated as the Teamsters attempted
to organize apple workers in Wenatchee and Yakima packing plants
and as the United Farm Workers attempted to organize orchard
workers. Part of the complaint centers on alleged efforts by
growers to discourage workers from joining the unions.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican National Administrative Office has been
investigating allegations in the complaint since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Release of its report was delayed until now by personnel changes
in Mexico's department of labor, said Pharis Harvey, director of
the International Labor Rights Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico had been one of the largest markets for Washington apple
exports until a 100 percent tariff was imposed after Mexican
growers charged that Washington growers were ``dumping'' apples
there at low prices.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Gary Locke led a trade delegation to Mexico last
month seeking to boost apple exports to Mexico and encourage
Mexican government officials to drop the tariff.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Lemus Gas, Mexico's consul in Seattle, said he is
attempting to obtain additional information about his government's
report and the next steps in the process under the international
labor agreements.

YANKEES COME FROM BEHIND TO BEAT ROYALS, 9-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Joe Torre stood in the middle of the
visitors' clubhouse here before Wednesday night's game and opened
the floor to this question: Why have the Yankees played to the
level of their opponents?
</P>
<P>
   Torre had tried cajoling his players earlier in the year,
without impact, so he tried a different approach. Speaking one at a
time, a few players said they felt the Yankees had played hard all
year. Tino Martinez, the first baseman, mentioned that he was
surprised to pick up a newspaper on Wednesday and see Boston only
five and one-half games out of first place. The bench coach, Don
Zimmer, tried lending some perspective, noting that the Yankees
were in first place, 30 games over .500, and said there was no
reason to put unnecessary pressure on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They all agreed that Wednesday night's game with the Royals was
important _ and they played with great purpose, coming back from an
early 3-0 deficit with the patient approach that has sometimes
abandoned them as the Yankees whipped Kansas City, 9-5. Derek Jeter
went 2 for 4 with two walks and Darryl Strawberry had a single, a
double and two walks in support of Orlando Hernandez, whose record
improved to 16-7. Coupled with Boston's loss to Oakland, the
Yankees lead the American League East by six and one-half games.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's contest had consequence in the standing and
for the Yankees' state of mind. They had lost two straight games,
including a poor performance in a 6-3 decision Tuesday night, and
they will face Pedro Martinez on Friday in the first of a
three-game series against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. ``You'd
certainly like to go into that game winning one in a row,'' Torre
said, ``as opposed to losing three in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Royals who seized the lead on Wednesday night,
scoring three runs on three hits against Hernandez in the first.
Then Strawberry, Jorge Posada and Shane Spencer all drew walks at
the outset of the second, and all three scored when Luis Sojo, who
replaced Chuck Knoblauch at second base for the day, lined a
three-run double.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' aggressiveness helped them break open the game in
the fifth. Ricky Ledee walked leading off, and when the count
reached full, he broke from first. Royals second baseman Mendy
Lopez moved to cover the bag, and Jeter singled into the defensive
vacuum. Both eventually scored. Later, with Martinez at second and
Strawberry at first, both runners broke on a 3-2 pitch to Posada,
and the catcher also singled through the hole where Lopez had been
positioned.
</P>
<P>
   With four runs, the Yankees effectively finished Kansas City for
the evening, and probably improved the mood of their perplexed
principal owner, George Steinbrenner. The Yankees have done well in
what be called adrenaline games: 4-2 against Cleveland, 6-4 against
Oakland, 8-4 against Texas, 8-1 against Toronto. But they are 4-5
against Kansas City, 4-5 against Chicago, 4-6 against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview on Wednesday morning, Steinbrenner said:
``Last year, we beat up on the little guys, and that's what you
have to do to have a great record. We haven't been able to beat up
on the little guys.''

NONAGENARIAN PLANS 99TH BIRTHDAY BASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Nine is an extraordinary number, and Dan
Kienle is a remarkable man.
</P>
<P>
   Kienle celebrates his 99th birthday today _ on 9-9-99.
</P>
<P>
   While many marvel at this confluence in numerology, the retired
machinist focuses on more earthly matters, like the candlelight
dinner planned with his friends at the Burbank Gardens Retirement
Hotel, where he lives northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing in the world is to laugh,'' said Kienle, who
will be the star of the occasion, dishing out cake and humor.
``We're all friends together. We understand each other. So you
can't ask for more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   All those 9s in a row add up to a very happy day for everyone,
said a West Los Angeles psychic named Merho who has been divining
the meaning of numbers for nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's extraordinary. It will be a great day of happiness,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kienle credits his longevity to daily doses of vitamins and
spices, as well as humor. Both were in evidence during Wednesday's
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Moving down hallways toward the dining room with the assistance
of a walker, Kienle stopped to chat with 81-year-old Ethel Somers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello darling. I am looking forward to (the party),'' she
said. ``It's exciting. I never really wanted to live that long, but
I'm happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   After thanking her, Kienle explained why he likes to talk and
spend time with the women who live and work in the home. ``Women
rule the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving to his customary table for lunch, Kienle showed one of
his daily concoctions of spices and vitamins. Into his bowl of
tomato soup Kienle sprinkled brewer's yeast, kelp, lecithin,
cayenne pepper and garlic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh boy, that tastes good. Every spoonful is like honey,'' he
remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken fajitas and rice followed and Kienle was clearly
energized. Then ``Dan, Dan the vitamin man'' was back in the
hallways for a walk and some socializing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's a crackup,'' said Christine Cote, a receptionist
who gets daily packages of vitamins and cookies from Kienle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever ails you, he has the cure,'' she said. ``Look at him.
It's all those vitamins.''
</P>
<P>
   Defined by the number nine since birth also has contributed to
Kienle's fortune, Merho said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number nine is a number that is universal and free,'' said
Merho, who does regular psychic readings at the Wild Oats health
food store at Wilshire Boulevard and Fifth Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universal is someone who embraces all of humanity and is not
provincial, someone who can see at a long range. Free means open
minded,'' she explained. ``So he is someone who is a natural
teacher. He has a perspective that works.''
</P>
<P>
   The many careers Kienle took on reflected his philosophy of
life. ``Grab it by the horns. Don't be idle. Time goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   He played guitar in orchestras through the Great Depression and
then earned a living as a machinist and also as an electronic
technician, including a stint with Thomas Edison's labs.
</P>
<P>
   Newark, N.J., was home for his first 60 years. Then Kienle moved
with his wife to Glendale to be near their son, Don. Kienle
returned to work as a machinist, spending a dozen years
manufacturing aerospace parts.
</P>
<P>
   Kienle moved with his wife into the board and care home in 1988.
He has been a widower since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite a loss to him. But my father tends to have a
positive outlook on life,'' said Don Kienle, a retired electronic
engineer who lives in Playa del Rey.
</P>
<P>
   As Kienle heads toward his 100th birthday in 2000, he also
exemplifies the perfection Merho said is characteristic of the
number nine. Kienle was born in 1900 and his doctor has said he has
every expectation of reaching his own century mark and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally completing the circle,'' Merho said.
</P>
<P>
   While others marvel at Kienle's milestone, he downplays the
significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about it. I just go on and on.''

FORMER BRUINS SUCCEED ON BEACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ When Annett Buckner Davis left St. Anthony
High in Long Beach as the Saints most accomplished volleyball
player, it was no surprise that she would continue to play at a
high caliber for UCLA. And she did.
</P>
<P>
   But none would have expected her volleyball aspirations to
include such lofty goals on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   She and former Bruin teammate Jenny Johnson Jordan have taken
the beach volleyball scene by storm over the last 1{ years, and now
have a shot at making the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. They
are ranked No. 2 on the FIVB Beach Volleyball Tour heading into the
U.S. Olympic Cup this weekend at Crown Point Shores in San Diego's
Mission Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Their rise to the top in the nation has been short and sweet.
They have made major strides this year, winning their first major
event at the FIVB Portugese Open and also finishing runner-up to
the longtime top-ranked Brazilian team of Adriana Behar and Shelda
Bede at the World Championships in Marseille, France, in July. They
are also entered in the San Diego tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from the bottom of the barrel to one of the top
teams,'' said Buckner Davis, who now lives in the Tarzana section
of Los Angeles with her husband, former Bruin swimmer Byron Davis.
``Everything happened really fast this year. We had a great year. A
lot of people are probably surprised. I don't think anybody thought
we had a chance of making the Olympics and now we do.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Volleyball will choose two women's teams with the best eight
finishes from January 1999 to Aug. 15, 2000 to represent the United
States in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Buckner Davis and Johnson Jordan, the daughter of Olympian Rafer
Johnson, have competed in six FIVB tournaments and have earned
$116,000 this year. They hold a 46-10 match record.
</P>
<P>
   This tournament did not exist when they were trying to get their
feet in the door. It primarily serves lower teams to gain points to
enter the world tour, but it also features some of the top
competition internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does help and I wish it was around when we were struggling
to get in,'' Buckner Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Buckner Davis and Johnson Jordan, who also lives in Tarzana,
will open the eight-team competition in their first meeting against
Debora Schoon Kadijk and Rebekka Kadika of the Netherlands at 11
a.m. Friday. The last match is scheduled at 4 p.m. Competition
resumes Saturday, beginning at 11 a.m. On Sunday, the bronze medal
match begins at 11 a.m. and the championship is at 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The pair of UCLA All-Americans will conclude the season in the
FIVB World Tour closer at the Brazil Open in November.

HULL TO PUSH GUEST WORKER PROGRAM FOR BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACIELLA SEVILLA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull is hoping to enlist the support of her
Southwestern border counterparts for a new guest worker program
aimed at satisfying the demand for low-skilled labor in Arizona and
helping to combat illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Hull wants to revise and expand the 1940s bracero, or ``helping
arms,'' program, allowing foreign job seekers to apply for
temporary work permits to fill jobs in industries where there's a
shortage of workers, such as agriculture, hotels and restaurants,
construction and custodial services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her proposal is to try to match people who need jobs with jobs
that are going wanting,'' said Francie Noyes, Hull's press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Hull begins her lobbying tonight at a private dinner opening the
annual Border Governors Conference in Tijuana, which will draw the
governors of the six Mexican states along the U.S. border with the
governors of Arizona, California and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the only border governor not
attending the conference, is sending a representative.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the governors and their delegations will spend the
morning in round-table discussions of issues relating to border
crossings, economic development, the environment and health in the
border region.
</P>
<P>
   Topping Hull's agenda of items for discussion will be the guest
worker proposal, which she has been pushing publicly since the
spring, Margie Emmermann, the governor's Mexico policy adviser,
told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't help but have that as an issue right now,'' Emmermann
said, noting the tight Arizona labor market and the huge rise in
illegal immigration across the Sonoran border.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Hull toured Douglas, the nation's busiest illegal border
entry point, and told concerned citizens there that Arizona could
be the ideal test site for a guest worker program.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the federal government offers a limited number of
work visas annually to foreign workers. But employers complain that
the paperwork is cumbersome, costly and time-consuming, making it
of little practical use for filling low-wage, seasonal jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Hull wants to see a revised bracero program, which allowed
thousands of Mexican laborers to enter the country legally on
temporary work permits to fill jobs primarily in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican federal government officials have publicly endorsed the
idea in meetings with U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Hull's proposal has found staunch supporters among
Douglas Mayor Ray Borane and Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz. But it is
unclear where the other U.S. border governors stand.
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, and New Mexico Gov. Gary
Johnson, a Republican, haven't made their positions public.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a Republican, said last week that he wants to ``revisit''
the idea of a guest worker program to ensure there are enough
workers to meet the nation's needs, but he has not endorsed a
specific proposal, spokesman Scott McClellan told the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Hull acknowledged last month that there has been strong
opposition outside the Southwestern border states for reviving a
bracero program. Organized labor leaders argue that such an influx
of foreign workers could drive down U.S. wages and increase illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Given the controversy surrounding any discussion of immigration
and temporary workers, if Hull succeeds in gaining support from the
border governors for a guest worker program it would be a major
political boost for her proposal, said Mark Kirkorian, executive
director of the Center for Immigration Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be politically significant if the governors of the
four border states issued a joint statement,'' Kirkorian told AP.
``It would definitely be a big deal.''  &QL;

MEXICO WANTS MEETING WITH U.S. LABOR CHIEF ON APPLE WORKERS'
RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Mexican government agency, citing what it says is evidence of
widespread abuse of workers' rights in Washington's apple industry,
has asked for a meeting with U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman to
talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   The charges could lead not only to a meeting with Herman, but to
hearings in Washington state by a panel of U.S. and Mexican
government officials, an investigation by a special committee of
independent experts, and even possible sanctions on Washington
apple exports to Mexico, a U.S. Labor Department spokesman
confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued by Mexico's National Administrative Office cited
allegations of workers' rights abuses under the North American
Agreement on Labor Cooperation and the labor side agreement to the
North American Free Trade Agreement, said Bob Zachariasiewicz, the
Labor Department's spokesman for international labor affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with the report is a request from Mexico's Secretary of
Labor Mariano Palacios Alcocer for formal consultations with
Secretary Herman,'' Zachariasiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in Spanish and is being translated. It is currently
under consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   The request for consultation is an early step in a process set
up under the two international labor agreements, said Lance Compa
at the International Labor Rights Fund, based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican National Administrative Office report charges that
there is a lack of legal protection for farmworker union organizing
and alleges management threats and intimidation against workers'
organizing efforts in Washington orchards and in packing and
shipping operations, Compa said.
</P>
<P>
   Compa said the report charges discrimination against migrant
workers in housing, health care, workers' compensation and in other
programs. The report claims budget cuts in U.S. enforcement
agencies such as the National Labor Relations Board and
Occupational Safety and Health Administration have resulted in
letting the problems go unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gempler of the Washington Apple Growers League in Yakima
said he had been waiting for a response from Mexico's National
Administrative Office to the labor rights complaint, but that he
had not seen its report citing evidence of abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This process is new to us and it is not understood by many,''
Gempler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our contention all along is that the United States has
substantial labor laws protecting workers and that the federal and
the more stringent state laws are enforced here. I would be
surprised if there is a finding that there was inadequate labor
protection to Washington farm workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of health and safety violations ``don't hold up,''
Gempler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industrial insurance rates and accidents have been going down
and we feel that is evidence of improvement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He called the Mexican report ``an unusual, high-profile tactic''
tied to a union vote next week at one of two apple packing plants
involved in Teamster union organizing efforts. Labor law violation
complaints remain before the National Labor Relations Board at the
other plant.
</P>
<P>
   Compa, a professor at Cornell University's School of Industrial
and Labor Relations who is advising the labor rights fund, said the
complaint against the state's apple industry was filed in May 1998
on behalf of some of the 60,000 Mexican and Mexican-American
farmworkers and human rights groups in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also accompanied a group of apple industry workers to Mexico
who provided information to the Mexican government in connection
with the complaint,'' Compa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody hopes this doesn't get to the point of hearings or
sanctions. We certainly hope some resolution is achieved respecting
workers' rights. I think showing some commitment to progress would
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor rights fund was one of three organizations, along with
the Teamsters union and United Farm Workers of America, that backed
the complaint, accusing the Washington apple industry of routinely
violating rights of Mexican and Mexican American apple pickers and
packers and threatening their health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-page complaint was initiated as the Teamsters attempted
to organize apple workers in Wenatchee and Yakima packing plants
and as the United Farm Workers attempted to organize orchard
workers. Part of the complaint centers on alleged efforts by
growers to discourage workers from joining the unions.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican National Administrative Office has been
investigating allegations in the complaint since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Release of its report was delayed until now by personnel changes
in Mexico's department of labor, said Pharis Harvey, director of
the International Labor Rights Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico had been one of the largest markets for Washington apple
exports until a 100 percent tariff was imposed after Mexican
growers charged that Washington growers were ``dumping'' apples
there at low prices.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Gary Locke led a trade delegation to Mexico last
month seeking to boost apple exports to Mexico and encourage
Mexican government officials to drop the tariff.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Lemus Gas, Mexico's consul in Seattle, said he is
attempting to obtain additional information about his government's
report and the next steps in the process under the international
labor agreements.

MUSEUM VISITORS TO GET CLEAR VIEW OF LIBERTY BELL 7 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUTCHINSON, Kan. _ Beginning at 9 a.m. on Sept. 9, visitors to
the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center can press their noses
against the glass windows and watch a bit of history unfold.
</P>
<P>
   For the next six months, technicians will disassemble, clean and
reassemble Liberty Bell 7, the Mercury space capsule that rested in
the depths of the Atlantic Ocean for 38 years before being
recovered July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Space buffs will be able to watch specialists at their work
tables as they restore astronaut Gus Grissom's corroded capsule,
which sunk after a suborbital flight in July 1961 about 300 miles
off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Today the spacecraft sits in a large plastic box with a green
garden hose continuously spraying fresh water over it in an effort
to protect the fragile contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This still seems a little hard to believe that this event is
even happening, simply because it's still hard to believe this
spacecraft sits here in Hutchinson,'' said Max Ary, the
Cosmosphere's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery project was financed by the Discovery Channel,
which plans to broadcast a two-hour special, ``In Search of Liberty
Bell 7,'' on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Ary negotiated to bring the Mercury capsule to the Cosmosphere.
He said it will cost the space center about $250,000 for bringing
the capsule to Hutchinson and for restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Once the restoration is complete, the Discovery Channel will
take Liberty Bell 7 on a three-year tour, beginning about the
middle of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft eventually will be returned to Hutchinson, where
it will be permanently displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly four decades that Grissom's capsule spent more than
three miles beneath the ocean's surface left plenty of work for the
Cosmosphere experts.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Buckingham, a restoration specialist, already has been busy
on a few of the pieces removed from the interior of the craft.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom's survival knife, a prized astronaut possession, was
recovered from under the spacecraft's couch and cleaned. It was on
display Wednesday as space center officials provided a sneak
preview for reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five Mercury-head dimes, believed to have been stashed in
the capsule by unknown souvenir hunters, also have been recovered
and were on display.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham and the others won't be using a lot of sophisticated
tools to remove corrosion from the estimated 25,000 space capsule
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Things like brass-bristled brushes, single-edged razor blades
and a few dental picks make up the technicians' tool kits.
</P>

he works doesn't bother him at all.

   Visitors were able to watch him work on the restoration of the

it takes to get an artifact back to museum quality,'' Buckingham
said.

BUSH ATTENDS FUND-RAISER IN KANSAS CITY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush jetted into Kansas
City Wednesday and collected another $250,000 for his already
lavishly funded campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   If other candidates have a problem with that, he said, they're
not being honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one candidate running for president wouldn't want to trade
places with me,'' the GOP front-runner said before attending a
fund-raiser at the Mission Hills, Kan., home of Donald J. and Adele
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   How about John McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona whose
presidential bid rests on his arguments to reform campaign-finance
laws?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'd like to have $40 million,'' Bush said as he
marched up the steps of the Hall mansion, where 250 supporters
waited.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign is believed to have raised perhaps more than $50
million. Bush says he's not certain of the latest tally _ it's not
that he flips through the receipts every day _ but ``I view it as a
tremendous asset.''
</P>
<P>
   During his four-hour stay in the Kansas City area, capping a day
in which he zipped through four states, Bush reiterated his
feelings of being ``humbled'' by an unprecedented amount of
campaign donations so early in the presidential race. The number of
individual donors now exceeds 105,000, said Bush deputy
communications manager Andrew Malcolm, and the average gift is
about $400.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also discussed with The Kansas City Star matters ranging
from his service in the Texas Air National Guard to his support for
teaching creationism along with evolution in public schools, if
that's what school districts want.
</P>
<P>
   Greeting Bush at Downtown Airport was Kansas Gov. Bill Graves, a
Bush supporter who recently criticized his own state's Board of
Education for adopting a policy that allows schools to incorporate
creationism in their curricula, or to eliminate evolution lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a state issue,'' said Bush. ``The people of Texas can
resolve that issue as can the people of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an interesting part of knowledge (to have) a
theory of evolution and a theory of creationism. People should be
exposed to different points of view. Should the people choose in my
state (to adopt a rule similar to Kansas') I have no problem'' with
public schools teaching both creationism and evolution.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I personally believe God created the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas dignitaries welcoming Bush included a dozen state
lawmakers who have endorsed the 53-year-old Texan. Bush also made
stops Wednesday in New Hampshire and Rhode Island. He flew back to
his home in Austin after the Mission Hills fund-raiser Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The private benefit at the Halls' drew some of the most
influential residents of the area. Donald Hall is chairman of
Hallmark Cards and Adele Hall is active in philanthropic
organizations. Media were not invited, but the candidate spent
several minutes in a van answering a Star reporter's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he's not taking his strong lead in the Republican
polls for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a great guy whose approval ratings were somewhere
around the 90s (in percent) in 1991,'' he said, referring to his
father's term in the White House. ``And they went down to 38
percent in 1992. I know what happens in the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions about whether he received preferential
treatment to secure a spot in the National Guard at the height of
the Vietnam War, Bush said: ``Did I ever make a call on my own
behalf? The answer is no. Did my dad call on my behalf? The answer
is no....They were looking for pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no undue influence'' as far as he knew, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, The Dallas Morning News published a story
alleging that Ben Barnes, a Democrat and former Texas lieutenant
governor, told two friends that Houston oilman Sidney A. Adger
asked him to help Bush gain a slot in the Guard. Adger, a Bush
family friend, died in 1996. Barnes has denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters at Downtown Airport that ``sometimes when
you're a front-runner, people want to take shots....I won't run a
negative campaign, but if I'm attacked, of course, I'll respond....
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working hard to be the next president of the United
States,'' he said. ``And I think I'm going to win.''

THE VOTERS THAT ROARED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - As conventional wisdom would have it, big money always
wins campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Arizona to buck the trend. In four months, two
Phoenix area grassroots groups that scraped together war chests
with collection jars, phone trees and personal checks triumphed
over wealthy, impeccably organized developers who wanted public
backing to help construct a legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with two similar votes set for Nov. 2, developers of a
proposed Phoenix Coyotes hockey complex in Scottsdale and
convention compound in Tucson may have to tone down slick campaigns
and rethink how to persuade voters to let them keep a share of
sales tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And Senate President Brenda Burns, R-Glendale, who led a
successful fight last spring to repeal two developer-friendly tax
incentive laws Scottsdale and Mesa tried to use, says she feels
vindicated. ``I really think what the voters are saying is they
want to be choosy,'' she said, adding that ``by and large'' voters
want public money to be used very carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Other emotional debates over public subsidies have erupted in
the past half-decade. After Phoenix voters had defeated a proposed
ballpark, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in 1994 approved
a quarter-cent sales tax to finance $238 million of the $350
million cost of the Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The vote led to perhaps the most infamous local act of rage over
public financing: Former Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose
Wilcox was wounded in August 1997 by a gun-wielding homeless man
angry over her support the tax. &QL; 
GOLIATHS KNOCKED DOWN &QL; 
In Scottsdale, a group of merchants who stood to lose their shops
took on a California real estate company with consultants and
plenty of experience securing public dollars for entertainment and
retail complexes. And they won. Voters Tuesday snuffed a proposed
$653 million museum-entertainment complex downtown &UR; by 54 percent to
46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters saw through the arrogance,'' said Mike Dollin, an urban
designer and Scottsdale resident who opposed the Canals of
Scottsdale project.
</P>
<P>
   In Mesa, a tiny faction of residents took on the purse-power of
professional sports last May. Then voters &UR; balked at providing
public dollars to private enterprise, defeating a proposed $1.8
million Arizona Cardinals football stadium and convention complex
by a 3-2 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people are tired of footing the bill for
private enterprise,'' said Manny Cortez, a small-business man who
led a shoestring effort to block the Rio Salado Crossing. He said
his group was outspent 70-1.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four months in Scottsdale, another version of David
and Goliath played out. Backers launched a $838,000 media blitz:
They opened a headquarters in the Galleria across from Scottsdale
Fashion Square, produced television spots and rented computers and
phones, and hired campaign staff. The campaign's ``volunteer''
chairman was paid $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   They called theirs the only plan to breathe life into downtown
and revive the empty Scottsdale Galleria, which failed as a
shopping mall in 1993. They promised to bring boat rides, museums,
ritzy shops and Broadway-style theaters - all if voters would let
them use almost 200 million public dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, foes held picnics, sent chain e-mails and collected
donations in jars in storefronts. They raised about $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, they prevailed with a simple message: Scottsdale
shouldn't pour millions into a project that would level two city
blocks in Scottsdale's Fifth Avenue shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying enough already,'' said Lois Fitch, a retired
teacher and Save Old Scottsdale's coordinator of volunteers. ``If
they want to build, then they can finance it themselves. Don't let
us be responsible for paying your way.'' &QL; 
CITY'S CHARACTER THREATENED &QL; 
Scottsdale Mayor Sam Campana, one of the Canals project's chief
backers, thinks the defeat was less about the financing and more
about saving three dozen shops on Fifth Avenue. ``I really think
that the people believe that the character of downtown Scottsdale
was at risk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents who voted against the project disagreed. ``I just
feel like the money could be better utilized, and I'm fundamentally
against bailing out the Galleria with tax money of any kind,'' said
Mike Langley, a commercial pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to kill the Los Arcos plan for the Phoenix
Coyotes are gathering heart from Tuesday's vote. ``I do believe
that folks really have had their eyes opened now,'' said Alan
Kaufman, who is leading the anti-arena effort.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Kaufman, vice president of Los Arcos owners, The Ellman
Cos. and no relation to Alan Kaufman, said voters are making
choices based on the projects, and not the subsidies. ``Our
strategy is to stay the course,'' he said. &QL; 
NOT REALLY ABOUT TAXES &QL; 
Steve Betts, a Phoenix land-use attorney who helped write both the
stadium district and theme-park laws that developers of the Canals,
Los Arcos and Rio Salado tried to use, cautioned against concluding
that the elections compare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rio Salado Crossing was too large for one community to
handle, and in Scottsdale, the debate was about what downtown
should look like. I don't believe that in either case it had to do
with the tax-recapture element,'' Betts said.
</P>
<P>
   All three projects would have allowed the developers to keep a
portion of the sales taxes collected in the developments to pay for
roads, parking and other public parts of their projects.
</P>
<P>
   The chief legislative supporter of tax-increment financing,
House Speaker Jeff Groscost, said the Scottsdale vote had nothing
to do with using public money. Groscost, R-Mesa, was the most
prominent supporter of the doomed Rio Salado Crossing in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite specifically, what people didn't like was you had some
hard-working business people who were about to lose their
businesses who were not being assured of a place in the final
development,'' he said. &QL;

MISSOURI GOVERNOR, ANTI-ABORTION LOBBYIST FACE OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ It was supposed to be a showdown Wednesday
over abortion: Gov. Mel Carnahan, an abortion rights backer, vs.
Lou DeFeo, veteran lobbyist for the Missouri Catholic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan vetoed an anti-abortion measure that DeFeo helped
draft. In a highly unusual move, the governor agreed to meet with
the key abortion foe, one week before Missouri lawmakers consider
whether to override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   The tense, nearly two-hour session before several dozen state
officials, aides and reporters highlighted differences on the bill.
But like most abortion debates it also triggered angry words, ugly
exchanges and few if any changed opinions.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Carnahan sternly dismissed DeFeo's objections to
the meeting's format and bristled when DeFeo chided him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something personal between you and me,'' Carnahan
said.
</P>
<P>
   In another case the governor curtly refused to answer the
lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. DeFeo, I am not here for questioning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo, who helped draft the bill, pointedly suggested that
Carnahan, an attorney himself, should have been more involved in
the discussion instead of deferring to his legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really unfortunate the governor cannot speak for
himself,'' DeFeo said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sifford, Carnahan's chief of staff, said afterward that
Joe Bednar did much of the talking because, as the governor's legal
counsel, Bednar is an expert on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows more about the bill than anybody else,'' Sifford
said. He said the governor did not engage DeFeo in a lengthy
dialogue because ``Lou DeFeo does not equal the governor. He is a
lobbyist.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo said during the meeting that he was ``outraged'' Carnahan
would accuse the Catholic Church of backing a bill that the
governor and other critics said could give legal protection to
violent acts.
</P>
<P>
   Even the post-session comments were biting. DeFeo branded much
of the comments by the governor's side ``nothing more than spin
doctoring, scare tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's chief of staff told reporters DeFeo ``has an
overinflated view of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place in a ``neutral'' site _ an office in the
Truman State Office Building across from the capitol. Carnahan and
Bednar sat at one table across from DeFeo and the two legislative
sponsors of the bill, Sen. Ted House of St. Charles and Rep. Bill
Luetkenhaus of Josephville.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters contend the bill would criminalize a late-term
abortion procedure that critics call ``partial birth'' abortions by
labeling them as infanticide. They insist that it only bans the
killing of an infant who is already born or partially born, meaning
the head or lower half of the body was outside the mother. The only
exception would be to save the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is really about drawing a line between abortion and
infanticide,'' DeFeo said.
</P>
<P>
   Bednar charged that the bill would actually ban abortions as
early as 5 weeks and provide a legal defense to those who use
lethal action to prevent the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   He said the measure was flawed by its failure to allow
exceptions to protect the mother's health and was designed to
overturn the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unconstitutional bill,'' he said. ``It's a dangerous
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said he opposes ``partial birth'' abortions and would
sign a bill that bans them if safeguards are included, including a
health exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bad policy for the state of Missouri,'' the governor
said of the vetoed bill. ``I think we have done this the wrong way.
We ought to go back to square one.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation won Senate approval 27-6 and passed the House
127-29. Backers have to muster two-thirds majorities in both
chambers _ 23 and 109 respectively _ to override the veto. Only six
vetoes have been overridden in state history.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo said it was significant that two former Missouri Supreme
Court judges, John Bardgett and Chip Robertson, provided letters
that sided with arguments used by him and other backers of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bardgett's letter said his review of the bill led him to
conclude that it only banned the one procedure cited by supporters
of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would not provide a new legal defense to those who
commit violence against abortion doctors. Bardgett said the
legislation ``is remarkably simple, candid and straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo suggested those letters carried more weight than the
conclusions of the governor's legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyers may differ and that's why we have judges,'' DeFeo
said. ``And now we have heard from the judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Bednar said DeFeo has been quoted in news accounts as saying
that one provision in the bill would permit abortion foes to take
violent steps to prevent the procedure banned by the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the first state to allow violence against
abortion doctors,'' Carnahan said later.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo disputed Bednar's accounts of quotes attributed to him,
and countered that the bill would not allow violence. House said
the provision in dispute was added at the request of abortion
rights lawmakers to ensure that abortion doctors were not unfairly
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo said Carnahan's case was based on his view that birth can
occur inside the mother's body and that, because of that unique
view, the bill would impose new curbs on early-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the word ``birth'' in the bill comes from medical
dictionaries that make it clear that the child must be partly or
totally outside the mother, DeFeo said.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo told reporters that there is new information that
indicates the procedure is being performed in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Gubernatorial aides said that DeFeo's source _ a letter to a
medical journal written by a Washington University medical student
_ did not constitute the kind of new discovery DeFeo suggested and
that state health officials had no such evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Dempsey, state health director, said in a brief
appearance that the bill could interfere with delicate decisions
between doctors and families involving premature infants. DeFeo
denied that.

AGASSI ADVANCES TO SEMIFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ball ticked the net and plopped onto Andre
Agassi's side of the court like a cracked egg into a frying pan.
Instead of giving up on the point, Agassi sprinted from the
baseline and turned his racket into a spatula.
</P>
<P>
   On the run, he flipped the ball back over the net and had the
snap reflex to field a sharp volley by a hard-charging Nicolas
Escude and put it away for a winner. At that moment, deep in a
first set tie breaker, Agassi seemed to nip the spirit of Escude.
</P>
<P>
   From there, a relentless Agassi reconfirmed his status as the
player to beat at the U.S. Open with a 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, 6-4 victory
over Escude on Wednesday night to advance to the semifinals against
third-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov, the 1999 Australian Open champion, had to feel the
sting of a record 48 aces from 12th-seeded Richard Krajicek, one of
the three men Kafelnikov had deemed capable of winning this Open.
But Kafelnikov used his passing shot to keep Krajicek, the 1996
Wimbledon winner, from making a complete recovery from a
two-sets-to-none deficit and, with a magnificent parting shot, sent
Krajicek home a loser by slamming an ace of his own, his 10th of
the match, to seal a 7-6 (7-0), 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5)
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov was far from sad about the way his match ended.
``This is one of the best matches I played in my career,'' said
Kafelnikov, who won his first Grand Slam title at the 1996 French
Open and spent six weeks this year at No.1, a position he can
regain by winning the Open.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian had sprinted ahead, 6-2, in the final tie breaker
only to watch the Dutchman creep back into contention. A flawed
forehand on his first match point made it 6-3, Krajicek's 47th ace
made it 6-4, and Kafelnikov put his hands over his eyes in
disbelief when Krajicek spoiled his third match point with a 48th
ace.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek's aces broke the record held by Goran Ivanisevic, who
fired 46 in losing to Magnus Norman at Wimbledon two years ago.

BRADLEY KICKS OFF PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN FROM CRYSTAL CITY, MO. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ Democrat Bill Bradley, launching his
presidential bid, stood in his small Mississippi River hometown
Wednesday and pledged to tackle some of America's big problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do fewer things, but they will be essential things,
and we will do them more thoroughly,'' Bradley said. ``I'll use the
growth of the new economy and do some of the big things that need
to be done in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, Bradley said, he would propose a limited agenda to
reduce childhood poverty, enact stiffer gun laws, make sure more
Americans have health insurance and reform a campaign system
dominated by wealthy special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to friends, teachers, neighbors and supporters who
spilled across the front yard of Crystal City High School, Bradley
emphasized that as president he would help more people benefit from
the soaring economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In so many ways, we have failed to use our prosperity to
improve the well-being of all our citizens,'' he said in a steady,
unrushed cadence. ``I feel an urgency to seize this moment in
history, to strengthen the weak and to challenge the strong to lead
us into our full greatness as a nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of the need for a ``deeper prosperity'' that reaches
out to people who have been left behind and helps the nation ``feel
rich inside as well as out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the American dream is not just for the lucky among us.
It is not just an ideal to wish on. It should be a possibility
available to all.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's kick-off speech was about laying out goals, not
specifying how they would be accomplished. The candidate has
promised more details this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The former three-term New Jersey senator is running against Vice
President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination. Although Gore is
favored, Bradley has shown surprising strength.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal City embraced Bradley with the warmth of an apple pie
served straight from the oven. The town, so named because of a
now-closed plate-glass factory, was decorated with American flags
and signs urging Bradley to ``give 'em hell'' and offering
encouragement. ``It can happen!'' one placard read.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Bradley gestured toward the river at an empty,
weeded lot where the old Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. plant once
stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't grow corn or wheat here in Crystal City. We made
glass,'' he remembered. ``Today I want to be as clear as that glass
about who I am....''
</P>
<P>
   Residents said the event was the biggest thing to happen to the
town of 4,000 about 30 miles south of St. Louis since the 1993
Mississippi River flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime type thing,'' said Lew Penrod of
neighboring Festus.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley used his 33-minute address to formally introduce himself
to voters, many of whom know little about him other than he once
was a star forward with the New York Knicks. Wednesday night,
Bradley led reporters on a tour that included stops at the Taylor
Avenue home where he grew up, a house Bradley still owns. Another
stop was at the nearby Crystal City State Bank, where his father
spent his career.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 56, described himself as a small-town boy who had a
paper route and could tell the time by the sound of passing trains.
</P>
<P>
   He described his late father, Warren Bradley, as a man who
worked his way up at the bank from a job ``shining pennies'' to
majority shareholder. Suffering from calcified arthritis in his
spine, the elder Bradley was unable to drive a car or throw a ball.
His wife dressed him each day and the younger Bradley, an only
child, tied his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest achievement, Warren Bradley once said, was never
foreclosing on a home during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always managed to work something out,'' Bill Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Susie Bradley, also dead, was as exuberant as his
father was reserved. She taught Sunday School at the Presbyterian
church across the street and organized a never-ending string of
activities for her son and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator, Bradley said, he tried not to hog the spotlight
and sought to reach across party lines to get things done. Both
attributes were present during Bradley's work on the sweeping
tax-reform act of 1986 that reduced the number of tax brackets.
Members of both parties credited Bradley for his work on the
complex but momentous issue.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Bradley led the crowd into the school gym
where he scored 3,066 points for the Crystal City High Hornets
during his four-year career. On a stage at one end of the gym,
friends and relatives stood to tell stories about the candidate and
town legend for his athletic and academic prowess that won him an
Olympic gold medal and a Rhodes Scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood friend Eddie Evans, an African-American, told how
Bradley once stood and told their Little League teammates that they
didn't have to eat in a restaurant in another Missouri town that
would not serve Evans. The team could eat bologna sandwiches and
potato chips and still win, which the team did.
</P>
<P>
   Evans also recounted how as a fifth- or sixth-grader, Bradley
told him he would be president one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `From a small town like Crystal City?' And he said,
`It can happen,' '' Evans recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bradley drew the loudest applause for his
references to the Clinton administration. Without ever mentioning
the president by name, Bradley said he was more interested in
leadership ``than polls and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we need a new kind of leadership in America, a
leadership that puts the people front and center _ not the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said, ``There are two kinds of politicians: those who
talk and promise and those who listen and do. I know which one I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Bradley will hop into a bus that will take him to
Hannibal and then to Iowa, the state that holds the nation's first
presidential test with its January caucuses.

TWO BIZARRE INCIDENTS SNARL BOTH COMMUTES ON I-5 IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GORDY HOLT AND PHUONG LE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Two bizarre occurrences on Interstate 5 snarled
morning and afternoon traffic in Seattle Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One left a man dead, the other left commuters simply perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, a man lost control of his Jeep Cherokee and
plummeted through an opening between the I-5 northbound express
lane and southbound main line just north of the Mercer Street exit.
</P>
<P>
   He died on impact when his Jeep fell more than 100 feet to the
ground below, said Sgt. T.J. Johnson of the Washington State
Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did not know how wide the gap was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a once-in-a-million type of thing,'' Johnson said of the
5 p.m. accident.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, commuters witnessed another bizarre event when a
transsexual from Olympia stood atop a 180-foot-high transmission
tower off I-5 at the south end of the Ship Canal Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Topless much of the time, 37-year-old Ara Tripp appeared to
dance her heart out as 120,000 volts of electricity coursed past
her shin.
</P>
<P>
   She danced. She swayed. She stripped to the waist and even spit
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was lucky,'' said Seattle City Light spokesman Steve
Fisher. ``A wrong one and she would have been toast.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking a swig from a jug she'd carried up the tower, she
spit out an impressive fireball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she took a bow,'' said Mariel Damaskin, an East Fairview
Avenue resident who watched most of Tripp's performance through her
husband's telescope at home.
</P>
<P>
   While entertaining for those who watched from below and from the
freeway deck, her performance backed up traffic for miles and
caused City Light to turn off the electricity to 5,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon accident happened as the victim sped northbound in
the I-5 express lane. He lost control as he tried to change lanes
to the left, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver broadsided the west barrier of the express lanes,
crossed over a gap to the southbound lanes, struck a lamp post and
plummeted through an opening.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of a white Mercedes swerved out of his path but no
other cars were involved.
</P>
<P>
   There were no other injuries, Johnson said, and the victim's
name was not released.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did it go through that concrete?'' asked Jim Long, who
said he heard a ``big boom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of that happening, never down the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, meanwhile, did not respond to an interview request, but
an acquaintance, KZOK radio program director Carey Curlop, said
Tripp has publicly acknowledged being transgendered.
</P>
<P>
   She is a fan of the classic rock station and regularly attends
KZOK's special events, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a transsexual,'' Curlop said. ``But all I know about
today is that a friend of hers called our morning show people and
told us she was up on that pole making a big scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know she does the fire-eating thing because she's done it
for us at some of our events. I also understand she's worked in
construction and has experience climbing on those sorts of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want to make one fact clear: We had no involvement nor
prior knowledge of this event. This is nothing we would have
sanctioned, believe me. She did this all on her own volition.''
</P>
<P>
   George Bakan, senior editor at Seattle Gay News, described Tripp
as ``a nice person; very outward, and always on the front line of
political and social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakan acknowledged Tripp's ``journey'' from male to female,
adding, ``but I don't know what that has to do with what she did
today. What I can tell you is that she is much appreciated for the
work she does in the gay, lesbian and transgender communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's performance Wednesday was a show stopper on I-5, where
an accident closed two left-hand lanes.
</P>
<P>
   But the interruption also sent an overflow into side streets
that became so clogged that a helicopter had to be called in to
transport the critically injured victim of a wreck at 12th Avenue
Northwest and Holman Road _ less than a dozen miles away in
Ballard. Ambulances couldn't reach the accident site, said
Harborview Medical Center spokesman Larry Zalin.
</P>
<P>
   City Light's Fisher said Tripp's stunt forced the utility to cut
service to about 5,000 customers, most of them south of the canal
in neighborhoods along Eastlake Avenue, in Montlake and on the
north side of Capitol Hill. A few customers in Wallingford, on the
canal's north side, also lost power, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Power was restored by 9 a.m., after Tripp climbed down and gave
herself up to police.
</P>
<P>
   She descended as she had ascended, wearing short cutoff jeans, a
white sleeveless tank-top and a red bandana to pin her hair.
</P>
<P>
   Police took her to King County Jail, where she was charged with
criminal trespass and indecent exposure. She could face up to a
year in jail and a $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   She was released after posting $690 bail.

MEXICO WANTS MEETING WITH U.S. LABOR CHIEF ON APPLE WORKERS'
RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Mexican government agency, citing what it says is evidence of
widespread abuse of workers' rights in Washington's apple industry,
has asked for a meeting with U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman to
talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   The charges could lead not only to a meeting with Herman, but to
hearings in Washington state by a panel of U.S. and Mexican
government officials, an investigation by a special committee of
independent experts, and even possible sanctions on Washington
apple exports to Mexico, a U.S. Labor Department spokesman
confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued by Mexico's National Administrative Office cited
allegations of workers' rights abuses under the North American
Agreement on Labor Cooperation and the labor side agreement to the
North American Free Trade Agreement, said Bob Zachariasiewicz, the
Labor Department's spokesman for international labor affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with the report is a request from Mexico's Secretary of
Labor Mariano Palacios Alcocer for formal consultations with
Secretary Herman,'' Zachariasiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in Spanish and is being translated. It is currently
under consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   The request for consultation is an early step in a process set
up under the two international labor agreements, said Lance Compa
at the International Labor Rights Fund, based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican National Administrative Office report charges that
there is a lack of legal protection for farmworker union organizing
and alleges management threats and intimidation against workers'
organizing efforts in Washington orchards and in packing and
shipping operations, Compa said.
</P>
<P>
   Compa said the report charges discrimination against migrant
workers in housing, health care, workers' compensation and in other
programs. The report claims budget cuts in U.S. enforcement
agencies such as the National Labor Relations Board and
Occupational Safety and Health Administration have resulted in
letting the problems go unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gempler of the Washington Apple Growers League in Yakima
said he had been waiting for a response from Mexico's National
Administrative Office to the labor rights complaint, but that he
had not seen its report citing evidence of abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This process is new to us and it is not understood by many,''
Gempler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our contention all along is that the United States has
substantial labor laws protecting workers and that the federal and
the more stringent state laws are enforced here. I would be
surprised if there is a finding that there was inadequate labor
protection to Washington farm workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of health and safety violations ``don't hold up,''
Gempler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industrial insurance rates and accidents have been going down
and we feel that is evidence of improvement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He called the Mexican report ``an unusual, high-profile tactic''
tied to a union vote next week at one of two apple packing plants
involved in Teamster union organizing efforts. Labor law violation
complaints remain before the National Labor Relations Board at the
other plant.
</P>
<P>
   Compa, a professor at Cornell University's School of Industrial
and Labor Relations who is advising the labor rights fund, said the
complaint against the state's apple industry was filed in May 1998
on behalf of some of the 60,000 Mexican and Mexican-American
farmworkers and human rights groups in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also accompanied a group of apple industry workers to Mexico
who provided information to the Mexican government in connection
with the complaint,'' Compa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody hopes this doesn't get to the point of hearings or
sanctions. We certainly hope some resolution is achieved respecting
workers' rights. I think showing some commitment to progress would
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor rights fund was one of three organizations, along with
the Teamsters union and United Farm Workers of America, that backed
the complaint, accusing the Washington apple industry of routinely
violating rights of Mexican and Mexican American apple pickers and
packers and threatening their health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-page complaint was initiated as the Teamsters attempted
to organize apple workers in Wenatchee and Yakima packing plants
and as the United Farm Workers attempted to organize orchard
workers. Part of the complaint centers on alleged efforts by
growers to discourage workers from joining the unions.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican National Administrative Office has been
investigating allegations in the complaint since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Release of its report was delayed until now by personnel changes
in Mexico's department of labor, said Pharis Harvey, director of
the International Labor Rights Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico had been one of the largest markets for Washington apple
exports until a 100 percent tariff was imposed after Mexican
growers charged that Washington growers were ``dumping'' apples
there at low prices.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Gary Locke led a trade delegation to Mexico last
month seeking to boost apple exports to Mexico and encourage
Mexican government officials to drop the tariff.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Lemus Gas, Mexico's consul in Seattle, said he is
attempting to obtain additional information about his government's
report and the next steps in the process under the international
labor agreements.

   NIGERIA-TRANSFORMATION (Lagos, Nigeria) _ Three months after
Africa's most populous nation inaugurated its first civilian
government in 16 years, gas stations offer perhaps the clearest
promise of what could become one of the most remarkable political
transformations on the continent. Only 15 months ago, Nigeria was
in the grip of a rapacious military regime that had turned the
country into an international pariah. Now most gas stations operate
the way an Agip station on Iju Road here does: motorists pull up to
a pump and drive away a minute later. By Norimitsu Onishi.

   SCI-NY-ENCEPHALITIS (New York) _ It was just the kind of call
New York City Health Department officials had been encouraging
doctors to make about cases with a perplexing diagnosis. The Queens
doctor told them that she had two elderly patients showing unusual
forms of muscle weakness and disorientation. She thought it might
be Guillain-Barre syndrome, a form of progressive paralysis, or
botulism, the deadly food toxin. It also sounded like encephalitis,
but it did not fit the profile for Eastern equine, the type
occasionally seen here. That call, on Aug. 23, set in motion

in the Iowa straw poll some of Quayle's aides have signed on to

Dorothy Cullman is a bit of both. ``I love change,'' said Mrs.
Cullman, 75, with visceral relish, as though she were describing
her favorite food, the kind you have to dig out of a shell. She was
sitting on her new porch in Sag Harbor, N.Y., relaxed but by no
means retired after the year of renovations that created the home _
her third. By William L. Hamilton.

INTERNET PROVIDER POLL GIVES NOD TO UPSTARTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   AGOURA HILLS, Calif. _ MindSpring Inc., a fast-moving upstart in
the world of the Internet, scored a body blow against industry
powerhouse America Online in a survey released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based MindSpring, which invites potential customers to
``Escape AOL!'' ranked highest in overall customer satisfaction
among the seven largest national Internet Service Providers,
according to a J.D. Power and Associates survey.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, three long-established brands ranked below average:
America Online; CompuServe, an AOL subsidiary; and Prodigy, one of
the first ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring received above-average scores in all seven categories
with the survey takers giving heaviest weight to price (37 percent)
and speed (29 percent).
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring, which has more than 1 million customers and recently
launched a marketing blitz that features the tag line ``You'd be
happier using MindSpring,'' blew away the competition with an
overall score of 118, followed by Pasadena-based EarthLink Network
with 110, AT&AMP;T WorldNet with 107 and Microsoft Network with 103.
J.D. Power did not issue score totals for the trio that finished
below average.
</P>
<P>
   ``MindSpring and EarthLink are both regarded in the Internet
world as very cutting edge,'' said media analyst Kevin Skislock of
Laguna Research Partners. ``Being an ISP is a very fluid situation
that requires constant creativity, because everyone on the Net has
to stay fresh and relevant. Right now, the Internet is the closest
thing to perfect competition.''
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring also generated strong responses in customer
care/technical support, e-mail services and navigation/access to
other portals. Survey takers assigned an overall importance of 7
percent to customer support and 6 percent each to e-mail and
navigation.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that 12 percent of users have a ``strong
intention'' to switch ISPs in the next 12 months and an additional
22 percent might consider switching; the most critical factors that
could cause them to switch are speed (81 percent) and price (68
percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of surprised that people are so sensitive to the
speed issue,'' said Joan Barten Kline, director of research and
operations for the telecommunications services group at Agoura
Hills-based J.D. Power. ``I had expected customer service and
technical support would be more important.''
</P>
<P>
   The results reflect potentially significant difficulties for AOL
in maintaining loyalty among its more than 18 million customers,
since AOL is among the most expensive commercial ISPs and it has
been plagued with connection problems. As Internet customers become
more familiar with using the World Wide Web, they could flock from
AOL just as Madison Avenue brings the full force of its marketing
savvy to the ISP world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ISP does something customers don't like, they'll desert
you,'' Skislock noted. ``The AOL pop-up ads have become an issue
and I think AOL may have to find a new way to connect with revenue
streams. With the Internet, we're still in the days where it's like
in the old TV shows where you crank the telephone receiver and ask
the operator if she can connect you to Mildred.''
</P>
<P>
   Many current and former AOL users complain that logging on is
difficult _ and sometimes impossible _ because the AOL dial-ups are
frequently busy. That's allowed smaller ISPs like MindSpring or
even smaller regional ISPs to often offer more consistent access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never seriously considered using AOL because the word of
mouth on it was pretty negative,'' said Victoria Alexander, an
Escondido advertising copywriter who uses MGC Communications, a
local telecom operator, as her ISP. ``It's become real easy to
switch ISPs and I've found you get much better results with the
smaller ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for America Online and MindSpring were
unavailable for comment late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing an ISP can be a daunting task. According to TheList at
Internet.com, there are more than 7,600 ISPs to choose from,
although most offer service only in selected regions of the country
or to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Which one should customers choose? That depends upon the
customers' needs. First-time Net surfers are usually best served by
ISPs like AOL, that offer expanded service and easy-to-use
navigation around their own Web site and online.
</P>
<P>
   Most ISPs come at a price typically around $20 a month for
unlimited access, but cheaper, hourly rates are available. For
those who don't want to pay at all, Westlake Village-based NetZero
offers free Internet access with one catch: ads. Once a NetZero
customer has logged on, a small ad window appears on the customer's
computer screen and although the ads change, they won't go away
until the customer logs off.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Snow, a Los Angeles-based screenwriter, said he relies on
Los Angeles Free-Net as an ISP because its annual fee is only $40.
``Free-Net is totally functional,'' he added. ``Even though I'm
phenomenally busy, I'm not phenomenally rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Kline said the top seven ISPs accounted for more than half of
the residential ISP subscriptions in the United States. She noted
that the survey, conducted online earlier this year, also found
that local and regional ISPs generated above-average customer
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``By targeting their offering toward the community _ including
sponsorship of nonprofit sites, local community news, sporting and
cultural event calendars _ these providers are treating their
Internet product as a value-added service for their existing
customer base,'' Kline added.

RANGERS' BURKETT KEEPS INDIANS PUZZLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Cleveland Indians lead the world in runs
scored, have a roster filled with All-Stars and
most-valuable-player candidates and own the best record in the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that last night, in the most dramatic moment of
the game, brought a guy with 143 runs batted in off the bench to
pinch hit for a guy with just 92 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all their offensive firepower, the Indians have somehow
become totally befuddled by Rangers pitcher John Burkett.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, with a huge assist from reliever Tim Crabtree, mastered
the Indians for the second time in three weeks, pitching the
Rangers to a 3-0 victory at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, with 62/3 scoreless innings last night, has won two of
those games, beating Cleveland, 6-1, on Aug. 18 at Jacobs Field.
He's held them to one run on 12 hits in 142/3 innings and has
struck out 15. He has a 0.57 earned-run average against the Indians
and a 6.00 ERA against the Anaheim Angels, the worst hitting team
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just weird,'' Burkett said. ``Like the Yankees beating me
up lately. It seems like when I go against these guys, I have my
good stuff. When I go against the Yankees, everything is right down
the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, in sweeping the two-game series, have won five of
their past six games against the Indians and have pulled within two
games of them in the race for the best record in the American
League. They are 7-3 against the Indians this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can beat us all year long,'' Indians outfielder Richie
Sexson said. ``If they don't beat us in the playoffs, it doesn't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, showing his veteran savvy, won his two games against
the Indians with two styles. He relied on his fastball in
Cleveland, last night he went more with his off-speed pitches down
in the strike zone. The Indians could hardly touch him either way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has pitched back-to-back games as well as you can against
that ballcub,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``When he's in a
groove like that, he can throw any pitch where he wants too.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, leaving with a 3-0 lead with two out in the sixth,
received a thunderous standing ovation from 29,889 fans as he
walked off the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a nice feeling,'' Burkett said. ``I really don't pay
attention to that stuff but tonight was weird. When I was warming
up and they announced the battery _ Ivan Rodriguez catching,
Burkett pitching _ I happened to hear the boos. It was a nice
feeling to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   The ovation was just as loud for Crabtree a few minutes later in
the decisive moment of the game. Burkett, after allowing a one-out
single to Einar Diaz and a two-out double Omar Vizquel, left the
game with runners at second and third. Mike Venafro took over and
walked Roberto Alomar to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Jim Thome but Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove,
avoiding lefty vs. lefty, pinch hit Manny Ramirez, the American
League RBI leader who was getting a night off. Oates countered with
Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically wanted to come with my best pitch, my fastball,''
Crabtree said.
</P>
<P>
   He did and the fans roared when he threw the first pitch for
strike one. They rose to their feet and got louder with each pitch
until Crabtree threw a 1-2 fastball by him for strike three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fired up,'' Crabtree said. ``That was fun. That was
playoff atmosphere. Even though it was a small crowd, the crowd was
loud and gave me a little extra. Hopefully that was a preview of
the playoff. That's what the playoffs are all about.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PHILADELPHIA _ For all the times the Astros' pitching staff has
bailed out a season bordering on disaster, the offense more than
returned the favor Wednesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hitters were so good, they practically gave Mike Hampton the
night off.
</P>
<P>
   An anticipated pitching duel between All-Stars Hampton and Curt
Schilling turned lopsided as the Astros erupted for nine runs in a
sixth inning highlighted by home runs from Jeff Bagwell and Daryle
Ward for a 10-2 rout of the Phillies before a crowd of 14,050 at
Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros posted their sixth straight win and maintained a
three-game lead over Cincinnati in the National League Central.
They will try to complete a perfect seven-game road trip here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (19-3) pitched seven scoreless innings to tie teammate
Jose Lima for the league lead in wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the least we can do for all of our pitching staff,''
second baseman Craig Biggio said of the nine-run outburst, the
club's largest single-inning scoring frenzy in four years. ``If it
wasn't for them, we wouldn't be in the situation we are in. It's
nice to go out and score runs because it gives them some breathing
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Through five innings, Hampton and Schilling (15-6) were locked
in a one-run duel. Then the Astros put a crack in the Phillies'
staff the size of the fissure in the Liberty Bell a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros in the sixth inning had eight hits and sent 14
batters to the plate against three pitchers, running up a 10-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The nine runs were the most by the Astros in an inning since a
nine-run eighth inning on July 25, 1995, against the Chicago Cubs.
The club record for runs in an inning is 12, set against the
Phillies in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   What impressed manager Larry Dierker after the game wasn't how
much the Astros scored but against whom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (scoring a lot of runs) helps to ease the tension when you
come out and look at the scoreboard and know the Reds have already
won and you're facing Schilling,'' Dierker said. ``We felt we had
at least a 50-50 chance with Hampton going out there.''
</P>
<P>
   After Biggio put the Astros ahead 1-0 with a home run in the
third, Schilling self-destructed when he hit Bagwell with a pitch
with one out in the sixth. Ken Caminiti walked, and Ward cracked
his sixth home run far up into the right-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who was making only his second start since coming off
the disabled list Sept. 2, was charged with four runs and five hits
over 5 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got four (runs) off Schilling, and I didn't even expect to
get that,'' Dierker said. ``All the bonus runs were also somewhat
unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Billy Brewer let the game get away completely, allowing
five of the six batters he faced to reach base.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Berkman walked, Paul Bako hit a double to right-center and
Tim Bogar was intentionally walked to get to Hampton, who lined an
RBI single. Biggio hit a sacrifice fly, and Bill Spiers added an
RBI single to make it 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell then cranked a three-run shot off Carlton Loewer for his
40th home run. It marked the second time in his career Bagwell has
reached 40; he hit a career-high 43 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get nine runs in an inning, you have to be really
excited because it doesn't happen very often,'' Biggio said.
``Everybody contributed.''
</P>
<P>
   Loewer walked two more batters before Berkman grounded out to
end the inning, drawing a sarcastic round of cheers from the crowd
that remained.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in five days that Philadelphia _ which
has lost 12 of 13 games _ had allowed nine runs in an inning.
Cincinnati scored nine in the fifth inning of a 22-3 blowout
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-run cushion was more than enough for Hampton, who posted
his 10th straight winning decision since June 24. He allowed five
hits while walking three and striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   He had nothing but praise for the Astros' bats following the
game. And he should. In Hampton's 29 starts this season, the Astros
are averaging 6.2 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some pitchers struggle a little bit with big leads because
they don't focus as well,'' Hampton said. ``With me it just makes
me relax a little bit more. I can't say enough about the offense
tonight. They scored some runs off a great pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the story of the whole season. Everybody comes
to play when I pitch. They play their best games when I'm on the
mound. It's a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching Hampton all season, Biggio offered his
endorsement for the Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is as good as anybody in the league right now,'' Biggio
said. ``To me, as far as Cy Young is concerned, he's leading it
right now. He's given us quality start after quality start.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade Miller pitched the final two innings and lost the shutout
on a two-out, two-run homer in the ninth by Torey Lovullo, who had
three of the Phillies' eight hits.

YANKEES COULD BE THE BEST PLAYOFF MATCH? YES, REALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Hit rewind. Go back a couple of months to the
All-Star Game break. Listen to the local chatter from fans and
media. Everybody was already talking October. Talking about the
playoffs. And asking even then for benevolence from the baseball
gods.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't let it be the Yankees again in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be sure you get it right,'' Rafael Palmeiro requested last
night at The Ballpark in Arlington. ``That was fans and that was
media saying that. You never heard it in this room. The players
don't have Yankees phobia, but we may be the only ones within a
hundred miles who don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's probably 200 miles, but Palmeiro brings up an
interesting point now that October is creeping closer.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, or look up the Rangers' postseason record, but
the Yankees ain't that good. September has become a struggle for
the mighty ones. The pitching staff, mainly the rotation, is
extremely erratic.
</P>
<P>
   Where's that shut-em-down ace? It's not Roger Clemens, who can't
string together decent starts. It's not the always dependable David
Cone, who appeared to have an ailing wing when the Yankees were
last in Arlington. Cone is a Rangers killer deluxe, but he's
limping through September by working only once a week. It was true.
Cone was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Don't spread it around, but maybe the Yankees are the ``best''
club for the Rangers to open the postseason against. Sure, I'm
crazy. But that's not the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Or would it be better to play Cleveland? Still got the best
record in the American League, but there's always something about
the Chief Wahoos that ignites the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another win last night, 3-0. Rangers sweep the two-game set,
and go 7-3 against Cleveland in the season series, plus 28-16 since
1996. And just when you think John Burkett might never win another
game, the Indians come along.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett worked a masterful 6 2/3 innings last night, and in two
starts against Cleveland since mid-August has snuffed the league's
highest scoring team, allowing one run in 14 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett vs. the Indians is another amazing development in an
amazing season for the Rangers. And Burkett vs. the Indians in the
playoffs? It sounds inviting. As does playing Cleveland in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what's our record against them going to mean in October?''
Palmeiro said. ``Not one thing, really. The postseason doesn't work
that way. Cleveland is a good club now. Good clubs become even
better in the playoffs. Does everybody in Cleveland have Rangers
phobia? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   From another part of the clubhouse came the voice of Mark
McLemore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want those Yankees,'' smiled the second baseman, obviously
mocking local Yankees phobia. ``I want those Yankees,'' he
repeated. ``I also want to play Cleveland or Boston. And then I
want to play Atlanta or Houston or the Mets. Does it make any
difference? No. We will be playing somebody. You've got to beat
them all.''
</P>
<P>
   It is typically with amusement when players discuss the Yankees
obsession heard from fans and media because of two ousters in the
past three playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are no more a topic with \Rthe players\S than any
other team,'' Palmeiro said. ``The only time we talk about them is
when we're asked by the media.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To say we would have a phobia about the Yankees indicates
we're scared,'' McLemore added. ``If anybody is scared, they should
go home. There was no phobia last October. They were better than
everybody else. They beat us. Then they beat everybody else. But
that was then. And that doesn't matter anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If playoff matchups do matter next month, then the team to
dodge, be it the Rangers, Yankees or Cleveland, is actually wild
card Boston. The Pedro Martinez factor is a very real fear.
</P>
<P>
   Among the four clubs, there's only one dominating rotation guy _
Pedro. In a five-game series, he could beat you twice. Stay away
from those kind.
</P>
<P>
   So, go right ahead. Bring on the Yankees. Unless, of course,
it's Cleveland. Otherwise, there could be a serious local epidemic
from fans and media known as Pedro phobia.

RAIN DELAYS, ODD PLAYS WRECK DODGERS

<P>
   MIAMI _ Bad teams pay for their sins in September.
</P>
<P>
   They play long into the night with nobody watching, counting the
innings until they can go home for good.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of innings for the Los Angeles Dodgers and
Florida Marlins on Wednesday night at Pro Player Stadium. Extra
innings, blown saves and three rain delays that totaled more than
three hours.
</P>
<P>
   When it finally ended with a 5-4 Dodgers' loss in 13 innings,
the night was just beginning. The team had to fly back across
country to face the streaking New York Mets tonight at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm not on a flight back to L.A.,'' said Marlins
manager John Boles, who beat the Dodgers seven of nine times this
season. ``If you lose this game, it's one of the worst days you can
imagine. If you win, it's a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers ended their six-game trip with three consecutive
losses that included more than seven hours of rain delays. All this
after sweeping the Cubs at Wrigley Field last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago seems like a long time ago,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``The bottom line was we just didn't close it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the rain delays, Jeff Shaw blew a save in the ninth and
Alan Mills blew one in the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth's error in left hurt Shaw, but there was so
much more.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins used a franchise-record 24 players. The Dodgers used
21.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi, Eric Karros and Davon White went a combined 2 for
16 at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dodgers' play at the end was as sloppy as the field. The
worst came in the 13th after Marlins shortstop Dave Berg opened
with a walk. Pinch hitter Chris Clapinski rolled an infield hit
between first base and the mound. Onan Masaoka (2-4), the Dodgers'
seventh pitcher, picked up the ball and threw wildly to first. Berg
wound up on third and scored the winning run on a single by Mark
Kotsay.
</P>
<P>
   Until Preston Wilson tied it with a 435-foot homer off Mills to
open the 12th, the game looked like a triple bust for the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have they sat through 17 rain delays and three
postponements this season, they lost their second baseman Luis
Castillo and outfielder Todd Dunwoody for the season with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, who entered the game batting .303, separated his left
shoulder diving for Hollandsworth's ninth-inning single to the
right side. Hollandsworth later scored on a sacrifice fly to tie
the game at three and send it into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been too simple to end the game there.
</P>
<P>
   One out after Wilson's homer, Kotsay doubled to right. Mills
then loaded the bases with walks to Derrek Lee and Ramon Castro.
That set up the weirdest play of the night. Masaoka got ahead 1-2
on Dunwoody in the count, then struck him on the right hand with a
pitch, fracturing Dunwoody's thumb. It looked like Kotsay would
trot home with the winning run. But home-plate umpire Mark
Hirschbeck ruled that Dunwoody went around, making it strike three.
</P>
<P>
   Mills then struck out Fredi Gonzalez to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers appeared to win it in the 12th when Adrian Beltre
opened with a hustling double to shallow center. He moved to third
on a fly ball to center and scored on Jose Vizcaino's infield out.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than five hours after Dodgers starter Chan Ho Park
walked four in the first two innings and allowed two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Paul LoDuca tied the game in the second with a two-run single
off Marlins starter Michael Tejera.
</P>
<P>
   Park, in search of his fourth consecutive victory, walked five
in four innings. For the next six innings neither team scored, but
that doesn't mean nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the fourth, the rain resumed and halted the
game for 23 minutes. Park came back out to finish the inning, but
he was lifted for a pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the sixth, the rain returned and stopped play for
one hour and three minutes.

DIFFICULT OFFSEASON HAD PARALLELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ohio State linebacker Na'il Diggs was preparing
for a preseason workout when he learned UCLA had suspended seven
starters for two games because of the disabled-parking scandal.
</P>
<P>
   His reaction: a mixture of surprise and sympathy. It wasn't a
pleasant offseason in Columbus, either. Academics, not parking
placards, were the talk of the town and reflected a team in
transition. A team with unproven players on defense and a
quarterback platoon. A team desperate to shake a loss to Miami. A
team, in sum, that looks very much like UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State's turmoil began last spring when junior guard Rob
Murphy, a consensus All-American, was declared academically
ineligible and released from his scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Then in midsummer, two reserves and six incoming freshmen became
academically ineligible. Three of the freshmen were expected to
contribute this season.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a few days before the Aug. 29 Kickoff Classic against
Miami, starting linebacker Courtland Bullard was suspended for one
game for violating team rules, and reserve linebacker Chris Kirk
became academically ineligible for the season. Dazed and depleted,
the Buckeyes lost 23-12 and dropped out of the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freshmen definitely could have helped and we missed
Courtland in that first game,'' Diggs said. ``I know UCLA misses
its guys, too. It's been tough. Hopefully, we can rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   The parallels don't stop with summer suspensions. Both UCLA and
Ohio State were one quarter away from playing for the national
title last year: for the Bruins, the fourth in Miami; for the
Buckeyes, the fourth against Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams must replace their best defensive players, their best
offensive lineman and most important, their starting quarterbacks.
As UCLA searches for Cade McNown's successor, Ohio State hunts for
Joe Germaine's heir.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, while the Bruins rotate Drew Bennett and Cory
Paus, the Buckeyes platoon Austin Moherman and Steve Bellisari. At
least the Bruins have picked a starter (Bennett). Buckeyes coach
John Cooper hasn't named one, although Moherman, a sophomore from
Mission Viejo, was more effective against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have loved to have played UCLA last year,'' Cooper said.
``It would have been a shootout.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the parallels, there is one significant difference
between the teams: One team is UCLA and one is Ohio State. Where
the Buckeyes are, the Bruins want to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes have won 43 games in the last four years and played
in five consecutive New Year's Day bowl games. They've produced 13
All-Americans and 11 first-round draft picks in the last five
years. Put another way, since 1995 the Buckeyes have had more
first-round draft picks than the Bruins have had draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   Summer suspensions and rookie quarterbacks might be a viable
excuse in Westwood but not in Columbus _ not when your associate
athletic director is the only two-time Heisman Trophy winner,
Archie Griffin, and not when your stadium abuts Jesse Owens Plaza,
which intersects Woody Hayes Drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes have lived this predicament before. They won 11
games in 1995, then lost quarterback Bobby Hoying, tight end Ricky
Dudley, receiver Terry Glenn and Heisman Trophy winner Eddie George
to the NFL. The following season, they again won 11 games and beat
Arizona State in the Rose Bowl. That's not rebuilding. It's not
even reloading. It's just pulling the trigger again and again _ and
not many programs can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if all 22 starters are freshmen and
sophomores,'' Diggs said. ``The fans still expect a Big Ten title
every year, and the coaches and players expect no less.''
</P>
<P>
   Which explains public reaction to Ohio State's uninspired
Kickoff Classic. Letters to the Columbus Dispatch last week
described Cooper as a ``dumb hick from Tennessee'' and said he
should be ``arrested for impersonating a football coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Was the Miami loss an aberration or a sign of weekly struggles
to come? It depends not only on the quarterbacks but on the players
expected to replace linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer and four 1998
All-Americans: Murphy, receiver David Boston, safety Damon Moore
and cornerback Antoine Winfield. The Buckeyes lost more talent in
one season than most programs lose in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have players as good as Boston, Winfield, Katzenmoyer
or Germaine,'' Cooper said. ``Those guys were the best at their
positions. That's the reason there's so much uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere more than at quarterback. Moherman is a classic pocket
passer with a good arm and little mobility. Bellisari is mobile but
an inconsistent passer. Unlike UCLA's rookie quarterbacks, they
don't have proven receivers. The prime targets, Reggie Germany and
Ken-yon Rambo, have just 32 career receptions and five touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing cures early-season troubles like a week off
and then 90,000 crazies in Ohio Stadium _ where the Buckeyes
haven't lost a nonconference game in nine years. Katzenmoyer or no
Katzenmoyer, Germaine or no Germaine, suspensions or no
suspensions, the Buckeyes are gifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be coming together more in the UCLA game,'' safety
Gary Berry said. ``The Miami game was early. Morale is up. The
intensity's better. If we play our hearts out, we can get into
midseason form in no time.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what UCLA doesn't want to hear.

DAVENPORT RALLIES TO OUST PIERCE 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Defending champion and No. 2 seed Lindsay Davenport,
like Todd Martin the night before, stared down defeat at the US
Open and gets to stay around and tell about it.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport led early Wednesday, struggled in the middle, got a
few tips during a rain delay and at the end had too much for Mary
Pierce, 6-2, 3-6, 7-5. Davenport is back in Friday's semifinals and
will take on Serena Williams, who ousted Monica Seles, 4-6, 6-3,
6-2, Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport kicked off a day of entertaining matches.
</P>
<P>
   There was No. 1 seed Andre Agassi, who had his hands full with
Nicolas Escude early and then cruised, 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, 6-4 into a
semifinal against No. 3 seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always tough when you play guys who don't have much to
lose,'' said Agassi of his early problems. ``I wasn't guessing his
swings, wasn't reading his serves. It took me a little while to
feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, the winner here in 1994, is trying for his first
apppearance in the finals since 1995, when he lost to Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   There was Serena Williams, overcoming jitters and then
overpowering two-time winner and No. 4 seed Monica Seles, 4-6, 6-3,
6-2, to keep alive thoughts of an all-Williams final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 15 aces, `Wow,' '' said a jubilant Williams after her
match.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister, Venus, takes on No. 1 seed Martina Hingis in the
other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Williams got off to a fast start in the second set, but then
faltered. She was up, 4-0, when Seles rallied to win three straight
games and looked as if she might run Williams out of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Williams broke back _ when Seles double-faulted on game point _
and then served out the set. Williams broke Seles again in the
first game of the third set and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably frustrated with what happened in the second
set, after coming back from 4-love,'' Seles said. ``I think
probably Serena raised her level in the third set and I dropped
quite a few levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Richard Krajicek firing a record 48 aces. And
losing.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek came back from two sets down but lost three tiebreakers
as Kafelnikov advanced, 7-6 (7-0), 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe aces don't pay: Krajicek broke the previous mark of Goran
Ivansivec, who served up 46, also in a loss, at Wimbledon in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather hit how many he hit, 15 or something (actually 10),
and be in the semis,'' Krajicek said. ``I was serving good. He was
making me serve good. He was punishing, especially in the end,
really punishing my serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov had a strategy: ``Hang on until the tiebreaker in the
fifth set. I wasn't going to have any more chances to break his
serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov did break serve once in the first set. In the next
four sets, he had only one break point.
</P>
<P>
   But he did get to the fifth-set breaker, going up, 6-2. But then
he hit a forehand wide. Krajicek threw in ace No. 47. Then No. 48
and it was 6-5. And then Kafelnikov came up with his own ace _ his
10th _ and he was on to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The day started with Davenport's bullet-dodging.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport had been playing well and with confidence here and she
figured this victory could crank up that confidence even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I have to do is say, `You know, I should have been home
when the rain came,' '' she said. ``I should have been on my way to
Manhattan and started packing to go home tomorrow. I'm just lucky
to be there. You have to go with that. Sometimes it just turns the
tournament around and you play even better after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was on a roll and served to knock Davenport out of the
tournament at 5-4 in the third set. Pierce put away a forehand off
a short return and drilled a forehand winner, and it was match
point.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport escaped with a tough, angled backhand crossing shot.
Soon, Pierce had another and this time angled her own backhand,
just wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm human,'' Pierce said. ``I got a little bit
nervous and a little tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce hit a backhand long and a forehand into the net and then,
to add to the drama, rain held up play for 67 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport came back out, held serve, then broke Pierce, and it
was over.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ In John McEnroe's final Davis Cup tie as a player seven
years ago in Fort Worth, he and Pete Sampras staged an epic
comeback from two sets down against their Swiss antagonists,
propelling the U.S. team forth to the championship.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe swears Pete got so pumped up by the experience that he
turned to him afterward and, in the full flush of
one-for-all-and-all-for-one triumph, said: ``I love you, John.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when McEnroe was formally introduced as the new
U.S. Davis Cup captain, Mac said: ``I hope he still does.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe's long-awaited _ and, in prissy circles, long-dreaded _
appointment as America's captain, a position he has openly coveted
for years, will be defined by two things: his deportment and his
persuasiveness.
</P>
<P>
   I he can keep Sampras in the fold and convince Andre Agassi to
rejoin it, he will be a great captain. If he can't, he will be
judged a failure.
</P>
<P>
   As for his behavior, unless a McTantrum leads to an all-out
international incident that requires NATO intervention, it won't
matter in the least.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, chances are Johnny Mac will behave himself. He never
throws an obscenity-laden hissy fit on television, does he?
Assuming he resists the temptation to put a racket in his own hand,
which he contends is ``improbable,'' he'll be OK. The gaskets in
his brain seem to blow only when he perspires. Otherwise, he's a
fairly normal guy.
</P>
<P>
   Well, fairly. He has a wife (No. 2) and six (!) kids. He also
wears an earring and owns an art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   And has probably the highest profile in tennis, 15 years after
he won his last important title. Only Agassi and perhaps now the
Williams sisters are, as similarly transcendent figures, possessing
wide appeal beyond the tennis cult.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe is all over our TV screens. Pick a network, and he's on
it, either commentating or selling something. He's also all over
the National Tennis Center, where T-shirts of his design are hot
sellers. Now, with his ascension to the role of savior of the
Americans' again-lagging Davis Cup fortunes, he has ratcheted up
his profile yet another notch.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: commissioner of tennis. Don't laugh. He says tennis
needs one and that he, in his current ``more mature _ I'm 85-90
percent good, 10-15 percent dark side'' _ incarnation, should be
the man.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the Davis Cup. His goal is to make it a big, big deal
again, just below the major championships and like it used to be
years ago, when tennis mattered.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe thinks the two go hand in hand. The Davis Cup, with the
patriotic passions it inspires, is the key to bringing tennis back
to where it was during his prime. Nobody anywhere, in any country,
respects the Cup like he does. He has played more ties (30), won
more matches (41) and spent more years (12) on the U.S. team than
any American in history.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he deserved this captaincy, his obvious,
self-confessed baggage notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to be picked for the Davis Cup team,'' he said.
``It's my job to make (today's) players understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi figured to be the hard sell. In protest over past
``wrongs'' by the USTA, he has vowed never to set a sneakered foot
in a tie again. But Mac's lobbying efforts began right after
Wednesday's news conference when he lauded Andre's renewed
commitment to playing top-echelon tennis. Years ago, he was a
notorious tanker, and McEnroe ripped him for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to worry about what happened in the past,'' Mac
said. ``He's as competitive as anyone today, he's playing the best
tennis of his life, and he's fitter than he's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's response was most encouraging. He lauded the new USTA
president, Judy Levering, who is the first woman to head the
organization in its 118-year history, for seeking out the input of
the top players _ himself included _ and for paying attention to
what they told her. Mac, for his part, thanked Levering for
``having the guts'' to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``John will make a huge difference,'' Agassi said. ``Now all we
have to do is get Pete on board, and we're all good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, talking on the phone with McEnroe during the USA
network's telecast of Agassi's easy victory against Nicolas Escude
on Wednesday night, said he, too, was ``looking forward to playing
next year with Andre, Todd (Martin) and Jim (Courier),'' and spoke
of the U.S. team, under McEnroe's leadership, becoming ``a
dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete knows McEnroe will exhort, applaud and inspire. He will
beg, cajole and plead. He will, on occasion, scream, holler and bay
at the moon. He will do everything, in fact, except preach proper
decorum. It's not his, uh, area of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Conceded Johnny Mac, the erstwhile McBrat: ``I don't think Pete
will ever say, `Hey, John, how should we conduct ourselves on the
court?'''

PHILADELPHIA _ Open the gates and turn on the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Give the ball to Mike Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Line the basepaths and dust off home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Give the ball to Mike Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Sing the national anthem and turn on the radar gun.
</P>
<P>
   Give the ball to Mike Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros can only hope the retractable roof next year at Enron
Field is as dependable as Hampton, who has had more open-and-shut
cases than Jack Webb on Dragnet.
</P>
<P>
   Ten wins in a row for Hampton. Twenty-five Astros victories in
his 29 starts on the season. That isn't baseball. It's cleaning up
at a floating craps game with your own set of loaded dice.
</P>
<P>
   It's like pushing the button in the hotel lobby. You simply
expect the doors to open and the elevator to take you up. He's as
automatic as Liz Taylor's next marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consistency is what you strive for as a pitcher,'' Hampton
said. ``Not just in every inning against every batter. But you want
to be consistent every time out. You want to be able to come to the
ballpark and feel good about yourself and to have your teammates
feel good that you're the one going out to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great ones, the guys who are the real horses, are the ones
who can go out there 30 to 35 times in a season and give you 200
innings. That's what makes a guy like Curt Schilling one of the
great ones.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do these numbers make Hampton? He's now 19-3 on the
season, tied with teammate Jose Lima for most wins in the National
League. He has an ERA of 2.82. He hasn't failed to reach the
seventh inning since June. Having the Astros score 10 runs _
including nine in one inning _ with Hampton on the hill is the
equivalent of using a hatchet to remove a splinter from your
finger. Just a bit excessive.
</P>
<P>
   What it was supposed to be was a classic pitching duel between
Hampton and Schilling, and that's exactly what was delivered for
the first five innings Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Making his second start since coming off the disabled list,
Schilling looked strong at the start as his fastball was regularly
clocked in the mid-90s. His only early hiccup came with two out in
the third inning when Craig Biggio jumped on a changeup and sent it
over the left-field wall. Then Daryle Ward took him deep with a
three-run rocket to open the floodgates in the sixth, and just like
that, there was only one ace left in the duel.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of tense, close matchup the Astros were
expecting to use as an early tryout for the playoffs and one in
which manager Larry Dierker wanted to see if Hampton could keep
control of his emotions and not try to overthrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``My tendency before this year was to really get a little too
pumped up when I went against some of the really bigger names,''
Hampton said. ``And when I'd get myself into trouble, I'd try to
make a pitch that I really wasn't capable of throwing. What I've
learned this year, what's made the difference, is to have
confidence in my regular stuff and to have confidence in the guys
behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton gave up a pair of singles in the second and third
innings, but he got out of both spots by getting inning-ending
ground balls to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Hampton walked leadoff man Alex Arias on four
pitches, then came right back to get the next three men in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a few lapses in control, which are symptomatic of
Hampton,'' said Dierker. ``But he put a stop to them quickly. In
previous years, when he walked the leadoff man, sometimes he wasn't
even able to get out of the inning. Now he's grown so much in
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   And those numbers keep growing and growing into the Cy Young
Award variety. Hampton's record is better than Lima's, and so is
his ERA. Lima has given up fewer walks, but there is the carnival
sideshow part of him that could influence batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The similarity between Lima and Hampton is that they are both
intense,'' said Dierker. ``The difference is, ah, well, one is a
loud intensity and the other is a quiet intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   So sign Dierker up for a job in the diplomatic corps and get
ready to pencil in another win for the Astros the next time Hampton
takes the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about the cratering Phillies, who if they keep
falling so far off the map will soon be located just south of
Tierra del Fuego. But this was a clutch situation. By the time the
Astros took the field, the second-place Reds had already posted a
win on the scoreboard, and the Phillies were coming out with their
one bona fide ace on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to lose a game off your lead in that situation
about half the time, if not more,'' Dierker said. ``But the way
he's been going, you had to figure we had better than a 50-50
chance with Hampton.''
</P>
<P>
   He had good movement on his fastball. He mixed in his changeup
in just enough spots to keep the Phillies guessing. He got out of
the few ticklish spots he was in, and the Astros' winning streak
grew to six games.
</P>
<P>
   Another night, another money game.
</P>
<P>
   There are ATMs that don't pay out like Hampton.

ISRAEL PREPARES TO TRANSFER LAND AND BEGINS RELEASING PRISONERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs throughout for updating on release of prisoners)   (sw) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Moving to carry out its latest agreement with the
Palestinians, the Israeli government has approved the transfer of
more West Bank land to Palestinian rule and has begun the release
of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   A Cabinet vote on Wednesday, followed by an overwhelming
endorsement of the agreement in Parliament, cleared the way to
start carrying out the accord before the Jewish New Year, which
begins on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The first land handover will put another 7 percent of West Bank
territory _ about 147 square miles _ under Palestinian civil
control; Israel retains security responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Just after dawn on Thursday morning, Israel released the first
Palestinian prisoners covered under the agreement, with a total of
200 expected to be freed before the day was over. In a month, 150
more are to be freed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest agreement, which was signed on Saturday, revived the
Wye River land-for-security accord reached last October. The new
agreement calls for Israel to withdraw from a further 11 percent of
the West Bank. Together with previous pullbacks, this will leave
the Palestinians in full or partial control of 40 percent of the
territory. The pullbacks were halted in December by Benjamin
Netanyahu, then the prime minister, who accused the Palestinians of
failing to keep their security commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet approved the first land transfer by 17 to 1, with
one abstention.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers have criticized the planned withdrawals, arguing that
they will expose their communities to possible attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to his right-wing critics, Prime Minister Ehud Barak
asserted that ceding West Bank territory was a difficult step.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are separating from parts of the land that are dear to us
all,'' he told the Cabinet on Wednesday in remarks made public by
his office. ``But we are a responsible government, and we must move
toward a permanent settlement and peace agreements throughout the
region in order to consolidate Israel's security and future.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking later in Parliament, Barak struck a similar chord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep in our hearts, there is deep pain,'' he said, but he
added, ``In order to insure the future, sovereignty and strength of
Israel, we must make difficult, sometimes painful decisions to
separate peacefully from the Palestinians, to no longer rule over
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, the leader of the opposition Likud Party, urged
lawmakers to reject the latest agreement, calling it a
``disgraceful diplomatic failure'' that included new and dangerous
concessions to the Palestinians. But the accord was endorsed by a
wide margin, 54 to 23.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner release is the first step in carrying out the
accord. Israeli officials said the 200 Palestinians to be freed
first include people who had killed suspected informers or had
wounded Israelis. Their release is a break with longstanding
Israeli practice of not freeing prisoners ``with blood on their
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Barak forged ahead with his agreement, he faced a
threat by the ultra-Orthodox Shas party to bolt his coalition, a
move that would leave him without a majority in Parliament. Shas
members boycotted Wednesday's votes in the Cabinet and Parliament,
demanding that the government approve funds for Shas-run schools,
which are deep in debt. Education Minister Yossi Sarid, leader of
the secular Meretz Party, has withheld the money, saying Shas must
first correct financial mismanagement. &QL;

TV INDUSTRY EYES WAYS TO STOP BLEEDING
</HEADLINE>

(EDITORS: Daily News Staff Writer Harrison Sheppard contributed to
this story.)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hoping to preserve Los Angeles as the world's
entertainment capital, TV industry officials and Mayor Richard
Riordan launched a new campaign Wednesday to train workers in
high-tech jobs and stem the long-term threat of runaway production.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the TV industry prepared to celebrate the Emmy Awards on
Sunday in Hollywood, officials from the Academy of Television Arts
and Sciences and Riordan made plans to tap into a $70 million city
fund to keep ahead of other countries and states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is the the city of convergence and we want to see
it as the creative center of all new media,'' said Meryl Marshall,
chairwoman of the academy who attended the 90-minute meeting with
officials from Columbia-Tri Star, Ernst &AMP; Young, Korn Ferry
International and Lippen Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we want to see what can be done to keep Los Angeles as the
world's entertainment capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, who made growth and support of the entertainment
industry one of his key initiatives when elected, pledged to throw
the city's sizable resources behind training and other programs to
upgrade the skills of many workers left behind in the computer
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor asked that industry representatives return with
specific plans for retraining, behind which he could throw support
for use of city training centers and some of the $70 million in
training funds Los Angeles receives for various programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the mayor has done is challenge them to get together and
come back with solid recommendations,'' said Deputy Mayor Kelly
Martin. ``He told them government isn't going to do it for them,
but they have to tell us what they need and we'll try to help.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Martin said the state has retraining funds
available.
</P>
<P>
   Cody Cluff, director of the Entertainment Industry Development
Corp., formed by the city and county to issue film permits and
address industry matters, said he hoped to have something solid to
present to Riordan in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking to see where the jobs will be in the future and
how to best position Los Angeles as part of our unique (culture) of
entertainment and technology,'' Cluff said. ``We are looking at
what jobs will be out there and what training is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those institutions willing to help is Los Angeles Valley
College in suburban Van Nuys, which could use those grant funds to
build its new media arts academy, said college President Tyree
Wieder.
</P>
<P>
   The college has classes in all aspects of television and film
production and places interns at most of the major studios.
However, Wieder said the studios don't do enough to collaborate
with the school to make sure students are receiving the training
their future employers need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valley College is literally a few miles away from the
industry, but the industry doesn't necessarily take advantage of
that training,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers trained in Los Angeles are more likely to continue to
work in the city, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear and read that they're going other places because they
don't have the trained work force, but they haven't exactly worked
with us to say, Is your trained work force there? What can we do?''
</P>
<P>
   The school is trying to raise funds to build on a $500,000
donation received last year to centralize its television and movie
production classes into one facility, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Academy President Jim Chabin said the officials told Riordan the
industry also is concerned by the globalization, consolidations and
deregulation with the possible impact on jobs and the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Runaway production for both films and television has been an
increased preoccupation both in Los Angeles and the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to bring to his attention the concerns that our
members have and what we at the academy are doing,'' said Chabin.
``We are less focused on what has gone on in the past (than) what
can be done in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   There are differing estimates of the impact of runaway
production in the United States, ranging from a low of $573 million
in losses to as much as $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Entertainment Industry Development Corp., the
television industry alone accounts for 75,000 to 100,000 jobs and
accounts for a $15 billion a year contribution to the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In figures for the first quarter of this year, production was
down 21 percent compared with 1998, and much of that is in the
lower-budget films and movies of the week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Economic Development Corp.,
said the industry has been in a slide since its peak in February
1998 when 269,000 people worked in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job loss since then is about 28,000 and you're not talking
about the people in front of the cameras,'' Kyser said. ``It's the
people behind the cameras who are taking the hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Legislature recently approved a measure providing
tax credits for firms that do their productions in the state.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Chabin said the competition for films and high-tech industries
comes from not only outside the country _ such as Canada and
Australia _ but other cities and states.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have New York promoting its Silicon Alley and other areas
competing for business,'' Chabin said. ``I think we have to beat
the drum a little bit as we focus on the digital age.''
</P>
<P>
   Chabin said the industry is concerned with high-tech training
for its members, such as set decorators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a problem yet but a challenge,'' Chabin
said. ``An example I gave the mayor was a trip to Intel in Silicon
Valley where they were showing off these computers with virtual
sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked about what happens to set decorators in Southern
California. They said virtual sets have to be created and no one
does that in the Silicon Valley. What we see is our people learning
how to do that. We have to get the creative people in Southern
California to deliver their services.''
</P>
<P>
   Chabin added that it is not only for young people entering the
market, but for older workers who are the mainstay of the industry.

L.A.'S FLOURIDE SUIT STALLS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A group waging a legal and political battle
against fluoride in the city's water vowed to continue its fight
Wednesday after a Los Angeles Superior Court judge dealt it a
setback.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John Reid granted a motion by the city to throw out a
portion of the group's lawsuit dealing with allegations that
fluoridation is a violation of citizens' constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Los Angeles Citizens for Safe Drinking Water, cited a
right under the 14th Amendment to refuse unwanted medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The group will appeal the decision, said Jeff Green, San
Diego-based director of the statewide Citizens for Safe Drinking
Water.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the lawsuit, which will move forward, alleges group
members were denied their right to speak out fully during a City
Council meeting in January when the council approved the contract
for fluoridation chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Water and Power began adding fluoride to the
municipal water supply Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Green and about three dozen other fluoridation opponents
protested outside DWP headquarters downtown after the court hearing
Wednesday. Chanting slogans, they carried signs highlighting what
they call growing scientific evidence about adverse effects of
fluoridated water, especially on infants and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cannot back up the alleged benefits of fluoridation,''
said Paul Borraccia, spokesman and director of the group's Los
Angeles chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Group members said scientific studies in recent years indicate
fluoride can be linked to cancer, lower IQ in children and other
ill effects, include mottling of children's teeth.
</P>
<P>
   But public health officials said the group's complaints have no
factual basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make claims that are not substantiated by peer-reviewed
articles,'' said Tim Collins, dental director for public health
programs and services for the Los Angeles County Department of
Public Health. ``Fluoridation is, in my opinion, the most important
oral health measure that's ever been put in place in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said fluoridation in Los Angeles ensures that everyone
who drinks the city's water, including those too poor to receive
regular professional dental care, will get its tooth-decay
prevention benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Every U.S. surgeon general since 1945 has supported water
fluoridation, the American Dental Association says it helps prevent
tooth decay and the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta recently named fluoridation as one of the 10
most important public health measures of the century, said Collins,
who chairs the California Fluoridation Task Force, a loose
federation of pro-fluoridation groups.
</P>
<P>
   About 62 percent of the nation's water supply, furnishing water
to some 145 million Americans, is fluoridated, he said. Every
dollar spent on fluoridation saves $80 to $100 in dental care, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Hotchkiss, the assistant city attorney defending the
lawsuit, said that if opponents don't want fluoridated water they
don't have to drink it.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Rho, a DWP water quality engineer, said people can
remove the fluoridation from water through reverse osmosis membrane
filtration systems that can be installed on faucets.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 state law requires cities with more than 10,000 water
connections to fluoridate their water.

FAILED LOBSTER HEIST LANDS THREE IN HOT WATER
</HEADLINE>

BY TROY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shellfish never smelled so good to the gumshoes at
Parker Center.
</P>
<P>
   In their first catch of the season, Los Angeles Police
Department cargo-theft detectives said Wednesday that they have
arrested three men on suspicion of stealing a big rig loaded with
$1 million worth of lobster and shrimp in suburban North Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy to get them because they have been killing us,''
said Detective Robert Rivera.``All they do is steal. By having them
in jail, it's going to make our job a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reason to believe these suspects have been involved in
a variety of cargo thefts involving millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Until late Tuesday when the arrests were made, the cargo-theft
team came up with empty nets on three other cases of big-rig
seafood thefts in the city this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo heists have made Los Angeles the nation's cargo-theft
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, fish sellers have lost $3.17 million to seafood
pirates in the past three years in the city. The case was the
fourth seafood theft in the city this year.
</P>
<P>
   The men _ Mexican nationals identified as Jose Julio Virgen, 29,
and Guadalupe Gamez Lopez, 23; and Nicaragua resident Erwing Molina
Medal, 35 _ are accused of being part of a highly organized and
prolific ring that operated across Southern California, Rivera
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stole whatever they could get their hands on and sell,''
he said. ``It could be furniture, food, clothing, auto parts or
candy. You name it, they would steal it.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives have not linked Virgen, Lopez or Medal to any of the
other cases this year. The men were arrested on suspicion of grand
theft and held in lieu of $1million bail apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, 42-year-old Granada Hills resident Krzyszpof
Zapala, was overjoyed with the arrests and to get back his
refrigerated load of lobster and shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw that my truck was gone, I was really mad. We
work so hard and these kind of people working at night stealing
should get the harshest punishment,'' he said. ``I want to thank
everyone who worked on this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrests were made during a 9 p.m. raid at an auto shop and
repair business in South Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   When the suspects got wind of the police, they attempted to
leave in the big rig loaded with seafood, but they gave up without
incident when police patrol cars turned on their lights and pulled
them over, Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives seized two AK-47 machine guns and ammunition from the
auto shop shortly afterward, Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were glad they didn't threaten us with the guns,'' Rivera
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zapala, who works for Chicago-based JKC Trucking Inc., reported
to police Monday that the truck was stolen from a commercial area
in North Hills.
</P>
<P>
   He had checked on the truck periodically Sunday and noticed it
was missing Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A confidential informant tipped police to the location of the
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives were searching for a fourth unidentified suspect in
the seafood theft.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives also took Mexican resident Alvaro Rodriguez, 33, into
custody on a reckless driving warrant. He was inside the auto shop
when police pulled the big rig over and is not suspected in the
seafood theft.
</P>
<P>
   In May, unidentified thieves broke through a locked chain-link
fence in Northridge and stole a truck loaded with 43,650 pounds of
frozen halibut steaks.
</P>
<P>
   Also in May, thieves stole 44,218 pounds of canned tuna valued
at $140,000 from a truck parked in North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Another theft occurred in February in downtown Los Angeles when
a parked truck was emptied of $500,000 in fish.

MADDON MAKES HIS MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Interim manager Joe Maddon has wasted no time
putting his stamp on the club. He preaches playing aggressively and
tells his players not to be afraid to make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   In his first five games, Maddon's Angels are running more. Going
into Wednesday's game, the Angels had five steals and were caught
three times. Before Maddon stepped in, the Angels had just 57
steals in 133 games, worstin the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wants us to be aggressive,'' said shortstop Gary
DiSarcina, who got his first stolen base of the season Tuesday
night. ``He wants us to put ourselves in positions where we might
make mistakes, because if you're not doing that, you're sitting
back and being passive, waiting for things to happen. When he came
in he said to everybody, we're going to be aggressive and turn this
around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue is to not be concerned with making mistakes,''
Maddon said. ``Mistakes don't bother me as long as when we run,
it's a well-thought out and calculated play.''
</P>
<P>
   Another noticeable difference in Maddon's lineup is Tim Salmon
hitting third and Mo Vaughn cleanup. Under Terry Collins, it was
Vaughn third and Salmon fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timmy's getting hot,'' Maddon explained. ``When he gets going,
he has a high on-base percentage because he will accept his walks.
And I think that will benefit Mo.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Darin Erstad had a four-hit game Tuesday and was robbed of a
fifth hit when he lined out to the third baseman. It may be a
little late to salvage the season, as Erstad went into Wednesday's
game hitting just .244. But the improvement is something he and
hitting coach Rod Carew have been aiming for.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Rod have been working diligently all season long,''
Maddon said.``At this point the effort involved is staggering. He
wants to finish strong.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first two full major league seasons, Erstad hit .299 and
.296, butsustained injuries late in both seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are off today, then will begin an eight-game road
trip againstthe Twins and Royals Friday in Minnesota.

WASHINGTON VULNERABLE AS NEUHEISEL FACES FIRST TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah _ At the foot of the magnificent Wasatch Mountains
and the mercy of 65,000 of the cleanest, meanest hecklers in
sports, under the scrutiny of the cable-TV nation, one of the most
provocative figures in big-time college football ends nine months
of talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Neuheisel finally gets to put up or shut up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couldn't ask for a grander stage,'' he said, bravely.
</P>
<P>
   Many more than the profanity-free Mormon hostiles, seething
after enduring four consecutive defeats by the Washington Huskies
over their beloved Brigham Youngsters, want to see the new Huskies
coach fall off that stage into the orchestra pit.
</P>
<P>
   As just the fourth football coach in 42 years at Montlake and
the first who doesn't towel off with sandpaper, Neuheisel is too
young, too glib, too hip, too good-looking and too rich for a lot
of college football traditionalists. And that isn't asking anybody
from Boulder or Denver, where they really don't like him.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, the Ricky-rockers might get the first laugh
Thursday night, because Neuheisel goes into the dry heat of the
high desert with a depth chart shorter than a legless Corgi.
</P>
<P>
   The inexperienced Huskies, commencing one of their most brutal
schedules, haven't been this vulnerable in years. And on the eve of
the university's 600th victory, Neuheisel knows the milestone might
be the proverbial millstone.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night is the trial run for new coaches, a new system, a
new everything, down to freshly redone helmets. Heck, Washington
even booted out the veteran strength coach, Rick Heugli, and
longtime team physician Steve Bramwell.
</P>
<P>
   This is your football makeover, Barbara Hedges. As with any
facelift, be prepared for ugly bruisings.
</P>
<P>
   Even Neuheisel offered fair warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a long season, regardless of the outcome
(Thursday),'' he said Monday. ``We've got 10 more games. The
important thing is to be going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   That's as close as a football coach will get to saying: Duck!
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies take a tiny, sanctions-ravaged senior class into a
place where the home team wins 80 percent of its games and is
spoiling to undo the damage of four consecutive losses by an
average of 19 points, including the only defeat in a 1996 season
that went 14-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost hate Washington more than I do Utah,'' linebacker Rob
Morris, BYU's All-America candidate, told the Deseret News.
</P>
<P>
   That is a team-wide contempt, because the Huskies keep getting
in the way of BYU being taken seriously as a national power.
Actually the whole Pac-10 does: BYU is 3-10 against the conference
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   As a partial result, BYU is part of the new Mountain West
Conference, abandoning the bloated Western Athletic Conference for
a football-serious grouping that also contains the Huskies' next
opponent, Air Force. The new MWC sees itself as a West Coast rival
for recruits normally going to Pac-10 schools.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this is the first time in the series' six meetings
that neither school is ranked in the Associated Press Top 25 poll,
the national TV gig is a big deal for both schools.
</P>
<P>
   After Utah's obliteration of Washington State last weekend, the
locals would attach considerable conference pride to being up 2-0
against the coastal snobs. Although Washington is less concerned
with the Pac-10's sloppy start than its own welfare _ following a
6-6 season that included huge TV humiliations to Nebraska and Air
Force _ the school is eager to show the college football world its
controversial investment in Neuheisel, complete with
out-of-the-gate recruiting violations, was justified.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Washington needed to make a statement against BYU
was at the schools' first meeting in 1985, the year after BYU used
its milk-and-cookies schedule to win the national championship
ahead of Washington, which upset Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. The
Huskies were convinced that they would have mopped the floor, hosed
the basement and cleaned the corral with the undeserving Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   Although few are still in the program from those days, longtime
fans will recall the subsequent 31-3 pummeling in Cougar Stadium
was among the most distasteful defeats of the Don James era.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, the Huskies pitted many youngsters _ 18 sophomores
or freshmen saw duty that day _ against men, because so many BYU
players, careers delayed by Mormon missions, were 26-year-olds with
three kids, a mortgage and a Volvo wagon.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies offense was so battered that quarterback Hugh
Millen, harassed by a particularly virulent rush from three future
NFL players, suffered a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to answer your questions,'' he told reporters
afterward, ``but right now I'm having kind of a hard time recalling
some things.''
</P>
<P>
   A blessing then, and perhaps Thursday. As Neuheisel said, it's a
long season, which might help the legion of Ricky-rockers forget
his start.

NEUHEISEL'S HUSKIES DEBUT AGAINST BYU AIR ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TED MILLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah _ While every other college football team has been
playing, BYU and the University of Washington have been practicing.
Cougars linebacker Rob Morris summed it up for both squads.
</P>
<P>
   ``My head might explode before game,'' the Butkus Award
candidate told the Provo Daily Herald.
</P>
<P>
   A long preseason ends for both teams Thursday night in Cougar
Stadium when UW and BYU square off on national television in the
final game of a four-year, home-and-home series. The winner figures
to stake a claim to a national ranking.
</P>
<P>
   It's a game of debuts for UW. Rick Neuheisel will pace the
sidelines for the first time as UW's head coach. Marques Tuiasosopo
will take over as starting quarterback. Out is UW's storied
eight-man defensive front; in is a 3-4 look.
</P>
<P>
   Super-freshmen Paul Arnold, a tailback, and John Anderson, a
kicker, will transform from prep All-Americas to Division I
performers.
</P>
<P>
   Some things are new for BYU, too, including its conference
affiliation. Gone is the Western Athletic Conference, where the
Cougars won 18 championships under 28-year head coach LaVell
Edwards. Now BYU is the favorite in the Mountain West Conference's
inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   BYU will showcase seven new defensive starters and a pair of
true freshmen running backs, 220-pound Luke Staley and 230-pound
Fahu Tahi, who both have good speed to go along with their hefty
builds. They combined for 96 yards and three touchdowns in a recent
scrimmage, though both have battled nagging injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the new gives way to tradition. BYU figures to return to the
``Air Edwards'' attack of past years, with a passing game guided by
an experienced corps, including quarterback Kevin Feterik and wide
receivers Margin Hooks, Ben Horton and Jonathan Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   That feeds into a suspect Huskies pass defense, which gave up
2,984 yards last season, the worst in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of traps set,'' Neuheisel said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo takes over an offense laden with questions. The line
lacks depth, the receivers have been inconsistent and the running
game will fall to a three-man rotation among incumbent starter
Willie Hurst, Arnold and sophomore Braxton Cleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready _ we'll be ready,'' Tuiasosopo said. ``I'm
shooting for that perfect game.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said that scouting UW was difficult because of its new
staff, personnel and schemes. He said he has no choice but to
expect the unexpected from the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any idea (what Neuheisel will do), other than
what he did at Colorado,'' Edwards said. ``In the opening game, you
have no idea what's going to happen.''

LAMPKIN HOMER IN NINTH LIFTS MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Tom Lampkin used to sort dirty laundry as a Mariners
clubhouse boy. Not much has changed in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, he picked up after Jose Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning up a mess so unpleasant a hazardous waste team should
have been called in, Lampkin pulled
certain-victory-turned-certain-defeat into a surefire win as he
cracked a two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth to pull out a
4-3 decision over the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   With no outs, Lampkin drove a 1-2 pitch from reliever Billy Koch
over the right-field fence to settle a game that went from a
cold-blooded Gibson-Niekro duel to a spirited Hingis-Williams (pick
a sister) exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Crazier yet, the Mariners briefly gave some thought to having
Lampkin bunt in the ninth, something the backup catcher had failed
at in the seventh. Jay Buhner had opened the ninth with a walk, and
Shane Monahan ran for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in the dugout just waiting to get another
at-bat,'' Lampkin said. ``What else can I do? I'm not going to
screw it up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mariners manager Lou Piniella succintly, ``We let him hit
and he delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   The game-winning hit was the second for Lampkin, who had a
pinch-hit, two-run double in the ninth off Bobby Howry to beat the
Chicago White Sox 4-3 on Aug. 10. The game-ending homer was the
first for the Mariners in more than two seasons, since Russ Davis
beat Baltimore with a solo shot in the ninth, again for a 4-3
decision.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six innings Wednesday night, there were no runs,
barely any hits, as Blue Jays rookie Roy Halladay and the Mariners'
well-oiled Jamie Moyer locked in a brilliant duel.
</P>
<P>
   Over the final three frames, there were only kill shots by
40-something homer guys Ken Griffey Jr. and Carlos Delgado, each
tilting the score in his team's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat proved so unsettling to the Blue Jays, Delgado closed
the Toronto clubhouse to reporters after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a racing heart, the outcome left the Mariners with a 3-3
record on their fourth Safeco Field homestand, 18-15 overall at the
new ballpark. Just 36,971 fans were there to see it, a Safeco low
in 33 games.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin, however, was in attendance. He was there to rescue
Mesa, who came within a strike of tying a club record for saves but
ended up blowing another lead at the most inopportune moment.
</P>
<P>
   This one ranked right up there with the Safeco opener and an
ESPN Sunday game; the difference was, Senor Smoke got off the hook
this time, even was awarded the win, his second in seven decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to preserve a 3-2 lead and secure Moyer's 14th victory
and his 33rd save, Mesa got two quick outs in the ninth. He got two
strikes on the third hitter, Shawn Green. Then he crumbled. Mesa
was touched for a single by Green, then pounded for Delgado's 42nd
homer, suffering the wrath of the Safeco faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado's blast offset an eighth-inning homer by Griffey, his
44th, that countered a solo Delgado long ball in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of these homers came off the starters.
</P>
<P>
   As he has been for the past month, Moyer was nothing short of
sensational. He permitted Delgado's first homer and spaced five
other hits over eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer was aided greatly by the Mariners' defense, which backed
him with three double plays, one of which he started.
</P>
<P>
   He left after throwing 85 pitches. Piniella said the lefty told
him he was tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just throw strikes,'' said Moyer, who didn't walk anyone.
``That's what you're supposed to do. That's what we're all supposed
to do. I got in a good groove and made good pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   For certain, Halladay was no holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first-ever appearance against the Mariners, the
22-year-old Coloradoan spun a one-hitter over the first five
innings, a four-hitter over seven before he was lifted in favor of
reliever Graham Lloyd. Just one base runner reached third base
against the first-year player.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners didn't get a hit off Halladay until the third, when
he allowed a harmless infield single to Brian Hunter. Hunter nearly
got picked off first by the right-hander, who caught him leaning
and put him in a rundown. Yet Hunter slid safely into second base
with his 34th stolen base when Delgado's throw to the bag was high.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd served up Griffey's homer in the eighth, setting up Mesa's
generous pitch to Delgado in the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was match point, Lampkin.

CRUZ STRUGGLES TO REVIVE HIS CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jose Cruz Jr. was a solitary figure Wednesday as he
made his way through the visitors' clubhouse at Safeco Field. Other
players sat in clusters, engaged in spirited card games or lazily
watching a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half seasons after leaving Seattle, Cruz finds himself
virtually alone, trying to rekindle a once-promising baseball
career gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the broken finger in late June and a stint on
the disabled list. Next came a month-long banishment to the minors,
with Cruz rejoining Toronto late Monday night, flying to Seattle
only after Class AAA Syracuse had completed its season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgotten man? Maybe,'' he said. ``I don't know what I am
really. We'll see. Down, but not out.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Cruz had all of baseball talking about him when he
clubbed 26 home runs in 104 games for Toronto and Seattle combined.
He has struggled since, splitting each of the past two seasons
between the Blue Jays and the minor leagues, unable to recover his
stroke as big-league pitchers have become wise to his weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Once pegged as the final piece to a dream Mariners outfield
featuring Ken Griffey Jr. and Jay Buhner, Cruz bottomed out in his
latest trip to the minors, hitting just .146 at Syracuse. In 90
games with Toronto this season entering Thursday night, he was
hitting .228 with 11 homers and 34 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time in Triple-A was pretty tough, the low point for me
maybe professionally,'' he conceded. ``I was kind of out of it
mentally. It was like, `Why am I here?' I'm very confident in my
abilities now.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Cruz now teams with one of the two players the Blue
Jays sent to the Mariners in his trade, reliever Paul Spoljaric.
The other, reliever Mike Timlin, also has moved on and plays for
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's own Seattle days have become distant, particularly with
Safe-co Field replacing the Kingdome, his former place of Mariners
employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem like a long time ago. It seems like forever,'' he
said. ``It's different coming back here for sure. The stadium is
nice. It's got a little of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Searching for a positive in his baseball pursuits, the
25-year-old Cruz says people forget he is still relatively young
for a big-leaguer, that players like Edgar Martinez and even the
late Roberto Clemente had problems hitting early in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have just two years in the big leagues,'' he said.
``I guess part of it feels like I've been here forever. I'm still
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's contract comes up for renewal after this season and his
future with Toronto is unclear. He's out of options, meaning teams
can't easily shuttle him back and forth to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   A change of scenery might be good for him. However, Cruz insists
he's not eager to leave Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really want to go anywhere else, but I can't control
that stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BACK TO THE FUTURE: Asked for his reaction to a P-I column
calling for the removal of him as Mariners manager and general
manager Woody Woodward, Lou Piniella would not comment _ other than
to say he learned about it Wednesday while playing golf at Medina's
Overlake Golf and Country Club with Mariners president Chuck
Armstrong, chairman John Ellis and Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   PROMISES, PROMISES: Ejected from games five times in the past
five weeks, Piniella vows he will be on his best behavior the rest
of the season. No more hat-flying, dirt-kicking antics. Not even if
the protaganist is longtime rival Durwood Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   The reason?
</P>
<P>
   ``My youngest son said he doesn't like it,'' Piniella said. ``I
said, `That's it.' I'll go out and discuss a play. But I bet
(Toronto pitcher) David Wells the biggest steak he can eat at
Burns' Steakhouse in Tampa that I will not get kicked out of
another game. I'm done.''

 GORE'S STANDING AMONG LATINOS SLIPS  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush's efforts to woo Latino voters
appear to be paying high dividends six months before the 2000
presidential primary, a new poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Vice President Al Gore's support among Latinos in a
primary matchup has dropped 11 points, from 50 to 39 percent, while
Bush's has grown from 16 to 20 percent, according to the poll of
2,013 Californians by the Public Policy Institute of California
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also shows that if the 2000 presidential race were held
tomorrow, Bush would beat Gore in California, 49 to 44 percent,
with 7 percent of likely voters still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is doing as well as he is because he's appealing to
enough voters outside the Republican Party at this point to make
California competitive for the GOP _ which is no easy task,'' said
pollster Mark Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute, noting
that 1988 was the last time the GOP took California in a
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is the Democrats can't take the Latino vote
for granted in California,'' said Baldassare.
</P>
<P>
   With the March 7, 2000, presidential primary still six months
away, Bush is tied with Gore, 27 to 27, on an ``open primary'`
ballot which includes all presidential hopefuls in the two major
parties. Elizabeth Dole ranks third in voter preferences with 8
percent, followed by Bill Bradley (7 percent) and John McCain (4
percent) _ but the other contenders rank even lower, the poll
shows.
</P>
<P>
   With more than one-quarter of state voters admitting a personal
dislike of President Clinton, the poll also tracked what Baldassare
said appears to be the single biggest problem for Gore's campaign _
``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we look at independents, Central Valley and voters up for
play, we see a good number of Californians who are saying, `The
policies have been great _ but I don't like Clinton,''' said
Baldassare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dilemma for Gore in California, as well as the rest of the
nation (is that) he must remind the voters of the good things in
the economy and take credit for it,'' he said. ``But he must
distance himself from a president that a lot of Americans have
grown tired of, and turned against personally, in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other findings of the Public Policy Institute of
California poll:
</P>
<P>
   -- Education continues to rank overwhelmingly as the single most
important issue to Californians, with nearly one-third 1/3 &LR; 
 &LR; statewide naming schools as their priority. Crime (8 percent),
immigration and illegal immigration (7 percent), guns and gun
control (5 percent) and economy/jobs (3 percent) complete the top
five issues. Those numbers present a worrisome trend for Democratic
Gov. Gray Davis, who has made improving state schools and pushing
education legislation a cornerstone of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing Gray Davis has to worry about in these numbers
is that I don't see any evidence that Californians think the
schools are improving,'' said Baldassare.
</P>
<P>
   -- Californians are overwhelmingly in favor of a 2000 ballot
measure that defines marriage as a man-woman relationship. ``This
will be a very divisive issue on the ballot,'' said Baldassare, who
added that it could serve to spark a race of more conservative
voters to the ballot box for the March primary. ``Most Californians
want to keep marriage as an institution which applies to men and
women alone, and not broaden the definition,'' Baldassare said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Even after his landslide victory last year, just 2/3 &LR; 
 &LR; two-thirds of Californians can name their governor _ Davis. Their
awareness is even lower for other major state officials. Lt. Gov.
Cruz Bustamante, the state's highest ranking Latino official, is
known by just 8 percent of state residents, including 8 percent of
Latinos. Speaker of the Assembly Antonio Villaraigosa is known by 4
percent of Californians, and just 5 percent of Latinos. And only 1
percent of Californians could name the president pro Tem of the
state Senate, Democrat John Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Baldassare said that, due to the robust state of the California
economy, that may be a case of ignorance being bliss.
``Californians are in a very blissful state of mind right now, and
there's a very strong `what me worry' attitude,'' he said. ``Things
are going so well, people aren't looking for someone to point
fingers at.''
</P>
<P>
   The Public Policy Institute of California Poll was conducted in
a statewide sample of 2,013 residents, 1,585 voters and 989 likely
voters from August 26 to September 3; the margin of error ranges
from plus or minus 2 percentage points for the general sample, to
plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for the likely voters.

BUSH SAYS HE MISUNDERSTOOD ILLEGAL-IMMIGRATION QUESTION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The presidential campaign of Texas Governor George W. Bush
retreated Wednesday from a controversial statement that the federal
government should not reimburse states for the costs of illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign's response _ issued five days after his
comments were first published in The Chronicle _ said he
misunderstood the reporter's question.
</P>
<P>
   It followed a sharp reaction by critics who said they were
shocked at the GOP front-runner's statement that as president, he
would not reimburse California for the costs of services and
education for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush misunderstood the reporter's question about
reimbursing states for all the costs of illegal immigration,''
according to the campaign statement released Wednesday. ``He
thought the question was about whether the federal government
should reimburse for costs of education funding.''
</P>
<P>
   But one GOP political rival immediately seized on Wednesday's
statement by Bush, saying it raises questions about the GOP
front-runner's ability to handle tough policy questions.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mueller, communications director for rival GOP presidential
candidate Steve Forbes, said the Bush campaign actions suggest ``a
budding and ongoing pattern ... of an amazing inability to clarify
and reach understanding on where they stand on key and core issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the same kind of tactical pattern of fuzz they used
when we challenged their position on taxes a while back,'' said
Mueller. ``They need to stop acting like typical Washington
politicians and flip-flopping all over the Beltway.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in an interview last week with The Chronicle, was asked
if, as president, he would reimburse California for the estimated
billions of dollars the state spends annually on services and
education for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' replied the GOP front-runner. Asked for a reason, Bush
said, ``Because that's not a federal role, in my judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments were first published Friday and were not
disputed by his campaign at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But they drew sharp reaction from Forbes and some immigration
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if he would say that in reaction to an earthquake or
a hurricane or a severe drought,'' Forbes told The Chronicle.
``Certain things are beyond the control of state governments and
take a national response. Clearly, the borders are a national
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Stein, who heads the Washington-based Federation for
American Immigration Reform, said Bush's comments underscored that
the candidate has offered ``no immigration policy . . . he has no
border patrol plan. He has no interior enforcement strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign was contacted Tuesday for response to the
criticism. Spokeswoman Mindy Tucker initially declined, saying the
governor was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush supporters in California defended him, noting that the
issues of reimbursement are complex and involve not only education,
but incarceration and health care for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Bush campaign released a clarification, outlining
the governor's positions on reimbursement to states and illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought the question was about whether the federal
government should reimburse for costs of education funding,''
according to the statement. ``Governor Bush's answer reflects his
belief that education funding is primarily the responsibility of
state governments, and his knowledge that Washington already sends
money to states for disadvantaged children through the Title I
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``believes the most effective use of federal money to stop
illegal immigration is at the front end, to stop people from
illegally entering our country, not at the back end, by reimbursing
states after it has failed to enforce the border,'' the statement
said. And it noted that Bush, as governor of Texas, ``knows
firsthand the unusual costs that border states incur as a result of
the federal government's failure to enforce our border.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, Governor Bush would allocate additional
resources to enforcing the border, so states such as Texas and
California would not have the huge expenses they currently do.
Governor Bush understands the current federal reimbursement
programs may not be adequate and will work with Congress and those
states to improve them,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes, who promised Wednesday to fight hard for votes in
California and will begin a major campaign tour here this month,
said in a telephone interview that he welcomes a state discussion
of his own immigration, trade and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said for a long time that the feds ought to reimburse
states for those kinds of costs,'' said Forbes. ``We ought to
reform and reorganize the (Immigration and Naturalization Service).
We need policies that are quicker, simpler and more dependable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign is ``struggling to determine what their issues
are, rather than stating forthrightly what they believe,'' said
Mueller. ``They are too concerned what every little response will
do with their poll numbers ... and always worried about putting
(their) finger to the wind.''

SHOW MUST GO ON AT SYMPHONY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ It sounded good on paper: Open the San
Francisco Symphony season with husband-wife opera stars Angela
Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna headlining the big show.
<P>
   But the word was that Angela and Roberto, being opera
superstars, could be, you know, opera superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Symphony director Michael Tilson Thomas, insiders say, was more
than a little nervous going into the venture, but Michael Tilson
Thomas is, you know, Michael Tilson Thomas and he pulled it off.
The man rises to a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He kicked it all off, as usual, with the National Anthem, and
Angela and Roberto were tighter than Sonny and Cher in the good old
days.
</P>
<P>
   Now the challenge is over to the opera folks: Can you top this?
</P>
<P>
   BAYWATCH TRIVIA (although if you're a true fan of ``Baywatch,''
nothing about it is trivial):
</P>
<P>
   Who was the first babe on Baywatch, the L.A. County Lifeguard
boat that stars in the TV series of the same name?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Wendy Paskin, wife of former and maybe future mayor
Frank Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Paskin, a national-class swimmer in college, was the first
female L.A. County lifeguard, back in the '70s. ``Eight hundred men
and me,'' Wendy says.
</P>
<P>
   She was assigned to work the Baywatch boat, although there was
fear among higher-ups that if you had a mixed-gender crew, Baywatch
would become the Love Boat.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy designed the first L.A. Lifeguard bikini uniform, and her
solid work broke down the gender barrier and made Pamela Anderson
possible.
</P>
<P>
   HONEY, I shrunk.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Merton Hanks' explanation to his wife for why he
was traded by the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks was a 49ers' defensive star for the last six seasons, but
he suddenly got too small. Mert the Squirt.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Bill Walsh says the 49ers need a heftier free
safety to stop the big running backs.
</P>
<P>
   Merton was one of the solid guys, a man of character, played
with flair, was great with media and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Football's a biz, sure. But Lawrence Phillips in, Merton Hanks
out?
</P>
<P>
   CRISIS SOLVED: Traffic nightmares at the new Giants' ballpark?
Gone!
</P>
<P>
   On the cover of the new Pac Bell S.F. white pages is an artist's
rendering of the ballpark. Tiny people (Merton Hanks?) are
strolling to the game, and on the streets that run past the
ballpark, King and Third, where thousands of cars figure to become
stuck like peanuts in peanut brittle on game days _ five cars!
</P>
<P>
   As long as the artist was indulging in deep fantasy, couldn't he
or she have included a World Championship banner snapping in a
light breeze above the park?
</P>
<P>
   ST. FRANCIS himself would love it.
</P>
<P>
   At the Palace of the Legion of Honor, in the special exhibit of
art and artifacts from the quake-damaged St. Francis of Assisi
basilica in Italy, Lawrence Barbu noted this small scene last week:
</P>
<P>
   A patient red setter in a seeing-eye-dog harness is leading a
blind woman, who is pushing a man in a wheelchair. The man reads
aloud the informational plaques and vividly describes the art to
the young woman. All three seem to be greatly enjoying the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   YOU'VE PROBABLY read enough about Bill and Hillary Clinton's
fixer-upper.
</P>
<P>
   No, not their house. Their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the Clintons bought an old house in a New York hamlet
named Chappaqua, and Jerry Matters figures this is the perfect home
for the First Pothead, though Jerry didn't use that disrespectful
term.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry notes that the 1966 movie ``Chappaqua,'' a very minor
non-classic, is the fictional tale of Conrad Rooks and the
hallucinations he encounters while withdrawing from heroin and
booze.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is Freak City: William S. Burroughs as Opium Jones,
Allen Ginsberg as Messiah, Ravi Shankar as Sun God, and Moondog as
The Prophet.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is probably over Bill's head, since he didn't inhale.
But as Matters points out, nobody has asked Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   CAN YOU find all five grammatical errors in this sign posted in
at least two Redwood City post office branches (spotted by Howard
Frohlich)?:
</P>
<P>
   ``Get your Duck Stamp's before its to late.''
</P>
<P>
   WE MUST keep Apple's new desktop supercomputer from falling into
the hands of foreign bad guys. So says our government.
</P>
<P>
   The new Power Mac G4 can perform a gigaflop, which, I believe,
is something the computer's owner would have to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   If an evil government gets its hands on one of these babies, the
bad guys could use the technology to destroy the world, which would
be bad for Macintosh stock.
</P>
<P>
   So it's comforting that the G4 will soon be in the safe and
secure hands of millions of disaffected, isolated, alienated,
crazed, unemployed loner computer geeks.

   WASHINGTON _ Are you in love and ready to tie the knot? Do you
want the kind of wedding reception where the guests eat, drink and
dance until well past midnight? Would you like them to throw
confetti and blow party horns?
</P>
<P>
   If that's your idea of a memorable reception, join the other
brave soon-to-be brides and grooms who are brushing aside warnings
about computer bugs and possible blizzards to plan New Year's Eve
weddings. On one Web site dedicated to ``millennium couples''
(www.theknot.com/2000), brides-to-be are posting their reasons for
wanting to wed as 1999 melts into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured not too many people would turn down a chance to come
to a New Year's Eve party,'' said one Iowa woman who plans to give
her guests party hats and noisemakers.
</P>
<P>
   A woman from West Virginia said her fiance favored exchanging
wedding rings just after the year turns to 2000 so that ``he can
remember our anniversary and the number of years we've been
married.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who think it would be fun to have guests toast both a
marriage and a new era must be prepared for possible problems that
no other couples have ever faced. For one thing, prices may be
higher than on any other date _ ever.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Glidden, owner of Weddings to Perfection, a Northern
Virginia party-planning company, said that normally she organizes
at least two or three New Year's Eve weddings. But this year, not a
single couple has stepped forward for that date. ``It's weird,
because I expected a lot more people would want to do it,'' she
said. ``I thought it would be grand'' to have a millennium theme.
</P>
<P>
   Glidden blames high costs for the nuptial lull. Caterers,
musicians and bartenders ``want double- or triple-time money''
because of the high demand for their services on any New Year's
Eve, she said. On this particular Dec. 31, a larger-than-usual
number of parties could drive prices even higher. Brides and grooms
``may be biting off more than they will want to chew'' if they try
to make millennium magic, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But costs may not be the only reason to shy away from Dec. 31.
Many computer programmers believe a software date flaw, commonly
called the Y2K bug, could trigger an array of problems just as the
clock strikes midnight on Jan. 1. The disruptions could range from
imperceptible to ruinous for receptions. For example, there is a
chance the power might fail or computer-controlled door locks and
elevators could malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Y2K threat weren't enough to scare off couples, the
183-year-old Farmers' Almanac predicts a stormy December, capped by
a blizzard bringing more than a foot of snow to much of the country
during the last week of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, daring as they are, the brides and grooms who will defy
the potential problems of New Year's Eve may be topped by those who
plan to give birth around midnight. Last April 9, many couples
tried to conceive a baby, knowing that the date would give them the
best chance to produce 2000's first offspring.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of traffic jams from New Year's Eve celebrations
and fireworks displays, the chance of Y2K-related equipment
breakdowns at hospitals and the likelihood of snowstorms could not
discourage those who want to deliver a new generation into a new
age.
</P>
<P>
   Planning a wedding or a birth for the peak of the New Year
nuttiness may not be prudent. But if all goes well, the optimistic
couples and their loved ones will never forget their
once-in-a-millennium midnight moment.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: IS BIG BROTHER LOOSE ON THE WEB?
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Sept. 12.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So far as I know, I've never met Candido Torres,
although we seem to share the same Social Security number. This
news came to light by dint of a $39.95 investment in USsearch.com,
which bills itself on the Internet as ``the worldwide leader in
public record information.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing my duty as a reporter, I snooped on myself. But USSearch
promises to deliver the goods on any name you supply _ accessing
the same ``public record databases used by the FBI, law enforcement
agencies and private investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal Privacy Act of 1974 casts doubt on whether Social
Security numbers are a matter of public record. However, the number
is being used so widely for identification, both inside and outside
the government, that invasion of privacy concerns appear moot.
</P>
<P>
   Yale University, for example, uses Social Security numbers for
student IDs. Several states and the District of Columbia also use
it for their drivers' licenses, while others cull the number from
application forms.
</P>
<P>
   A company named Image Data LLC has signed a $1.5 million
contract with the U.S. Secret Service to create a national identity
database by digitizing existing drivers' licenses and other
personal data, beginning with a pilot project in three states.
</P>
<P>
   The company's boss, Robert Houvener, ridicules the idea that
there are legitimate privacy issues at stake. Noting that he has
personally been a victim of ``identity fraud,'' Houvener says the
nationwide photo file will be targeted at the ``identity
criminals'' who he estimates suck billions of dollars a year out of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates fear turning Big Brother loose. Says Marc
Rotenberg, director of Electronic Privacy Information Center:
``This is not a database that people can easily opt out of. You
have to give up your photograph when you get a driver's license.''
</P>
<P>
   A Web site dubbed drivingrecords.com offers to obtain the goods
on anybody you care to snoop on _ anywhere but California. For $30,
you're promised many items, including the lowdown on ``DUI's,
moving violations, tickets, accidents and wreckless (sic)
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   The slippery slope began to slip in 1943 when President Franklin
Roosevelt, worried about Nazi spies, told federal agencies to use
Social Security numbers in their record-keeping systems. Since
1961, the Internal Revenue Service has been using it as a taxpayer
ID number.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Internet, which is good at searching records, has
dropped the privacy bar further. The same snoops who told me about
my apparent dual use with Candido Torres also told me that they had
searched, among others, data banks that held my military records
and various drug enforcement and firearms lists.
</P>
<P>
   As privacy barriers plummet, what should you do if you find that
somebody is using your Social Security number?
</P>
<P>
   The feds suggest that every few years you get a copy of your
file from the Social Security Administration, thereby ensuring that
contributions are being correctly recorded. The needed form can be
printed from the agency Web site or ordered by calling (800)
772-1213.
</P>
<P>
   I'm checking up. Perhaps Candido Torres will too.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: This plane ride was touch-and-go
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Friends have asked me if I have a fear of flying.
</P>
<P>
   I have a fear of flying coach, I always tell them, but that's
the extent of it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, I've traveled to any number of spots in the world on
flights that stretched out more than a dozen hours _ to Hong Kong,
Tokyo, New Zealand, South Africa _ and slept like a baby most of
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   I've flown on any number of foreign airlines _ Russia's
Aeroflop, Mexico's Spanish Fly, the Dark Continent's Nocturnal
Airlines (''We Fly By Night'') _ and enjoyed them all.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that I have no fear of flying? For good reason.
Nothing bad ever happened to me before.
</P>
<P>
   Before my flight to Washington, D.C., this week.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was on its final approach. Tray tables and seat backs
were in their upright and locked positions. We were even arriving a
few minutes early.
</P>
<P>
   And we almost made it on the first try, but not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds before the wheels were to touch down, our landing
suddenly turned into a takeoff, engines roaring at full throttle
and flaps flapping for all they were worth.
</P>
<P>
   Not a word was spoken, not by a passenger, not by the pilot.
Save your breath, it's a steep climb.
</P>
<P>
   After a while _ an eon or two _ the plane leveled off, banked
into a turn, headed back in the direction from which we came _ and
the pilot finally came on the intercom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry about that, folks,'' he intoned, his voice as steady as
the rock that had formed in my stomach. ``There was a plane
crossing our runway, and the tower instructed us to make another
round.''
</P>
<P>
   I think I could speak for most of my fellow passengers when I
say that any number of us could have used another round or two.
</P>
<P>
   A hit-or-miss situation: One plane landing, and another plane
taking off. Somebody didn't notice the yield sign. Next thing you
know you no longer need an airline. You're flying with the angels.
</P>
<P>
   There's much in the news these days about flight delays, lots of
complaints from the public. Not from me. If I have anything to do
with it, my next flight is going to be delayed as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Too many flights, too many ups and downs; too many planes, too
many balls in the air. If you're in such a hurry, you can have my
seat.
</P>
<P>
   After the aborted landing into Washington, we came down just
fine the second time around. It only seemed like a wing and prayer
_ the pilot winging it while the rest of us supplied the prayers.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect landing, I'd say. At this point, any landing I could
walk away from with my carry-on was perfectly fine with me.
</P>
<P>
   The captain, smiling an apologetic smile, was at the doorway as
we left the plane. I gave him a thumbs up. ``Nicely done,'' I said.
For a moment he looked as if he might hug me. For a fact, I could
have used a hug.
</P>
<P>
   But I guess I'll keep on flying. For one thing, I have to make
the return trip from Washington. For another, I have all those
frequent flier miles I've accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. No doubt I'll still manage to sleep like a baby _ even
more so, now that I wake up screaming.
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Russians and Muslims don't seem to mix
 &HT;    (For release Sept. 12, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the more malevolent days of U.S.-Arab relations, the
Americans usually wound up being excoriated by Arab states for
siding against the Muslim people. Indeed, support of terrorism had
a lot to do with it, but the Arabs see it another way, contending
the U.S. had no passion for any Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. warplanes have pounded Libya and Iraq, have railed against
Moammar Ghadafi and Saddam Hussein, have sent out a Most Wanted
bulletin on millionaire Islamic terrorist Osama bin Laden, have
tried and convicted Islamic terrorists in the U.S., have stood
beside the supreme Arab rival, Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The late Jordanian King Hussein, if you recall, first took sides
with Saddam Hussein during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. He
alleged that the allied attack on Iraq was against ``all Arabs and
all Muslims and not against Iraq alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone of his message was not lost on Washington, which feared
a greater anti-U.S. reaction from Islamic states. Perhaps that's
why George Bush did not allow Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf's forces to
proceed on to Baghdad, why Saddam Hussein was left to continue to
lord over the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, however, the king _ as he was so capable of doing _
deftly maneuvered himself back to the middle ground, calling for
peace but not for anyone's victory. The U.S. breathed a sigh of
relief at his relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the years of turmoil in U.S.-Arab relations, which
also included a punishing Arab oil embargo in 1973, the Soviet
Union and, now, the Russians have basked in the comfort of warm
relations with Arab states, particularly the most radical.
</P>
<P>
   While American flags were being burned in Islamic cities, the
Soviet and Russian flags have been held high. Which is a
puzzlement.
</P>
<P>
   When Afghanistan's Soviet-placed communist government faltered
before Islamic ideals in 1979, the Soviets invaded. They got their
noses bloodied by the opposition forces but spent a decade in
Afghanistan before removing their last troops in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Chechnya, a breakaway Russian state, principally
Muslim. Russian soldiers and bombs poured into the territory.
Again, it was Russia against Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yugoslavian ethnic cleansing situation came to a head
and U.S.-led NATO bombed Yugoslavia and the Serbs, it was another
case of the Russians opposing a Muslim people, the Kosovars, and
siding with Serbs, who were Christians _ considered to be cousins
of the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Russians are in combat with still more Muslims as they
bog down, and embarrass themselves militarily, in Dagestan in
southern Russia, unable to eradicate Islamic rebels who wish to
create an Islamic state there.
</P>
<P>
   None less than Boris Yeltsin has exhibited great frustration at
the Dagestan operation, last week berating his army for ``military
sloppiness.'' The death toll for Russian troops has surpassed 100

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Russians and Muslims don't seem to mix
 &HT;    (Eds: Fixes garble.)
 &HT;    (For release Sept. 12, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the more malevolent days of U.S.-Arab relations, the
Americans usually wound up being excoriated by Arab states for
siding against the Muslim people. Indeed, support of terrorism had
a lot to do with it, but the Arabs see it another way, contending
the U.S. had no passion for any Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. warplanes have pounded Libya and Iraq, have railed against
Moammar Ghadafi and Saddam Hussein, have sent out a Most Wanted
bulletin on millionaire Islamic terrorist Osama bin Laden, have
tried and convicted Islamic terrorists in the U.S., have stood
beside the supreme Arab rival, Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The late Jordanian King Hussein, if you recall, first took sides
with Saddam Hussein during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. He
alleged that the allied attack on Iraq was against ``all Arabs and
all Muslims and not against Iraq alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone of his message was not lost on Washington, which feared
a greater anti-U.S. reaction from Islamic states. Perhaps that's
why George Bush did not allow Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf's forces to
proceed on to Baghdad, why Saddam Hussein was left to continue to
lord over the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, however, the king _ as he was so capable of doing _
deftly maneuvered himself back to the middle ground, calling for
peace but not for anyone's victory. The U.S. breathed a sigh of
relief at his relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the years of turmoil in U.S.-Arab relations, which
also included a punishing Arab oil embargo in 1973, the Soviet
Union and, now, the Russians have basked in the comfort of warm
relations with Arab states, particularly the most radical.
</P>
<P>
   While American flags were being burned in Islamic cities, the
Soviet and Russian flags have been held high. Which is a
puzzlement.
</P>
<P>
   When Afghanistan's Soviet-placed communist government faltered
before Islamic ideals in 1979, the Soviets invaded. They got their
noses bloodied by the opposition forces but spent a decade in
Afghanistan before removing their last troops in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Chechnya, a breakaway Russian state, principally
Muslim. Russian soldiers and bombs poured into the territory.
Again, it was Russia against Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yugoslavian ethnic cleansing situation came to a head
and U.S.-led NATO bombed Yugoslavia and the Serbs, it was another
case of the Russians opposing a Muslim people, the Kosovars, and
siding with Serbs, who were Christians _ considered to be cousins
of the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Russians are in combat with still more Muslims as they
bog down, and embarrass themselves militarily, in Dagestan in
southern Russia, unable to eradicate Islamic rebels who wish to
create an Islamic state there.
</P>
<P>
   None less than Boris Yeltsin has exhibited great frustration at
the Dagestan operation, last week berating his army for ``military
sloppiness.'' The death toll for Russian troops has surpassed 100
in the one month of fighting, and guess who enters the picture?
None other than the terrorist Osama bin Laden, who, according to
Russia's interior minister, is behind the militant activity in
Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   When you add one and one, the answers comes out that the
Russians are more personally involved in battling Islam than the
Americans. One has to wonder how those Islamic states feel about
their former sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   If the Arab League can threaten a fatuous vote to boycott Burger
King in all their territories because a BK has been built in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank, why does it not also see that Islamic
influence and ambition is under fire from Russian troops?
</P>
<P>
   Russian influence has done nothing to buttress the continued
isolation of Iraq; it has seen its Afghan puppet state lost to
fanatical Taliban Muslims, it has suffered rebellion from two of
its own semi-autonomous, Muslim-dominated regions.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. was anti-Muslim in its military response to Saddam
Hussein's invasion of Muslim Kuwait _ as Jordan's Hussein first
hypocritically proclaimed _ then what is to be said about the
Russians, whose only military clashes in the past two decades have
been against Muslims?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Waco's shades of gray
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Count me Waco wishy-washy.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI should have been straight up about its use of
potentially incendiary devices from the get-go, but unless there's
more to this matter than we know so far, the flap appears to be
much ado about very little.
</P>
<P>
   Grand oratorios of indignation are being sung over the belated
discovery that, contrary to earlier impressions, the FBI did, too,
use incendiary devices in the raid that killed 80 or so Branch
Davidians near Waco, Texas, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, once we're past the gee-whiz nature of the
first reporting, the two flammable canisters were fired some 50 to
100 yards away from, and hours before, the fire that destroyed the
cult's compound.
</P>
<P>
   And what is more, their use has been on the public record since
1995. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   It's that ``sort of'' where this matter went haywire.
</P>
<P>
   In its report to Congress, the FBI acknowledged that ``military
rounds'' had been fired, but neither Congress nor journalists
pursued that enigmatic reference. If anyone had, it would have
become clear that the term implied potentially incendiary devices.
(Though in fact, they are likely to start fires only in tinder-box
situations. The ones used in Waco were fired at concrete bunkers
and apparently sputtered out harmlessly.)
</P>
<P>
   The current problem comes from the FBI's failure to make that
implication clear on its own _ hanging Attorney General Janet Reno
out to dry all these years while she defended her Justice
Department and the bureau itself against charges such devices had
been used.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as though the FBI, to avoid the embarrassment of
clarifying the record, decided to play chicken with the odds that
it would be found out _ and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, everybody with an ax to grind is sharpening
their blade on the discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are calling for Reno to quit, although she's pretty
clearly the snookered party, not the snookee. The real GOP beef
with Reno remains that she hasn't arrested the hated Bill Clinton
for something or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiratorialists, who have always seen Waco as evidence of an
evil government plot, are in an I-told-you-so swoon.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, however, still indicates the cultists themselves
chose Gotterdammerung over disillusioning capitulation. And the
conspiracy buffs still have no answer to the question of just what
the government possibly could have thought it would gain by
slaughtering scores of pitiable naifs in the thrall of a religious
nut case.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths at Waco, especially those of the children, were a
hideous tragedy, and the FBI had an obligation to be plain about
every detail. It was not. It deserves rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   In the circumstances _ four officers shot dead and 16 wounded
trying to serve arrest warrants; a 51-day siege with no one sane to
negotiate with _ a raid to end the impasse was the right thing to
do. In its horrid outcome, it was the wrong thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   You know, here in the real world, sometimes things are just a
mess and that's all there is to it.

LOVE WILL PLAY IN RYDER, AGENT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- There'll be no Love lost for the United States Ryder
Cup team at The Country Club in two weeks. At least that's what the
agent for one of the world's top players says.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to reports that Davis Love III has been told to rest
a pinched nerve in his back, Vernon Spratley said: ``He's been
resting and undergoing therapy, but he'll be fine for the Ryder
Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Spratley said Love, 35, had first been bothered at the Sprint
International (Aug. 19-22). The next week he went to the NEC
Invitational, and while he played well enough (68-69-70-72_279) to
finish tied for 10th, the pain was still there.
</P>
<P>
   On the driving range early Saturday evening following his third
round, Love cut short his practice to go to the fitness trailer and
work out with a personal trainer. His shoulder was hurting, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, minutes after he completed his tournament, Love
told a Boston Globe reporter that he had decided against going to
The Country Club the next day (Aug. 30); instead, he was going to
see a specialist back in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swung really hard, and my whole arm really started
tingling,'' said Love. ``I think I've got something in my neck. I
need rest. I need three weeks in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly looks like he'll get it. Following doctors' orders
to stay away from golf, Love did not play in Vancouver last week,
nor will he be in the Canadian Open this week. He'll skip the B.C.
Open (Sept. 16-19), too.
</P>
<P>
   Spratley said, however, that Love would be ready for the Sept.
24-26 competition in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   Love, ranked fourth in the world, lends valuable Ryder Cup
experience that US captain Ben Crenshaw covets. He played in
1993-95-97, and with a 5-8-1 record, Love has played more Ryder Cup
matches than anyone on the US team except for Payne Stewart (16
matches).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Love is considered a quiet team leader who is
passionate about the Ryder Cup. He is arguably one of the most
respected players on the PGA Tour and a player _ given the turmoil
at the PGA Championship when Crenshaw implicated four players
(Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara, David Duval, Phil Mickelson) for their
poor attitude toward the competition _ that the captain desperately
wants on the team.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Love has been bothered by aches and
pains. One week after finishing second to Jose Maria Olazabal at
the Masters, Love withdrew from the MCI Classic. He cited a sore
back, and one suspects it had to be really bothering him because
he's won the event at Harbour Town four times.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Love missed more than a month of the season with a
sore back.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has not won this year, Love has quietly put up another
superb season. In 18 events (not counting the World Match Play),
Love has recorded three seconds and 11 top 10s and earned
$1,771,728 to rank sixth. He has missed just two cuts.
</P>
<P>
   If Love were to be unable to play in the Ryder Cup, his spot
would automatically go to Bob Estes, who was 11th in the standings.

 &HT;    GORE'S PRACTICAL CHANGE: MORE RELAXED AND AT EASE ON THE STUMP
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 12
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore was earnestly plowing
through a major speech on health care in a small crowded hospital
conference room here last week when a baby began to cry. As the
infant's parents rose to leave, Gore briefly abandoned his speech
to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about that,'' Gore assured the embarrassed
parents. ``This is a working family event.'' And the child's cries
- ``That's music,'' he declared with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone relaxed, including Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The moment was fleeting, but it underscored how much more at
ease the vice president seems now than in the earlier more ragged
days of his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just see a guy who's becoming more relaxed in his own
skin,'' said Rob Reiner, the actor and movie producer who promotes
child welfare issues and informally advises Gore on health care
matters. ``He's much more casual now than he has been.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what political fixer Tony Coelho wants now that he is
managing the Gore campaign - a more relaxed candidate in cozier
settings with fewer people and a more narrowly honed message of
``practical change'' to help working families cope with the
challenges of modern life in America.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent weeks, with the retooled Gore campaign moving
through Iowa, California and New Hampshire, that is what he has
gotten: Gore, dressed in a golf shirt, khakis and cowboy boots
nearly as often as in a suit, starched white shirt and tie, meeting
with small groups of voters or party activists, exchanging ideas
rather than standing behind a lectern delivering weighty speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Al Gore a lot better when he gets off the speech,''
said Eric Bauman, a special assistant to California Gov. Gray
Davis, one of the uncommitted pols being wooed by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hasn't abandoned the lectern altogether, however. He used
it even in the small conference room at Children's Hospital in Los
Angeles last Tuesday. He was delivering what aides had billed as a
``major policy address'' and the lectern, with the vice
presidential seal affixed, was an important prop to add to the
officious nature of the event.
</P>
<P>
   And the following day, Gore stood ramrod straight behind the
podium at the Anaheim Convention Center to address the national
convention of the American Legion - a posture clearly expected of
anyone appearing before the nation's premier military veterans
organization.
</P>
<P>
   But even there, Gore departed from his prepared text to tell a
moving story about the recent death of his uncle, Everett ``Punk''
LaFon, a veteran of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands how veterans feel,'' said Korean War veteran
Jim Heath of Denton, Texas, after hearing the story. ``I like him a
whole lot better than I like his boss man,'' added the lifelong
Republican, contrasting his feeling for Gore and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore clearly has abandoned the ``imperial'' campaign many
worried Democratic activists perceived in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   During a Labor Day swing through Iowa, for example, Gore
casually strolled in a parade. And at week's end, he was in New
Hampshire for coffee and counsel in the homes of Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in late August, Gore went on a busy two-day,
eight-town swing through north central Iowa. And on each leg of the
trip, dozens of uncommitted local party activists boarded Gore's
bus for up-close-and-personal time with the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Cook, the influential political newsletter publisher,
accompanied Gore on the Iowa bus trip and concluded: ``Watching
Vice President Gore on the stump, and seeing his campaign operation
in action, makes you wonder about the conventional wisdom in
Washington that he's an ineffectual candidate with a disorganized
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of buzz Coelho wants as the Gore campaign heads
into the fall - an end to press accounts describing the campaign as
struggling for traction, rife with backstage intrigue, overshadowed
by Republican frontrunner George W. Bush and unable to shake free
of Bill Bradley, the sole challenger in the Democratic contest.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the changes in style, Gore faces a major challenge
in convincing voters that he the right man for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Washington Post-ABC News poll suggests how major a
challenge it is. The poll showed that even with the economy as
strong as ever, with peace abroad and with crime declining,
Americans have an appetite for political change - a daunting
prospect for a vice president who initially saw his political
prospects tied to continuing economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll was not altogether a surprise to the Gore campaign.
Their own polling and focus groups over the summer revealed the
same desire for political change. Consequently, Gore's speeches are
beginning to include new language about change.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, he spoke about the need for ``visionary
but practical change'' in public policies - ``change that can be
enacted into law, change that works for working families ... the
kind of change that I've fought for all my public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the new style and the new language, those who have
battled Gore before see no evidence of panic in the vice
president's White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his calculation is you run steady, long and strong,
and don't peak too early,'' said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who
opposed Gore in the 1988 presidential primaries. ``He's smart and
well prepared.''

 &HT;    Remember air raid drills?

<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ EDITOR'S NOTE: Remember when life seemed
simpler? Before faxes and e-mail and CDs and VCRs we travelled at a
slower pace. Here's some readers recollections of the way we were
...
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Vaughn B. Diggs, of Butler, Penn., remembers:
</P>
<P>
   When we drank sassafras tea and cut dandelions from the yard and
ate them in salads and made dandelion wine and jelly.
</P>
<P>
   When homemakers used curtain stretchers, wash boards and wringer
washers and boiled dirty clothes in copper pots.
</P>
<P>
   When a new car in 1946 cost $1,200 to $1,400.
</P>
<P>
   Marie C. Avery, of Lufkin, Texas, who writes she is 82 years
young, remembers:
</P>
<P>
   When people said ``please'' and ``thank you'' and ``sir'' and
``ma'am'' more often.
</P>
<P>
   When the mailman walked his route with a big, leather sack
strapped to his back.
</P>
<P>
   In May on Memorial Day (we called it Decoration Day then)

 &HT;    It's back to the woodshed as summer fades
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I've ended my summer hiatus from the
woodshop even though summer is definitely not finished with us here
behind the Pine Curtain. The urge to build and to make a mess with
shavings, sawdust and such outweighs the miserable conditions.
</P>
<P>
   I have worked out a schedule: start about 6:30 a.m. on the
weekends and work until just after lunch, when the sun drops down
in the west so that it hits directly into my un-air-conditioned
shop, and only mad dogs and Englishmen would continue. Go play golf
until dark, golf being a game that it's never too hot to play,
especially if you ride a cart and partake of cold libations. Come
back to the shop at dark and work until it's time to watch the 10
o'clock news.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, I don't start until nearly dusk, when the sun
has finally sunk behind the trees, and the temperature has
moderated to a delightful 95 degrees. I work outside as much as I
can, so as to catch what little breeze is out there, lighting the
driveway with a quartz halogen lamp, listening to NPR in between
screeches of woodworking machinery. My neighbors are likely making
up a petition as we speak to get me kicked out of Country Club
Estates.
</P>
<P>
   The planer makes the most noise. It's used to create a smooth
surface out of rough-cut wood and to ensure that all pieces are of
equal thickness. A planer sounds like a cross between a jet fighter
and a screaming banshee. It sends piles of wood chips hurling
about. I set the planer up near my pile of mulch, the ultimate in
recycling. After a few good rains, assuming it ever does rain again
for more than 30 seconds, the scraps will be ripe for putting on
the flower gardens.
</P>
<P>
   I draw a few stares as the occasional vehicle passes by on our
dead-end road, me dressed in ragged shorts and a tank top, feeding
14-foot pieces of black walnut in the dark through a machine that
could wake the dead, lit eerily by the quartz halogen lights. This
is messy work, planing wood. But satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   I have a trailer load of black walnut I'm surfacing now that
came out of a local sawmill several years ago. I bought it along
with a lathe, turning tools and other items from an old man who
spent years working at mills, fixing saws. We spent a pleasant
Sunday afternoon the other day, dickering and then finally loading
all this stuff on a trailer, him telling stories and me listening.
I couldn't wait to get home and plane a piece of this wood, covered
with dust and dirt, to find the treasure beneath.
</P>
<P>
   Black walnut is like gold to a woodworker, and though I'm not
good enough to take that title just yet, I appreciate what I've
bought. It has a light purple patina, a close grain and just feels
wonderful. I planed a piece and spent some time just pondering it,
lightly rubbing my fingers across its surface, holding it up to the
light to admire it.
</P>
<P>
   There's another load of red oak stacked in the shop, courtesy of
a friend who scored it out of a Louisiana sawmill. I've begun
building a coffee table for my daughters out of that stock,
learning to use a biscuit joiner to create the table top _ an
ingenious little tool that cuts grooves into the edges of the wood
and then uses small balsa biscuits that swell when covered with
glue, so that the end result is a wide chunk of wood that looks
like single piece. I figure my kids are good to experiment on,
being college students whose idea of fine furniture is anything
they can cadge for free out of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Next task is learning how to turn wood on the lathe. That's how
you make fancy table legs, bowls and other exotic items. I have
borrowed books, scoured Internet sites and read every article I
could find in my woodworking magazines. Now it's time to learn by
doing, a scary prospect that likely will involve a large number of
failed attempts. I am a slow learner, this type of activity not
coming naturally to someone who is genetically uncoordinated.
</P>
<P>
   The only virtue I have is patience, something that has been hard
learned. I credit golf and advancing years for teaching me that it
takes time to learn what's valuable in life, to develop skills and
talents. There are danged few things that matter that come easily.
</P>
<P>
   At least I've got the time. And the wood. All that's needed now
for everything to be perfect is a cold front.

 &HT;    On winning, losing and how you play the game
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you really want to know people, study their
humor. What people find funny says a lot about them. People also
reveal their true selves in the way they play games.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the lore surrounding Harry Truman is that he used his
poker game as a way to audition Cabinet prospects. Truman was an
avid poker player and watched closely the way potential appointees
handled pressures of the game and how they won and lost. It was a
quick study in character.
</P>
<P>
   After I read that about Truman way back when, I started watching
how players react to the twists and turns of an evening of poker.
Not only did the Truman trick hone my observation skills, it
improved my game _ and the quality of my life. I don't put up with
either poor losers or poor winners at my poker table. I get enough
of both at work.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I'm re-learning golf, I find that the Truman principle
applies to pasture pool as well as poker. I tried golf back when I
worked nights years ago but never was very good at it. I was in too
big a hurry. I'm trying to get back into it with help of some of my
co-workers who are kind enough not to laugh too hard as I excavate
the course.
</P>
<P>
   What my poker buddies and the golf companions have in common is
that they are atheists when it comes to cutting you some slack.
</P>
<P>
   They don't believe in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they let you do mulligans?'' a colleague asked. As every
duffer knows, a mulligan is a second chance. Hooked (or sliced)
that ball off the tee? Go ahead, bud, take a mulligan. Try it
again. They don't do that at the Masters, but it's done on the
links where mortals hack around if everyone agrees.
</P>
<P>
   I answered with a snort. No way with this crowd. You play what
you hit the first time. As usual, I learned that I'm not traveling
in the right circles.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton plays golf, and if you believe what you read in The
New York Times, he isn't that much better at it than I am. As
reported last week by the Times' Don Van Natta Jr., the president
claims scores in the 80s. I hit in the 80s too _ but then I have
six more holes to play. Van Natta also reported that the
presidential score is augmented by more than his share of
mulligans. Even worse, Clinton doesn't ask permission from his golf
buddies before taking his mulligans.
</P>
<P>
   Van Natta used the president's liberal use of mulligans as a
metaphor for his tenure as president. Clinton got mulligan after
mulligan as he rolled from water hazard to sand trap and into the
woods of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Golf is a tough game. It punishes impatience. It demands
discipline and focus. In short, golf is a lot like poker. Both are
a lot like life. Unless you were born with a big stack of chips in
front of you, you have to pay attention and focus on certain
fundamentals to maximize life's rewards. Don't and it costs you.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaters may rake in a few pots or win the round with the pencil
wedge, but sooner or later they're discovered for what they are and
have to find another game. It should be no big surprise that the
president would bend the truth about his golf game. Mulligans have
pretty much defined his life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as I read the Times article, I couldn't help but wonder how
Clinton would fare sitting at a poker table with Harry Truman. Do
you think he'd get the job?
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day has gone, but with it arrived the political season.
So, I have a suggestion. Before we pick our next president, maybe
we could interest the candidates in a nationally televised poker
game or maybe a golf tournament. That would tell us more about them
than those silly debates and the reams of speeches we're going to
be exposed to between now and the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, I'll even deal.

 &HT;    Dating Mr. Wrong
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Once upon a time, intuition did the
trick when hunting for happily ever after. Gals just knew if a guy
was Mr. Right. Or so they say.
</P>
<P>
   But for many women, romance, roses and truffle-bearing Romeos
can drown out that wee inner voice telling you something isn't
right. And while Grandma's advice is swell, this is, after all, the
'90s. Time to consult ... a police psychologist!
</P>
<P>
   The same profiling techniques cops use to spot potential thugs
can be applied to the fellow who just asked you out, say the
authors of ``Red Flags! How to Know When You're Dating a Loser''
(Plume, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   Gary Aumiller, 42, and Daniel Goldfarb, 40, are New York-based
therapists who specialize in law enforcement. In their book, just
out last Friday, the pair lists 25 types of guys to dodge.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: The Liar, The Leech, The Criticizer, The Rescuer,
The Loner and Mr. Ego. At the end of each chapter is a score card
to tally telltale signs, plus tips on how to dump the cad if he
racks up too many loser points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't mean the term `losers' to be derogatory,'' Aumiller
says. ``What we mean is `not relationship ready.' Or rather, a
`relationship criminal,' someone who steals from you emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, we've heard our male patients talk about the
things they've gotten away with with women. They couldn't believe
women fell for it again. Intuition can get short-circuited when
you're head over heels.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, could your new amor be a Possessor (Chapter 16)?
Red flags include a competitive home environment between siblings,
a short fuse at work, even the need to control seating arrangements
at a dinner party so you're always next to women.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, according to the book, is this: Bad upbringing
+ current life problems + bad experiences in dating + bad attitude
 &QC;  loser potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should learn what to look for in the first three dates
while your ego is still intact and your judgment is clear,''
Aumiller says.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember to pack a pencil and calculator in your evening
bag.

 &HT;    Dinner, movie _ now what?
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Here are five tips for dating success
from the authors of ``Red Flags! How to Know When You're Dating a
Loser'':
</P>
<P>
   1. Remember that most men are losers (in other words, not
relationship ready) at some point _ Think about the high school
jerk who matured into the man to land at the 10-year reunion.
Timing is key.
</P>
<P>
   2. Don't get attached too early _ Getting locked in too fast
means you're trying to make something work rather than evaluating
if it can work.
</P>
<P>
   3. Don't look for potential _ ``Potential'' is wonderful when
house shopping but not applicable when looking for a man. Date the
guy in front of you. (If you dig him but he needs work, let him
make changes before you go out.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Assess yourself first _ Do you want the bliss of being
attached without the sacrifice of accepting another's faults? Are
you a tad too needy?
</P>
<P>
   5. Move on quickly _ Why stick with a loser when there are, like
Mom said, loads of fish? The more you date, the better your odds
for finding a match.

 &HT;    I've taught the boys juggling, but there's more to life
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Specialization is a modern curse: people focused
on their own rabbit holes of expertise, too few of us acquiring a
true feel for the general lay of the land.
</P>
<P>
   I offer myself as a generalist, and comport myself that way at
work. Truth is, I'm a specialist like the next man. I can do a few
things really well. A lot of things I cannot do, like fly kites.
When I need a kite flown, I call a professional.
</P>
<P>
   I have, however, been attentive to teaching my sons some of
life's most important skills.
</P>
<P>
   Juggling, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone should know how to juggle. Juggling is an exercise in
extrasensory command, sort of like the Force that confirms a Jedi.
</P>
<P>
   Juggling would be a cinch if we had three eyes. If you have
three eyes, you'll have to do something else to impress us. For the
rest of us, juggling is impressive. It means one has learned to
feel the balls as they land in one's hands, to throw them
consistently to a spot in front of one's unwavering eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In my master's chair in recent months I have confirmed upon my
two sons the exalted title of juggler. This after much trial and
comedic error.
</P>
<P>
   Juggling is something done only for an audience, and so it must
be when learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch me ... oops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, watch, watch ... rats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK. Hold it. Now, watch. Whoops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold it. OK. Now here I go. Oops.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust the dadgummed Force, Luke.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed amid these trials is the rattle of a glass coffee
table getting hit by an errant tennis ball, a cat fleeing for
safety, a mother groaning.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't understand. Then again, she doesn't juggle.
</P>
<P>
   Juggling brings joy, confidence and stage sense. It also brings
an audience _ guaranteed _ if for no other reason than the audience
wants to make sure none of the balls land in the cherry cobbler.
</P>
<P>
   As proud as I am to have passed on this skill to my boys, I
realize how miserable their childhood remains without other
important life skills commonly passed down from father to son.
</P>
<P>
   Like spitting.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I read with envy coverage in the Los Angeles Times
of the 19th annual Spitoono, ``a celebration of long-distance
tobacco spitting'' in Clemson, S.C., on the ball field behind the
National Guard Armory.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Times discuss the event's competitive essence,
it also ran down the history of spit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allure of saliva extends across the ages,'' it said. ``In
the ancient world, spit was seen as a mystical salve, powerful and
sacred.'' It related the Biblical story about Jesus moistening a
blind man's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   That's inspiring, sure. But consider this: The Spitoono
champion, a brawny woodsman and connoisseur of Red Man chaw, hurled
his winning missile 20 feet, 1 1/2 inches.
</P>
<P>
   I'll never measure up to that.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, one more way in which my boys are deprived of a manly
art. Should either of them come demanding instruction one of these
days, I'll have to hand him the phone and tell him to call Loogie
Master or any of the other franchise service providers in the
Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   There are other things I want to be able to teach my sons but
can't. I can't do the wolf whistle. I can't do the Tarzan call. I
can't pick up anything with my toes.
</P>
<P>
   I know I am letting my children down in not being able to impart
any of these things, these manly skills for living.
</P>
<P>
   So they'll just have to survive, knowing that if all else fails,
as barbarians beat at the gates, at least through my wise counsel
they'll be able to baffle the horde into disarray by getting their
hands on three balls.

 &HT;    Myy-y-y kind of cows
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When Heidi Kooi left West Palm Beach five years ago
for Chicago, she had no idea she'd ride herd on a true tourist
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm kinda consumed by cows,'' Kooi says.
</P>
<P>
   In a city famous for its Bulls, Bears and Cubs, cows now
dominate sidewalks, parks, roofs, walls and girders. The Cows On
Parade are fiberglass cows decorated by Chicago artists.
</P>
<P>
   On the State Street Bridge is a lifesize cow wearing a hardhat,
City of Chicago reflective red vest and yellow boots. Then you see
Chi-cow-go. Marilyn Monroe cow. Cows covered with gumdrops, lake
pebbles, stamps, tattoos. A cow with race-car flames. A stockmarket
cow dressed for ``work,'' briefcase in mouth. A shopping cow, boxes
on its back. A piano-playing cow. A Harry Caray, Holy Cow! cow.
</P>
<P>
   Silly and fun. You have to see more. How many? Three hundred!
You've got to see them all. You now have the Mad Cow Disease that
has an udder grip on Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Cow maps have become a collector's item. There are Chicago cow
Web sites. A book is in the works. Tourists scrap long-standing
sightseeing plans to follow the herd, cow to cow. The cows are so
beloved, there have been only two minor acts of vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity has reached saturation, soaking Kooi, 27, Lake Worth
Christian High School Class of '90, who is now media relations
manager for the Chicago Office of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what this exhibit has done.''
</P>
<P>
   She recently returned from escorting celeb cows to the Illinois
State Fair. Later that week she was rushing out to lead Oprah's TV
crew on a cow tour.
</P>
<P>
   All this started after Peter Hanig returned to Chicago last
summer from a trip to Switzerland. The Michigan Avenue shoe store
owner saw decorated cows on the streets of Zurich that created a
tourist buzz.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched the idea to Chicago's Cultural Affairs Office. The
cows hit the streets in June and continue grazing for gazers until
Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   When Kooi first heard the idea, she winced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little bit skeptical,'' Kooi says. ``Yet, the minute
I saw the lifesize cow, the unpainted version, I knew that it was
going to be something unique, fun and whimsical.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wasn't sure how the public would react and that's what
we're most surprised about.''
</P>
<P>
   After Chicago ordered the fiberglass female cows from a Swiss
factory, artists were solicited to decorate them. Each artist got
$1,000 from the $3,500 per cow paid by corporate sponsors. Cows
decorated by a handful of big-name artists such as painter Ed
Paschke, architect Helmut Jahn and fashion photographer/artist
Victor Skrebneski cost sponsors $11,000.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsorships lagged until the first crazy-looking cows hit
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Chicago's cows will be auctioned for charity Nov. 9 at
the Chicago Theater. The buyer picks the charity. At Zurich's cow
auction, the bovines brought $5,000 to $25,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Kooi has heard an Iowa city is planning a Pigs on Parade and
next summer New York City may duplicate Chicago's Cow Parade.
</P>
<P>
   And Kooi isn't forgetting the folks back home in Palm Beach
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could do something along the beaches,'' she says.
``Fiberglass palm trees. Have them sponsored. It doesn't have to be
on the large scale that we did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about this exhibit is that it got people
talking about art,'' Kooi says. ``And that's not something people
usually do.''

 &HT;    Visit to Chicago a lesson in architecture
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ No matter the mayhem or magic the past 100 years,
Chicago's big shoulders just shrug. Al Capone. Michael Jordan.
Brutal winters, broiling summers. Fixed elections, the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Take it as it comes could be this city's motto.
</P>
<P>
   Chicagoans have always favored functional over frivolous.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with it Chi-town style began with the Great Fire of
1871. It's the reason the Midwest's biggest city has the most
interesting buildings in the country, according to members of the
American Institute of Architects.
</P>
<P>
   ``For architects particularly, there's such a high concentration
of high-quality buildings in this city,'' says Kevin Harrington,
co-editor of ``Chicago's Famous Buildings.'' ``It's not that it's
the only terrific architecture in the country, that would be silly,
but there is this very high concentration of skyscrapers in the
Loop and incredible suburban houses with Frank Lloyd Wright the
major figure there.''
</P>
<P>
   It starts with the location on Lake Michigan, which made Chicago
an important link to the Mississippi River. This was a boom town
right up until the 1871 fire leveled the empire built of wood _
even the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 4-square-mile city burned, taking more than 250
lives, 17,000 buildings and leaving 100,000 homeless. Once the
devastation was cleared, Chicago became a magnet for top architects
of the day. That influx resulted in the eclectic Chicago School of
Architecture and one of the country's first skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   William LeBaron Jenney designed one of the first metal-frame
buildings, 10 stories, in 1885. The Home Insurance Building was
eventually demolished along with dozens of other architectural
treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of Chicago is that it had to grow quickly,
accommodate a large number of people in a relatively small space,''
says Tim Samuelson, curator of architecture at the Chicago
Historical Society. ``Those architectural solutions were unlike
what anyone had done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has always been an architectural laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people consider Chicago to have the seeds of modern
architecture,'' adds Samuelson. ``The buildings are functional and
beautiful and express time, place and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, visitors can peer at the ``cliff'' of Michigan
Avenue buildings facing Lake Michigan and throughout the Loop, so
named because the elevated train loops around the shopping core.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's obsession with buildings that look great and work is
everywhere. It includes the Chicago Cultural Center (1897), Art
Institute (1893), Museum of Science and Industry (1892) and
department stores Marshall Field's (1892-1914) and Carson Pirie
Scott (1899).
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 surviving architectural masterpieces that stood in
1900, you can take your own millennium march downtown and see the
Late Victorian Gothic limestone Holy Name Cathedral, the Gothic
Water Tower and Italian Renaissance Cultural Center with its
Tiffany stained-glass dome.
</P>
<P>
   This walking tour will entertain even nonhistory buffs. Along
the way there are cafes and great shopping at places like the Water
Tower Place mall, a Nike Town and Sony store on Michigan Avenue and
three floors of Old Navy at Washington and State streets.

 &HT;    Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch fits today's idea of style
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Is Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch everywhere, or
does it just seem that way?
</P>
<P>
   The clothing retailer is on the radio. Listen to LFO's lilting
single ``Summer Girls,'' at No. 3 on the Billboard singles chart:
``I like girls that wear Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch... '' (Entertainment
Weekly declared it Best Plug of the Summer.)
</P>
<P>
   Its name is on the lips of brokers as a stock to stick with.
</P>
<P>
   And this fall Abercrombie will unveil its first TV commercials,
as well as guest-star on the hyped Fox show ``Get Real.''
</P>
<P>
   Costume designer Kathleen Detoro chose Abercrombie's blue jeans
and cargo pants to give the teen-age cast members of ``Get Real''
an up-to-the-minute look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funky. It's hip. It's all-natural. Everyone loves it,''
Detoro says.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly white-collared retail analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch has enjoyed an
incredible run, posting net sales of $199 million in the second
quarter of 1999, a 74 percent increase in net income from the
previous year and its 28th consecutive quarter of record sales and
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the company netted $816 million in sales, up 56
percent from the year before. Analysts expect the company's
earnings to grow about 30 percent in each of the next three years.
(Compare that with their expectations for The Gap: 19 percent
annually in the same time frame.)
</P>
<P>
   The brand is succeeding thanks to its obsessive attention to
detail in all aspects of its stores and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie encourages its youthful sales force to adopt the
casual look it's hawking, meaning clerks wear baseball caps and
flip-flops and generally look ready for a game of touch football.
Or a kegger.
</P>
<P>
   It produces a 300-page ``magalogue'' available by subscription.
</P>
<P>
   And each quarter it issues seven different shopping bags, sought
after for their sexy images.
</P>
<P>
   While fashionable, the store's lifestyle-driven merchandise
doesn't follow or try to set trends. At its core is an athletic,
casual collegiate look that's been around for decades: Comfortable
cargo pants, slouchy jerseys and beat-up baseball caps. No sheer
blouses, no velvet bell bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny embellishments keep the look fresh and create a demand for
the brand: zip-off pant legs, for instance, or embroidery added to
pockets or cuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can continue to ship khakis and denims and T-shirts to
a store, but (chief executive) Michael Jeffries continues to find
ways to update the stylings, whether it's a new treatment in the
wash, a new pocket, a new graphic,'' says retail analyst Todd
Slater of Lazard &AMP; Freres Co. in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   All told, it's a formula for success that the company vigorously
protects. It sued American Eagle Outfitters, alleging that the
rival clothier copied A&AMP;F's image and business practices. A federal
judge threw out the suit in July, but Abercrombie plans to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch began life in 1892 as a high-end camping,
fishing and hunting gear store in New York City. Clients included
outdoorsmen and adventurers such as Teddy Roosevelt and Richard
Byrd. The store went bankrupt in 1977 and was purchased by Oshman's
Sporting Goods. Limited Inc., the retailing behemoth that also owns
Victoria's Secret and Express, purchased A&AMP;F in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie sold 15 percent of its shares to the public three
years ago, and spun-off completely from Limited Inc. in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Abercrombie has steadily grown, from 25 stores in
1988 to almost 200 now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has this great outdoors, all-American cachet and legacy,''
Slater says. But for a while, the store seemed to be ``lost in
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter chief executive Jeffries, who recognized the following
major but long-term trends:
</P>
<P>
   _ A growing young population, the so-called echo boom of 27
million teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The casualization of American fashion and dressing.
</P>
<P>
   _ An increasingly active American lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   _ A desire for quality goods.
</P>
<P>
   The company homed in on 18- to 22-year-olds, but the clothes
actually attract a wider group of wearers. ``Younger people want to
emulate their older brothers and sisters, and older people want to
be, feel and act younger,'' Slater says.
</P>
<P>
   The company's catalogue _ or magalogue, for it includes articles
on music, movies and books _ plumbs aspects of college life such as
dating, drinking and semesters abroad. Its paid circulation tops
250,000; single copies of the hefty 300-page book can be purchased
in A&AMP;F stores for $6.
</P>
<P>
   Now entering its third year, A&AMP;F Quarterly has become so
collectible that old issues are up for auction on ebay.com.
</P>
<P>
   But because of its sometimes racy content, the catalogue also
has attracted controversy. Mothers Against Drunk Driving protested
the Fall '98 book, which was eventually recalled, for a game called
Drinking 101 that included cocktail recipes. Parents in
Massachusetts have signed petitions protesting the catalog's
semi-nude photos by famed shutterbug Bruce Weber.
</P>
<P>
   In his slick black-and-white shots, the catalog portrays a kind
of casually moneyed uniformity often associated, however unfairly,
with sororities and fraternities.
</P>
<P>
   But from her vantage point as Greek reporter at The Independent
Florida Alligator at the University of Florida, senior Corrine
Simon doesn't see a huge Abercrombie presence, ``not any more than
any other style on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a different story back at Simon's home in Raleigh, N.C.
``Let me put it this way _ my 14-year-old sister loves Abercrombie,
my 17-year-old sister is over it. She thinks it's silly,'' Simon
says. ``My mom hates it because it's so expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fitch look does fetch a pretty penny. Boxers are $18.50,
T-shirts are $29.50, and corduroys cost $69.50.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the items that don't even look new. ``Beyond
destroyed'' baseball caps, with their deliberately ragged bills, go
for $24.50 each. Faded _ make that ``vintage washed'' _ jeans start
at $49.50 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   Having clothes pre-distressed adds to their individuality, says
company spokesman Hampton Carney. ``No two things are exactly alike
when they're trashed like that.''
</P>
<P>
   At some stores, the post-college crowd comes in for weekend
clothes, and middle-school students especially crave the shopping
bags. (Once scissored and taped, the bags can cover textbooks.)
</P>
<P>
   Locally, trendier items such as capris sell well and, among the
younger set, sweatshirts are popular. ``It's cold in school, and
they like to have that to throw on,'' Borden says.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, the bulk of shoppers emerging from the
Abercrombie store weren't college coeds but teen-age girls such as
Kim Staruk, a senior at Cardinal Newman High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``A desire for khakis'' lured her to the store because she likes
``the worn look.'' So much that she also owns a pair of fashionably
frayed Abercrombie jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Or like the two sisters on a hurried mall expedition with their
mom. Both were carting bags of shirts and jackets because
Abercrombie is ``different from what other people wear'' in
Melbourne, where high school girls frequent Wet Seal and Contempo.
</P>
<P>
   That very rarity is what makes analysts such as Slater smile.
The Gap has dozens of stores in the New York metropolitan area;
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch has one. ``They're not oversaturated,'' Slater
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an investment point of view, there's still tremendous
juice in this brand.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Lice resistant to treatment have experts
scratching their heads
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta mother Randy Foster had done all the typical
things to get rid of the head lice in her daughter's hair. She
bought the chemical cream rinses, vacuumed the carpets, bagged the
toys and picked out the eggs, known as nits, with a metal comb.
</P>
<P>
   None of it worked. After more than six weeks of frustration,
Foster tried a decades-old treatment _ Vaseline, slathered on the
scalp _ to smother the lice. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody warned me about how hard it was going to be to get rid
of them,'' Foster said. ``No one told us how this was going to turn
our lives upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster said she believes her daughter, Chelsea, may have been
infested with lice that had developed resistance to typical
chemical treatments _ a trend that may afflict scores of families
and schools, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are unable to say how widespread the problem
of ``super lice'' may be in the United States, other countries have
documented a rise in resistant lice. And researchers at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta acknowledge that they
are seeing significant anecdotal evidence of tougher bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a lot of frustrated parents, lots of frustrated
physicians and lots of frustrated school nurses,'' said Sue
Partridge, spokeswoman for the CDC's Division of Parasitic
Diseases. Lice outbreaks _ whether due to ``super lice'' or just
widespread, inconsistent follow-up care _ are now ``a major concern
for school nurses,'' Partridge said.
</P>
<P>
   With the first weeks of school behind them, teachers and public
health workers are bracing for a bumper crop of head lice this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always seen some cases,'' said Tammy Hamilton,
spokeswoman for the Cobb County Board of Health. ``But in the past
few years, we've noticed a dramatic increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Many metro Atlanta schools are trying to control the insects
with new no-nit policies, which require students to leave school
immediately if a nit, or lice egg, is found. And public health
workers are stepping up prevention efforts, urging parents to check
their children's scalps every Friday night and suggesting that some
schools bag hats or coats as students walk into the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta public schools, Parent Teacher Association meetings
are planned to discuss strategies to eliminate lice, said Jayketa
Singleton, a health services clinical adviser to the district. In
Cobb County, the health department has a designated nurse who
travels the district to educate school nurses and parents about
lice.
</P>
<P>
   And at Westchester Elementary School, Principal Cheryl Kuebler
lets parents borrow nit combs, including the Robicomb, an electric
tool that kills lice with a satisfying zap. Kuebler, fondly known
to faculty and students as the Lice Lady, is more prepared than
most. A few years ago, her school struggled with a near epidemic of
lice and took several approaches to end the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot, and I became very proactive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kuebler recommends such family activities like Friday night
lice checks, writes articles about lice for the school newsletter
and personally does class checks _ bringing youngsters to the
classroom windows and gingerly poking around their hair with a
pencil. ``I'm pretty good at finding the things at this point,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is the school has not seen any more widespread
outbreaks _ ``knock on wood,'' she said. But many metro Atlanta
schools _ and parents _ will not be so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a public relations manager for the accounting firm KPMG,
never dreamed that an itty-bitty bug could be so persistent. Foster
doused Chelsea's hair in over-the-counter lice products. They
didn't work. She went through Chelsea's hair with a metal comb,
looking for nits, or lice eggs. When that didn't work, she picked
out nits strand-by-strand and cut them out.
</P>
<P>
   She cleaned the house, the toys, the clothes and the linens _
repeatedly. And after researching books and Web sites, she finally
slathered Chelsea's hair in Vaseline, videotaped the special moment
for posterity, and capped her hair overnight. That finally killed
the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really long and ugly and exhausting,'' said Foster, who
said she kept Chelsea, then 3 years old, still for the daily
inspections with stacks of videos and ``lots of bribes'' for six
weeks. ``I put my poor kid through hell. She was a real trouper.''
</P>
<P>
   Singleton said Foster's story is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   When talking to PTA groups last year about how to combat lice,
she said she heard parents repeatedly vent their frustration over
fighting lice.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone, regardless of economic status, can get lice. Even
Cleopatra owned a nit comb.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not children with dirty hair,'' Thompson said about
the cases she's seen. ``These are children well cared for, with
clean hair.''
</P>
<P>
   But girls tend to have higher numbers of lice and nits, because
they often have longer hair and they tend to do more head-to-head
activities that promote the spread of the insects, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   And lice tend to attack whites, Asians and Hispanics more than
African-American boys and girls, experts say. The reason: The
texture of African-American hair makes it difficult for nits to
attach. And often, boys and girls have hair styles that are either
extremely short or tightly braided, both factors that discourage an
infestation.
</P>
<P>
   When a lice outbreak occurs, things often degenerate into a
blame game, which can complicate efforts to solve the problem.
Parents blame the schools for not being aggressive enough in
stopping infestations by keeping common areas of schools free of
lice and sending infested students home. Schools blame parents for
inconsistent follow-up treatment for lice. Public health workers
say once a child has lice, the parents must be diligent about
shampooing, nit-picking, cleaning and vacuuming their homes for at
least a month to make sure all bugs are dead.
</P>
<P>
   A second complication is that lice treatment can be expensive.
Americans spend about $100 million a year on cream rinses and
shampoos that contain delousing agents, according to the National
Pediculosis Association. And Nix, the No. 1 lice treatment, has
raked in more than $40 million each year since 1997, when annual
sales of the over-the-counter product doubled, according to its
distributor, Warner Lambert. A family can easily rack up a $60 to
$70 bill to treat a single lice infestation. Chemical cream rinses,
which need to be used twice within one week, cost between $10 and
$20 a pop per person. And fine-toothed nit combs cost between $10
and $15.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest hurdle to combating lice in the past decade has
been that more parents are finding that typical treatments _ such
as permethrin, the active ingredient in Nix _ don't seem to be
working anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A survey taken at the 1998 annual meeting of the National
Association of School Nurses found, for instance, that more than 80
percent of the respondents reported an increase in the failure of
chemical treatments to stop lice outbreaks in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent unpublished Harvard University study found more
than 200 lice, harvested from the heads of 57 children, survived in
petri dishes treated with permethrin. In contrast, the researchers
showed that 67 lice from children in the Philippines, who use
chemical treatments far less frequently, quickly died after
exposure to permethrin, except one, which apparently escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC has not seen definitive evidence of ``super lice'' in
the United States, although they have been identified in other
nations. But the experts acknowledge lice studies are rare, since
the bugs are neither glamorous nor dangerous and only live on
humans, making laboratory studies of lice virtually impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and school nurses say they don't need scientists to
confirm what they see every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely seeing something new,'' said Thompson of
Fountain Elementary, who said about 20 percent of her student body
contracted lice last year. ``And it's causing real nightmares for
everyone involved.''

 &HT;    Too Keyed up? Make it simple in Islamorada
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMORADA, Fla. _ There are two ways to approach a trip to the
Florida Keys: Take a deep breath and drive the long stretch to Key
West or stop, look and linger along the way.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer the latter. Not only does it make the trek so much more
bearable, it allows you to adjust to the Keys way of life. Which is
to say, slow and easy.
</P>
<P>
   So, when our family of four was planning a visit to Key West, I
suggested a two-night stay in Islamorada, an area fairly well
developed (by Keys standards) but not without its charms. We had
already dropped anchor at the Cheeca Lodge, Islamorada's most
famous hotel, on a previous trip. Now, we were looking for
something simpler yet still respectable.
</P>
<P>
   We found it at the Pelican Cove Resort.
</P>
<P>
   On first approach, you may be a little skeptical. Pelican Cove
sits perilously close to the sprawling Holiday Isle resort, a
fun-in-the-sun place that seems right at home with the frat-party
crowd. But when you drive down the alley that leads to the cove,
you'll discover a much more subdued establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The resort's main appeal is that every room faces the Atlantic _
or more precisely, a cove that leads to the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Cheeca Lodge offers far more luxurious
accommodations, our room there faced a parking lot, hardly a view
to remember. On our Pelican Cove terrace, we greeted the morning
sun as it crept above the horizon _ and we sat at night in the
moonless dark, listening to nothing but the stillness of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a water scooter-rental business makes the midday
a more noisy affair.
</P>
<P>
   As for the room itself, it was tight for a family of four, but
it did have a queen-size bed, sleeper sofa and space for a portable
crib (we brought our own, but the hotel will supply one).
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, there was a full kitchen, stocked with all the
dishes and silverware you'll need. The only thing missing was a
place to sit down and eat, save for a small table on the terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we managed to have most of our meals in the room,
including breakfast, which the hotel provides free (don't get
excited _ it's just juice, coffee and doughnuts). Our one big meal
out was at the Islamorada Fish Company, a first-class seafood
eatery that sits on the water.
</P>
<P>
   We spent a good chunk of our time hanging out at the hotel,
splashing in the pool and Jacuzzi and sipping frozen drinks at the
tiki bar. There's also a small, sandy beach of the man-made
variety: At first, I scoffed at it. But when my 7-year-old son and
I spent the better part of an afternoon snorkeling in the salty
waters, I realized it was a nice amenity.
</P>
<P>
   Venturing beyond the hotel, we found ways to amuse ourselves. We
skipped a visit to the touristy Theater of the Sea, which is next
to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we took a morning drive to the Florida Keys Wild Bird
Center in nearby Tavernier, where we saw what must have been a
gazillion varieties of the winged creatures.
</P>
<P>
   The center takes in injured birds and either rehabilitates them
or provides them a permanent home. Leaving the sanctuary, we
visited The Key Lime Tree store, whose name tells it all: From pies
to candles to mustard, if it comes with key lime, this Key Largo
store has it.
</P>
<P>
   We also spent another eventful morning engaging in the newest of
Keys pastimes _ swimming with the dolphins. There are about a
half-dozen places to do this throughout the stretch of islands, all
requiring reservations well in advance. We got lucky and were able
to take advantage of a last-minute cancellation at Dolphins Plus in
Key Largo.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's it like? To tell the truth, not all that eventful.
Your actual time in the water is limited to about 10 minutes and
the dolphins seem more like trained seals than mysterious creatures
of the deep. Not that it wasn't fun grabbing their fins and being
taken for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   But at $125 a person, it didn't seem worth the expense.
</P>
<P>
   But our three-day trip to Islamorada was worth most any price
tag. We left rested and ready for more adventures.
</P>
<P>
   On to Key West!
</P>

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Allergy alert: Ragweed season revving up
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Does a slice of cold, dribbling watermelon cause a
twitch after you bite into it?
</P>
<P>
   Then you may be allergic to ragweed, the fall-pollinating plant
that's heading toward its seasonal peak production of misery.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, metro Atlanta's pollen count was 56, after hitting 70
on Tuesday, more than double the previous week. Misery should be
full-blown by next week. Counts of 61 to 120 are ``high,'' anything
above is considered ``extremely high,'' a range within the reach
should the stale weather pattern prevail.
</P>
<P>
   People bothered by ragweed often notice their mouth feels itchy
after eating cantaloupe or watermelon. That's because these melons
cross-react with ragweed, creating an allergy symptom that's not
dangerous but helps pinpoint a patient's complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the other day, I had a woman tell me she felt her mouth
itched after eating cantaloupe and I told her, `I bet you're
allergic to ragweed,''' said Dr. Kathleen Sheerin of the Atlanta
Allergy and Asthma Clinic. Allergy skin-testing almost always
proves Sheerin's guess correct.
</P>
<P>
   Rain, wind or a sudden drop in temperature can temporarily lower
the pollen count. But until then, it's prime time for pollen.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we continue to not have rain, and to have high smog
levels, we will continue to have high ragweed counts,'' Sheerin
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, ragweed season lasts through mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   For seasonal allergy sufferers, the plant is a hay fever
heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both qualitatively and quantitatively, it's more bothersome
than tree pollen,'' said Dr. Kevin Schaffer of Lawrenceville's
Allergy &AMP; Asthma Center.
</P>
<P>
   A ragweed pollen count of 20 _ 20 grains per cubic meter of air
_ is as bothersome as tree pollen counts of 200. One ragweed plant
can generate 1 billion grains.
</P>
<P>
   Four-footed types get a double whammy. Not only do dogs and
outdoor cats traipse it indoors on their coats, exposing owners,
but many also sniff, sneeze and snivel themselves. ``With animals,
sometimes allergy symptoms are runny eyes and nose and sometimes
it's itchy skin,'' said Dr. Sharon Tamplin of PetSmart at Perimeter
Mall.
</P>
<P>
   But don't invite those pollen-loaded pets to share your pillow
out of sympathy, Sheerin warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sleep with your cat or dog, you're sleeping with a fur
ball full of ragweed.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Lice resistant to treatment have experts
scratching their heads
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta mother Randy Foster had done all the typical
things to get rid of the head lice in her daughter's hair. She
bought the chemical cream rinses, vacuumed the carpets, bagged the
toys and picked out the eggs, known as nits, with a metal comb.
</P>
<P>
   None of it worked. After more than six weeks of frustration,
Foster tried a decades-old treatment _ Vaseline, slathered on the
scalp _ to smother the lice. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody warned me about how hard it was going to be to get rid
of them,'' Foster said. ``No one told us how this was going to turn
our lives upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster said she believes her daughter, Chelsea, may have been
infested with lice that had developed resistance to typical
chemical treatments _ a trend that may afflict scores of families
and schools, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are unable to say how widespread the problem
of ``super lice'' may be in the United States, other countries have
documented a rise in resistant lice. And researchers at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta acknowledge that they
are seeing significant anecdotal evidence of tougher bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a lot of frustrated parents, lots of frustrated
physicians and lots of frustrated school nurses,'' said Sue
Partridge, spokeswoman for the CDC's Division of Parasitic
Diseases. Lice outbreaks _ whether due to ``super lice'' or just
widespread, inconsistent follow-up care _ are now ``a major concern
for school nurses,'' Partridge said.
</P>
<P>
   With the first weeks of school behind them, teachers and public
health workers are bracing for a bumper crop of head lice this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always seen some cases,'' said Tammy Hamilton,
spokeswoman for the Cobb County Board of Health. ``But in the past
few years, we've noticed a dramatic increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Many metro Atlanta schools are trying to control the insects
with new no-nit policies, which require students to leave school
immediately if a nit, or lice egg, is found. And public health
workers are stepping up prevention efforts, urging parents to check
their children's scalps every Friday night and suggesting that some
schools bag hats or coats as students walk into the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta public schools, Parent Teacher Association meetings
are planned to discuss strategies to eliminate lice, said Jayketa
Singleton, a health services clinical adviser to the district. In
Cobb County, the health department has a designated nurse who
travels the district to educate school nurses and parents about
lice.
</P>
<P>
   And at Westchester Elementary School, Principal Cheryl Kuebler
lets parents borrow nit combs, including the Robicomb, an electric
tool that kills lice with a satisfying zap. Kuebler, fondly known
to faculty and students as the Lice Lady, is more prepared than
most. A few years ago, her school struggled with a near epidemic of
lice and took several approaches to end the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot, and I became very proactive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kuebler recommends such family activities like Friday night
lice checks, writes articles about lice for the school newsletter
and personally does class checks _ bringing youngsters to the
classroom windows and gingerly poking around their hair with a
pencil. ``I'm pretty good at finding the things at this point,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is the school has not seen any more widespread
outbreaks _ ``knock on wood,'' she said. But many metro Atlanta
schools _ and parents _ will not be so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a public relations manager for the accounting firm KPMG,
never dreamed that an itty-bitty bug could be so persistent. Foster
doused Chelsea's hair in over-the-counter lice products. They
didn't work. She went through Chelsea's hair with a metal comb,
looking for nits, or lice eggs. When that didn't work, she picked
out nits strand-by-strand and cut them out.
</P>
<P>
   She cleaned the house, the toys, the clothes and the linens _
repeatedly. And after researching books and Web sites, she finally
slathered Chelsea's hair in Vaseline, videotaped the special moment
for posterity, and capped her hair overnight. That finally killed
the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really long and ugly and exhausting,'' said Foster, who
said she kept Chelsea, then 3 years old, still for the daily
inspections with stacks of videos and ``lots of bribes'' for six
weeks. ``I put my poor kid through hell. She was a real trouper.''
</P>
<P>
   Singleton said Foster's story is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   When talking to PTA groups last year about how to combat lice,
she said she heard parents repeatedly vent their frustration over
fighting lice.
</P>

Cleopatra owned a nit comb.
</P>
<P>

the cases she's seen. ``These are children well cared for, with

   But girls tend to have higher numbers of lice and nits, because
they often have longer hair and they tend to do more head-to-head

</P>

<P>
   A black friend of mine in Mississippi, back in the 1950s, once
told me, ``We won't be really equal until a white man can call a
black an SOB and not be regarded a racist.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to think about that awhile, but I believe I finally
understood what my friend meant. He was, and probably still is, a
mighty smart fellow being able to see that far ahead in those
racially disturbed and disturbing times.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't quite gotten that far along yet in America, but I see
signs of progress in places you might not have seen yet as a place
for such as that to reveal itself.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about books by popular authors of so-called ``Beach
Books,'' books, that is, that might be read mainly while on
vacation, books that supposedly aren't depth bombs intellectually.
At least not in the minds of most critics.
</P>
<P>
   Books by folks such as Robert B. Parker, Robert K. Tanenbaum,
and Jay Brandon. There are others, but those are the authors, the
very popular authors, I happen to have read recently.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, of course, in his Spenser series has all along been an
equal opportunity novelist, as far as race and gender are
concerned. That is, his black characters, principally the heroic
Hawk and lovely and brilliant Susan, have always been as positively
drawn as his Caucasians, if not more so, which often has been the
way of dealing with minorities in popular novels.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Bad Old Days'' black characters were mostly comic
stereotypes, kind and rustically wise maids and Stephen Fetchits.
Then came the heroic black males and other minorities. That was
during the ``politically correct'' era, which hasn't gone away yet,
of course.
</P>
<P>
   But along has come the above named popular novelists to show the
way _ drawing minority characters as good, bad and
everything-in-between, just like regular people. That's a big step
in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   As I used to tell bigots in Mississippi when they would point
out that this or that black person had done wrong: ``They aren't
superior, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   In Parker's new Spenser novel, the bad guy is black and gay.
That's about as politically incorrect as you can get these days.
And it works. Black people and gay people are both bad guys and
good guys, just like in real life. That's got to be progress.
</P>
<P>
   The new Spenser adventure, by the way, is titled ``Hush Money''
(G.P. Putnam's Sons) and is definitely up to Parker's usual high
level of entertainment. If you are a Spenser fan, this is for you.
If you haven't discovered Spenser and friends yet, you're missing
out on some fun reading, whether or not you go to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Brandon's new book is called ``Angel of Death'' (Forge) and,
as usual, is set in San Antonio where the author lives. His
villain, and a master villain he is, is a black politician-deal
maker who works behind the scenes in city politics and whose
opponents often turn up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Even after rookie district attorney Chris Sinclair finally gets
him convicted of one of the murders, he (Malachi Reese is the bad
guy's name) continues to manipulate Sinclair's life from his cell
on death row. The bulk of the story involves the ways and means
Sinclair works to discover how this is done and expose it. Not an
easy task by any means.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes these days _ more and more popular suspense
novelists are proving this genre is where real life action is
revealed, one way or another. It's worth noting for several
reasons, not the least of which is that popular novels reach more
people than those depth bomb so-called ``serious'' books that sing
to the choir as often as not.

 &HT;    Salinger biography offers nothing exciting or new
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ About two years ago, a small press in
Virginia announced it was bringing out a book containing the last
story J.D. Salinger published. It was with the approval of the
legendarily reclusive writer, and it took everybody by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, as anybody knows who has access to the 1965 issue
of The New Yorker in which the story originally appeared, it's
terrible _ more of a rant than anything else, by the supposedly
7-year-old Seymour Glass, exiled in summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the story today is like hearing a voice from beyond the
grave, for Salinger has refused to publish anything since that
story. Well, there was a big fuss kicked up, and before you know it
plans for the book suddenly vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Business as usual for Jerome David Salinger, born in 1919,
author of a couple of really good short stories and a sensitive
15-year-old's idea of the greatest novel ever.
</P>
<P>
   Still, people have bought millions of copies of ``The Catcher in
the Rye'' in the last 50 years, so Salinger must speak to somebody
besides the pathologically alienated Mark David Chapmans of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Alexander, who has previously authored a biography on James
Dean, now steps forward with an unsatisfying biography of Salinger.
</P>
<P>
   As he demonstrates, Salinger's mania for privacy was
long-standing; when ``The Catcher in the Rye'' was published in
1951, he demanded that there be no advance galleys, no publicity,
and he ordered Little, Brown not to send him any reviews.
</P>
<P>
   You can intuit a lot from a writer's characters and how he
treats them, and Salinger's people are a tremulous batch of overly
sensitive, overly caffeinated furtive fault-finders,
suicides-in-waiting, people who cover their wounds by imagining
they're too good for their friends, too good for a society that
just doesn't understand them.
</P>
<P>
   I always think of Salinger as one of the great literary
neurotics, right up there with Sylvia Plath, bound for no good end.
Although he's New York-born-and-bred, he's spent the majority of
his adult life in New England, and that seems perfectly natural,
for by nature he's a New England eccentric, a lonely neighborhood
crank always yelling at the kids to get off his grass.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, his Garbo act has driven people almost literally
nuts; in 1976, a writer published a serious article outlining all
the reasons why J.D. Salinger was writing novels under the name
Thomas Pynchon. (Pynchon, who has a sense of humor, promptly wrote
the writer of the article, explaining that, while some of the
article was true, none of the interesting parts were.)
</P>
<P>
   Would we care as much about Salinger if he'd just gone about his
business and continued publishing, if he'd had some hits and
misses, if his output consisted of more than one novel and 13 short
stories (there are other stories that appeared in magazines in
early years that have never been legally collected).
</P>
<P>
   The answer, manifestly, is no. Familiarity breeds you-know-what.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander dutifully narrates the story of Salinger, a nice
Jewish boy with an edge, who once criticized another writer's work
by saying, ``There's no hidden emotion in these stories. No fire
between the words.'' It's a good capsule description of the
necessities of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger has insisted that he's been assiduously turning out
pages all the years he's been absent from the fray, but Truman
Capote said the same thing. I don't buy it. The urge to create is
inextricably intertwined with the urge to exhibit the creation.
Paul Alexander's main contribution _ if that's the correct word _
to the no-longer burgeoning world of Salinger studies, is to make
plodding innuendos about Salinger being some sort of real-life
Humbert Humbert, based, of course, on his recently revealed
relationship with the odious Joyce Maynard.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, instigating a relationship with Maynard is reason
enough to have your emotional well-being called into question. But
Alexander documents that another of Salinger's later relationships
was with the actress Elaine Joyce, in her late 30s at the time. It
seems safe to say that, while Salinger may like them young, they
don't necessarily have to be that young.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Alexander trudges through a bare-bones recitation of
the half-dozen or so fragmentary Salinger sightings of the last 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   The book adds little to the public record, although I wasn't
aware of the extent of Salinger's bloody service on D-Day and after
(he was in the Fourth Infantry and helped liberate Paris).
</P>
<P>
   If Salinger is inadequate as biography _ Alexander can't even be
bothered to dig up the full name of Salinger's first wife; she's
just ``Sylvia,'' and that's that _ it's also worthless as
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander seems to be under the impression that his readers are
idiots. When he mentions Salinger's flirtation/affair (accounts
differ) with Oona O'Neill, the daughter of Eugene O'Neill and,
later, the wife of Charlie Chaplin, he first gives us a list of her
father's credits, then helpfully informs us that ``In 1941, he was
already one of America's most successful and respected
playwrights.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinger at his best can be a lot like life _ very funny, but
mostly horrendously sad. To Salinger, this book must be counted as
a gnat's buzzing compared to the news that his daughter is writing
a memoir of life with father, to be published next year.

 &HT;    A compilation of every musical, A to G sharp
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For all those who start tapping their
feet at Harry Warren, DeSylva, Brown and Henderson and Rodgers and
Hart, rush out and get ``The Virgin Encyclopedia of Stage and Film
Musicals'' ($29.95). This is one-stop shopping, the equivalent of
Ephraim Katz's ``Film Encylopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   The first entry in this nearly 700-page book is ``A Day in
Hollywood, A Night in the Ukraine,'' the last is ``Zorba,'' and in
between are invariably intelligent entries on film and stage
composers and all the major musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Because the book was originally published in England, there are
items on people who are virtually unknown here _ Sonnie Hale, the
husband of Jessie Matthews _ but that's all to the good. Too much
information is never enough.
</P>
<P>
   A great book for reference, or just for browsing, and a major
achievement for author Colin Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   Before the rainbow ...
</P>
<P>
   Before L. Frank Baum moved to Chicago, where he wrote the ``Oz''
books that made him famous, he spent time on the prairies of South
Dakota, where he wrote a column in the Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   The column was entitled ``Our Landlady,'' and involved the
doings of a hefty landlady and the three boarders she had in her
house. It's a vague precursor of Finlay Peter Dunne's Mr. Dooley,
complete with Irish dialect, except Dunne used a bar for his
colloquies instead of a boarding house.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Nebraska's Bison imprint has issued an
annotated volume of ``Our Landlady'' ($16.95), and the columns are
interesting windows on the 1890s, immigrant life, and Baum's own
highly pressured life. Nancy Koupal's annotations make some
now-obscure references clear. People interested in Baum should get
the book immediately, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Only 16 months to go ...
</P>
<P>
   Republican front-runner George W. Bush is the subject of several
upcoming books, among them Molly Ivins' ``Shrub: The Short But
Happy Political Life of George W. Bush'' from Random House in
February, Elizabeth Mitchell's ``W.,'' from Hyperion in January and
Bill Minutaglio's ``First Son: George W. Bush and the Bush Family
Dynasty'' from Times Books in September.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush's own as-told-to book, ``A Charge to Keep,''
will be out from Morrow in November.

   HARRY _ Don't be surprised if the print on this page disappears
after you've read it or a large screech owl suddenly swoops down
and makes off with your newspaper. If all of this sounds
far-fetched and impossible, then you're obviously a Muggle and
shouldn't be reading this story anyhow. If, on the other hand, it
all sounds perfectly plausible, you may be destined to become a
Harry Potter fan. You won't be alone. The 11-year-old wizard has
successfully cast his spell on both children and adults alike and
has become a regular on best seller lists in America and abroad _
first in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, then in Harry
Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. (Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   HARRY-ILLUSTRATOR _ Mary Grandpre was handed the awesome task of
determining exactly how an 11-year-old wizard named Harry Potter
would look. ``I thought it was like any other job _ one time, one
cover,'' says the 45-year-old free-lance illustrator who never
dreamed the book would become a worldwide phenomenon. She will
eventually illustrate all seven books planned for the popular
series. (Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ When Ayn Rand died in 1982, the ideas that made
her a countercultural goddess to generations of college students
and armchair intellectuals had filtered into popular thought, where
their provenance was not always apparent or acknowledged. The
effluent had become the mainstream, something never before seen in
the history of hydraulics. When you hear educators talk about
``self-esteem,'' you're hearing the echo of Ayn Rand. When you hear
Neal Boortz yammering on about ``logic'' and ``thought process,''
you're getting a pure draft of the robust egotism that Rand
espoused in ``The Fountainhead'' and ``Atlas Shrugged.'' (Skube,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY.

<P>
   BOOK-FALL _ Frank McCourt's breathlessly anticipated ``'Tis,'' a
memoir that picks up where the best-selling ``Angela's Ashes'' left
off, heads an impressive list of nonfiction for the fall. And in
fiction, Toni Cade Bambara's ``Those Bones Are Not My Child,'' her
posthumously published novel based on Atlanta's child killings,
surely will strike a nerve among people who recall that chilling
time in this city. Space doesn't allow for a comprehensive rundown
of what's coming up this season, but these are some of the
highlights. (Weaver, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BOOK-NOTES _ Don O'Briant's book notes. Sibley Fleming has

you love and trust is so much more important than partying,'' says
Jo Davenport, a 43-year-old Lithonia, Ga., office manager who will

   HARRY _ Don't be surprised if the print on this page disappears
after you've read it or a large screech owl suddenly swoops down
and makes off with your newspaper. If all of this sounds
far-fetched and impossible, then you're obviously a Muggle and
shouldn't be reading this story anyhow. If, on the other hand, it
all sounds perfectly plausible, you may be destined to become a
Harry Potter fan. You won't be alone. The 11-year-old wizard has
successfully cast his spell on both children and adults alike and
has become a regular on best seller lists in America and abroad _
first in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, then in Harry
Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. (Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   HARRY-ILLUSTRATOR _ Mary Grandpre was handed the awesome task of
determining exactly how an 11-year-old wizard named Harry Potter
would look. ``I thought it was like any other job _ one time, one
cover,'' says the 45-year-old free-lance illustrator who never
dreamed the book would become a worldwide phenomenon. She will
eventually illustrate all seven books planned for the popular
series. (Dayton Daily News)

<P>
   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ When Ayn Rand died in 1982, the ideas that made
her a countercultural goddess to generations of college students
and armchair intellectuals had filtered into popular thought, where
their provenance was not always apparent or acknowledged. The
effluent had become the mainstream, something never before seen in
the history of hydraulics. When you hear educators talk about
``self-esteem,'' you're hearing the echo of Ayn Rand. When you hear
Neal Boortz yammering on about ``logic'' and ``thought process,''
you're getting a pure draft of the robust egotism that Rand
espoused in ``The Fountainhead'' and ``Atlas Shrugged.'' (Skube,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY.

   BOOK-FALL _ Frank McCourt's breathlessly anticipated ``'Tis,'' a
memoir that picks up where the best-selling ``Angela's Ashes'' left
off, heads an impressive list of nonfiction for the fall. And in
fiction, Toni Cade Bambara's ``Those Bones Are Not My Child,'' her
posthumously published novel based on Atlanta's child killings,
surely will strike a nerve among people who recall that chilling
time in this city. Space doesn't allow for a comprehensive rundown

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Thursday brushed
aside calls for her resignation as she announced the appointment of
former Republican Sen. John Danforth to investigate the FBI's April
1993 raid on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't run from controversy, and I don't run from situations
where we need to pursue the matter to get to the truth and then
take whatever steps are appropriate,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's embattled top law enforcement officer appeared with
Danforth, 62, a Republican, an 18-year veteran of the Senate, and a
former Missouri attorney general. Her action was part of an effort
to blunt cascading criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill over
revelations that the FBI launched incendiary tear-gas devices into
the compound on the last day of its 51-day siege there.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott on Wednesday became the latest
and most senior Republican on Capitol Hill to call on Reno to quit.
``I think the attorney general is falling into a pattern of not
showing competence or probity ... The attorney general should
resign,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   For six years FBI officials and Reno had denied that agents had
used such devices. They still maintain that even though the
canisters were used, the fire that swept the compound was set by
the Davidians themselves. Reno, who defended the FBI's actions in
the April 19, 1993, raid, became enraged when the FBI finally
acknowledged use of the devices on Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   At a packed news conference Thursday, Danforth said he had been
assured complete independence to conduct a probe under laws and
regulations empowering the attorney general to appoint special
counsels to investigate matters that pose a conflict for the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he has authority to subpoena witnesses, to empanel
a grand jury and to question both Reno and FBI Director Louis
Freeh. He did not say whether he will.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department press release quoted Freeh as saying, ``I
welcome the attorney general's selection of Senator Danforth.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno praised Danforth as ``a man of impeccable credentials, a
record of integrity and a determination to get to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The former senator, now in private law practice in St. Louis,
said he will steer clear of investigating what he termed ``judgment
calls'' by law enforcement in the events leading up to the FBI's
final raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country can survive bad judgment. But the thing that
really undermines the integrity of government is whether there were
bad acts,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   Judgment calls, he added, include whether there was
justification in the first place for the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms to initiate an investigation of the Branch
Davidians for firearms violations, Danforth said. Four BATF agents
were killed in a shootout at the Davidian compound on Feb. 28,
1993, an event that started the FBI's 51-day standoff with the
cult.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's probe will focus on what he called ``the dark
questions ... was there a cover-up? That's a dark question. Did the
government kill people? How did the fire start? And was there
shooting (by the FBI)?'' Such questions ``go to the basic integrity
of government, not judgment calls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's order appointing the senator directs him to investigate
whether any FBI agent or other government official lied or withheld
evidence evidence in the aftermath of the Waco disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth will be assisted by Edward Dowd, the U.S. attorney in
St. Louis, a Clinton administration appointee. Dowd will resign his
position and begin building a staff of lawyers and investigators
initially out of Danforth's St. Louis law office.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said FBI agents will not be used to do investigative
work in his probe. He also said he has no intention of asking
Congress to halt its own investigations of Waco until his is
complete. Several such probes are under way, with Republican
leaders promising open hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell people in Congress what to do,'' he said. ``I
wouldn't begin to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects his own probe to be completed by the end of
President Clinton's term, which is Jan. 20, 2001.

<P>
   Although the validity of 19th-century phrenology _ the reading
of bumps on the head to determine character _ has long been
debunked, it could be fun to find out what knots on your noggin
reveal about you.
</P>
<P>
   A phrenologist is but one of the many tradespeople you'll
encounter Saturday at the Harvest Celebration and Annual Trades
Fair at the Homeplace-1850. The northwest Tennessee farm is part of
the Tennessee Valley Authority's Land Between the Lakes National
Recreation Area. In Pryor Hollow in Stewart County, it lies within
the area called the Trace between the Cumberland and Tennessee
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The event will feature 1850s harvest activities, including
demonstrations of traditional farm chores such as fall plowing,
candle dipping, apple butter making and cider pressing.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the living history farm, traditional tradespeople
will demonstrate and explain their crafts, including basketry,
coopering, pottery, weaving, chair making, spinning and tin work. A
milliner and tailor will create period hats and fashions.
</P>
<P>
   The Homeplace-1850 features 16 log structures, 14 of them
original, relocated from within 10 miles of Pryor Hollow. The farm
showcases several historic breeds of domestic animals (milking
shorthorn cattle, Cotswold sheep, Dominique hens and Tamworth
hogs), and all crops and vegetables are heirloom varieties.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday. Admission is $5.50 for
ages 13 and older; $4 for 5-12; and under 4 free. 1-800-525-7077 or

   Many Southeastern cities, resorts and attractions have been, as
they say around these parts, ``fixin' '' to make New Year's Eve
plans for several months. As the dawn of 2000 fast approaches, it
appears some are finally getting their act together.
</P>
<P>
   From Fort Lauderdale to Colonial Williamsburg, organizers are
preparing to put a Dixie spin on the Y2K festivities. In Atlanta,
revelers can enjoy a trio of celebrations downtown _ the
alcohol-free First Night fete in Midtown, the annual Peach Drop at
Underground and the Carnivale of Lights fireworks and illuminations
display at locations between Baker Street and Underground. Several
of the city's upscale hotels are hosting swanky soirees _ the
Ritz-Carlton Buckhead has the Crescendo Ball, a benefit for the
Georgia March of Dimes that will set you back $1,100 per person.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a New Year's party that's away from
Atlanta's crowds and traffic, you don't have to travel far. There
are numerous options in Georgia and around the South. Here are some
highlights:
</P>
<P>
   ALABAMA
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tuskegee. It's only 2 years old, but the annual New Year's Eve
Peanut Drop is well on its way to becoming a beloved tradition.
Folks come from all over Alabama to witness a seven-foot peanut
descending from atop the Kellogg Conference Center, in the fashion
of Times Square's more mundane ball. And the giant goober isn't the
only draw _ there's also a dinner of black-eyed peas, collard
greens and corn bread, a carved peanut ice sculpture, dancing,
singing and peanut-theme decorations. Call 1-800-949-6161 for
information.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fort Lauderdale. The 29 communities that make up greater Fort
Lauderdale are banding together to light up South Florida for New
Year's Eve. Pack the kids off to the free Munchkin Ball at the
Riverwalk entertainment district in downtown Fort Lauderdale, then
head to nearby Sunrise to catch a concert by the Bee Gees _ tickets
are $50-$300, through Ticketmaster. At midnight, fireworks will

 &HT;    In special places, with familiar faces, Atlantans celebrate
millennium
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 12.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's 10 seconds until the historic Y2K rollover, and
from Times Square to the Taj Mahal the world party is peaking.
Where on earth are you?
</P>
<P>
   If you're like many metro Atlantans, you'll be counting down the
last moments of the most anticipated New Year's Eve in, well, a
thousand years somewhere far from Underground's plummeting peach.
(Fussy fact-checkers remind us, of course, that the actual
millennium doesn't start until Jan. 1, 2001.)
</P>
<P>
   But unlike, say, the half-million revelers expected to pack
Times Square, some Atlantans don't want to be with the most people.
They want to be with the best people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more exciting for me than to welcome the new
millennium in Europe with the woman I love,'' says Noah Teal of
Lawrenceville, Ga. A writer for an online commerce company, Teal,
27, plans to visit his girlfriend, Malin-Maria Landwall, in
Stockholm, Sweden. The two plan to spend a few nights at the city's
weeklong millennium celebration, do some sightseeing and share some
quality time.
</P>
<P>
   Teal has been preparing for his Y2K trip for a year. ``It's kind
of like Halley's Comet,'' he says. ``It only comes around so often.
I want to share it with someone special.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who answered our printed and online solicitations to
share their New Year's plans echo his sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being with people you love and trust is so much more important
than partying,'' says Jo Davenport. The 43-year-old Lithonia, Ga.,
office manager will celebrate the millennium with friends in
Middleton, Nova Scotia _ far from big-city crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Middleton is very small,'' she says. ``It's only got one gas
station. I call it the Andy Griffith town.'' And there's no place
Davenport would rather be on the Big Night. ``I've lived in the
city for 20 years, and it wears on you after a while,'' says the
Williamsburg, Va., native.
</P>
<P>
   She's looking forward to watching Middleton's modest fireworks
display and catching up with her pals. ``My friends are like
family,'' Davenport says. ``A party is gone the next day, but we'll
always have memories of being together on this occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Atlantans are keeping their Y2K travel plans all in the
family. Barbara Stein, a fastener saleswoman from Lawrenceville,
can't wait to go on a millennium cruise to Cozumel with her father,
sister and two brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother decided about six months ago that we should all be
together to celebrate the new millennium,'' she says. ``Amazingly,
we all agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   The brood will be sailing on the high seas come New Year's Eve.
``I'm sure there will be mass hysteria on the boat,'' jokes Stein,
55. She admits to having a small case of Y2K fever herself. ``For
me, it's very exciting _ the idea of bringing in a new century. Now
our children, that's another story. They'll probably just be
concerned with running around and eating.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the dreaded Y2K bug, which threatens to knock out
computer systems the world over, stranding travelers? Stein isn't
worried. ``There'll be bathroom facilities and food on the ship,
that's all I care about,'' she says. ``And so what if I miss a few
days work?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, none of the Georgians we talked to expressed serious
reservations about traveling during the holidays. Davenport even
hoped Y2K fears would drive prices down so she could get a better
deal on airfare to Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Diaf of Conyers, Ga., is mildly concerned but thinks
she's found a solution _ go earlier and stay later. ``We'll be gone
for three weeks,'' says the 34-year-old administrative assistant
for a legal recruiting firm. ``We hope we're traveling far enough
on either side to miss any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaf, her husband, Rashid, 37, and the couple's 3-year-old
daughter, Anya, are also reuniting with family. They'll spend
Christmas with Rashid's brother in Paris and New Year's with a
cousin in France's Bordeaux region. After that, they plan on
traveling to Tunisia to meet Rashid's mother, who lives in Algeria.
It will be the first time Anya has seen her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Jo H. Gilbert, 63, of Athens, Ga., is using the occasion to
indulge her husband's love of college football. ``Charlie's always
wanted to go the Rose Bowl,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Gilberts have been to the Cotton Bowl and the Sugar Bowl,
but never to the granddaddy of them all. Then, last October,
Gilbert won four tickets to Pasadena in a contest. It was a great
stroke of luck for the retired couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on Social Security, you don't get to go on too
many big trips,'' says Jo, a former administrative secretary for
the University of Georgia's R.O.T.C. department.
</P>
<P>
   Besides attending the game, the Gilberts plan to get curbside
seats for the Rose Bowl parade and may visit Beverly Hills. ``I've
always wanted to see Rodeo Drive,'' Jo says, ``even though I can
only afford to buy maybe a shopping bag.''
</P>
<P>
   History looms large in some travelers' plans. Barbara and Bill
Farthing of Dunwoody, Ga., aim to make their mark on the
millennium, and celebrate a personal milestone in the bargain. The
pair will travel to London, where they'll sign the Queen's Visitors
Book at Buckingham Palace and pick up some millennium mementos at
the Queen's Gallery shop next door. They will keep their pens at
the ready as they continue to Paris, where they will inscribe a
wish for peace on the Millennium Wall at the Palais de Chaillot.
</P>
<P>
   The Farthings will also celebrate their 54th wedding anniversary
in the City of Light, on _ you guessed it, Dec. 31. ``We were in
Paris for our 25th anniversary,'' says Barbara, 71, a retired grade
school teacher who now works as a travel agent. They are avowed
history buffs, especially of Britain. ``Both of our families are
from the area around Kent,'' Barbara explains. ``Farthing is, in
fact, a British coin, worth about one fourth of a penny. So that
means I'm the cheapest girl in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Parsons of northeast Atlanta will celebrate the New Year's
holiday by sharing part of his past with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, 75, was a bombardier in the Air Force during World War
II. In 1944, he was on leave in London, staying at a
bed-and-breakfast in Russell Square, when the Nazis bombed the
area. ``I got blown out of bed and I inhaled broken glass,''
Parsons remembers.
</P>
<P>
   He'll revisit Russell Square on his millennium trip to London
with his wife, Sara, granddaughter Larissa McMichael and her
husband, Stan McMichael. Parsons hopes to drop by the B&AMP;B, which he
believes is still standing, and take in such popular attractions as
the Tower of London and Big Ben.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sara and I have been to London many times,'' he says. ``But
this is the first time we'll have Stan and Larissa with us. Seeing
things you've seen before through the eyes of people who haven't
witnessed them is exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially at a century's dawning.

   The champagne is chilling in Boston and Belize. The bands are
tuning up in Toronto and Tasmania. All over the planet, people are
preparing for the New Year's Eve party of a lifetime _ and there
appear to be as many ways of ushering in the year 2000 as there are
cultures on Earth. Here's a look at a few of the celebrations:
</P>
<P>
   UNITED STATES
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Boston. Beantown hosted the original First Night celebration _
the family-oriented, alcohol-free New Year's Eve event that is now
replicated in more than 200 cities. This year's three-day party
promises to be the largest of its kind in the country, with
organizers expecting more than 3 million revelers. Events include
Mardi Gras-style parades down Boylston Street and a New Year's Eve
concert by the Boston Pops at City Hall Plaza. The Boston Federal
Courthouse is the site of Front Row at First Night, a black-tie
gala cosponsored by First Night Boston. The party features live
swing, pop and jazz music, a continuous dinner buffet and TV
screens showing satellite feeds of Y2K celebrations around the
world. Tickets are $500 per person; call 1-800-894-2927 to order.
For information on First Night Boston events, call 617-542-1399.
For details on First Night events around the country, visit
www.firstnight.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Chicago. The Windy City is throwing a 2,000-Minute Party, a
multilocation bash that begins at 9 a.m. Dec. 31 and doesn't stop
until the last horn is tooted at 6:20 p.m. Jan. 1. On New Year's
Eve, thousands will gather at the Water and Light New Year's
Celebration at Navy Pier on Lake Michigan. A clock on the pier's
150-foot Ferris wheel will count down the seconds until midnight,
when the sky over the Chicago River will light up with fireworks
and lasers. Also scheduled: S.A.F.E. NightSafe, a two-day family
event. For information on city events, call 312-744-2400 or visit
www.ci.chi.il.us/tourism.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New York. It wouldn't be New Year's Eve without a party in
Times Square. Rid of its sleaze quotient by city initiatives and
corporate investment, the Manhattan tourist zone should draw a
record number of revelers to its Y2K festivities. Times Square's
24-hour party commences at 7 a.m. Dec. 31 and peaks, of course,
with the famous midnight ball drop. Other New York events:
Celebration 2000 Party of the Century, featuring performances by
Sting, Andrea Bocelli, Aretha Franklin and others; and OpSail 2000,
a tall ship parade in New York Harbor. 1-800-692-8474 or
www.nycvisit.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Philadelphia. The City of Brotherly Love aims to draw
thousands of visitors with 24 hours of free events. The party
begins at 7 a.m. Dec. 31 with the Rocky Run, when 2,000 runners
will retrace Sylvester Stallone's path up the Philadelphia Museum
of Art front steps. At 2 p.m. on New Year's Eve, Mayor Edward G.
Rendell will officiate the Millennium Marriage Ceremony at the
Pennsylvania Convention Center, where 1,000 couples will exchange
wedding vows. For partiers with cast-iron stomachs, the convention
center will host a scrapple breakfast at 5 a.m. on New Year's Day.
215-686-2000 or www.millennium
</P>
<P>
   .philadelphia.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  San Francisco. Stretching from the Golden Gate Bridge to the
Embarcadero to Market Street, San Francisco's New Year's Eve 1999
party promises to be lively and diverse. At the Superior Bash at
the Bill Graham Civic Center, separate party rooms will evoke the
moods of the city's myriad nightclubs, with music from swing to
disco. Conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco
Symphony will ring in the new year with a concert at Davies
Symphony Hall, featuring Broadway star Audra McDonald and
mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade. The world's largest martini
glass lights up the Westin St. Francis hotel in Union Square; at
midnight, a giant olive will drop into the glass, with a fireworks
display to follow. 415-391-2000 or www.sfvisitor.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Washington. Top names in movies, sports and music will descend
on the U.S. capital for the three-day America's Millennium party on
the National Mall. Produced by Quincy Jones, the celebration
includes performances by the Supremes and the Grateful Dead, a
light and laser show and a short film directed by Steven Spielberg
and narrated by President Clinton. Also, the Smithsonian
Institution will sponsor educational shows, including an appearance
by several astronauts. 1-888-294-2100.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORLD
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  London. If the rest of the world is excited about Y2K, London
is positively delirious. The city is building numerous colossal
monuments to celebrate the occasion, including the Millennium Dome,
a massive arena (more than one-half mile in circumference) with a
translucent fiberglass and Teflon roof; and the Millennium Wheel,
the world's largest Ferris wheel, 500 feet in diameter. Ground zero
for the festivities is Greenwich. Known as the Prime Meridian of
the World, the borough marks the spot where official recorded time
is measured. That means it will be the first place, by the clock,
to greet the new year. 1-800-462-2748 or www.visitbritain.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Paris. The City of Light should be extra sparkly come Dec. 31.
A few minutes before midnight, a giant luminous egg will descend
from the Eiffel Tower. When it reaches the ground at the stroke of
12, it will crack open to reveal giant television screens playing
live feeds from millennium parties across the globe. There are also
plans to float 2,000 decorative plastic fish in the Seine and to
build a 650-foot wooden tower that will house bars and restaurants.
1-410-286-8310 or www.francetourism.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rome. Christened the Great Jubilee by Pope John Paul II,
Rome's Y2K celebration should draw hundreds of thousands of
Christians. The pope will usher in the third millennium of
Christianity by knocking on the door of St. Peter's Basilica with a
silver hammer. The Vatican is also building 50 churches in honor of
the occasion, including the Church of the Year 2000, which
resembles the Sydney Opera House. 212-245-4822 or
www.piuitalia2000.it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Holy Land. Not surprisingly, the birthplace of Christ is
celebrating 2000 with many momentous events. Most suited to the
spirit of the occasion: the Millennium Great Embrace, in which more
than 100,000 people, including Israelis, Jordanians and
Palestinians, will join hands to form a human circle around the
Dead Sea. Other events in-
</P>
<P>
   clude prayer vigils in Bethlehem and Nazareth and a candlelight
procession in Jerusalem. 1-888-774-7732 or www.goisrael.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New Zealand. According to the Royal Geographical Society of
London, New Zealand's easternmost territory, Pitt Island, will be
the first inhabited place to see the sunrise on Jan. 1. Inhabitants
are besieged with calls from people interested in coming to witness
the event, but Pitt has no hotels or restaurants. Fans of historic
moments needn't fret _ organizers plan to televise the sunrise. On
the mainland, the city of Hamilton hosts the Millennium Marathon on
Jan. 1. Runners will navigate a course alongside the scenic Waikato

MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST GAY MARRIAGES, POLLS FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly two-thirds of California voters support a
March 2000 ballot measure that would outlaw gay marriage,
suggesting an uphill battle for initiative opponents, according a
poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted by the Public Policy Institute of
California, a nonpartisan think tank in San Francisco, showed that
63 percent of likely state voters support the measure, while 34
percent oppose it. Only 3 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Baldassare, a senior fellow at the institute, said the
early advantage the initiative enjoys could reflect how little
information voters have about the measure six months out from the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now people don't know much about who's backing the
initiative and why they're backing it, and who's against the
initiative and why they're against it,'' Baldassare said. ``Once
you have information like that in front of the voters, their
opinions can change _ in one direction or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the early support for the initiative, the survey found
California voters are deeply divided over other rights, such as
domestic partners benefits for gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the ballot initiative said the poll proved that
Californians are against gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very positive indication that the electorate wants
marriage defined as it always has been defined,'' said Rob
Stutzman, spokesman for the Protection of Marriage Committee.
</P>
<P>
   California family law defines marriage as between a man and a
woman. The measure would go a step further by adding a clause that
says only heterosexual marriages can be valid and recognized by the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters believe the new language could help ensure that
California never recognizes gay marriages, even if courts in the
future rule that same-sex marriages are constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say the measure is simply a mean-spirited attack
on gays and lesbians. And because state law already defines
marriages as between a man and a woman, they say the initiative
also is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to stop gay marriage because there is no gay
marriage,'' said Mike Marshall, who manages a campaign against the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said the initiative is the first step by religious
conservatives to take away other rights from gays and lesbians,
such as the right to adopt children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once voters begin to focus on that, I'm confident they will
vote to defeat it,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Alaska and Hawaii have in recent years passed bans on
gay marriage similar to that slated for California's March 2000
ballot, although initiative backers expect a tougher fight here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the opposition to be true to their word in raising
$5 million to $10 million'' for the campaign, Stutzman said.
``Money in campaigns can move poll numbers in California.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found divided views among Californians on several
other issues involving gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow majority _ 51 percent _ of likely voters believe
companies should be required to provide health insurance and other
domestic benefits for partners of gays and lesbians, while 43
percent oppose requiring such benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the government's efforts to protect gays and
lesbians, 34 percent of likely voters said the government had done
``too little,'' 30 percent said ``the right amount'' and 30 percent
said the government had done ``too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted Aug. 26 to Sept. 3, surveyed 989 likely
voters. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.5 percentage
points.

   FIELD _ In the movie ``Field of Dreams'' the ghost of Shoeless
Joe Jackson emerges from a stand of corn and asks: ``Is this
Heaven?'' No such luck, Costner responds. But in the end the film
implies that the hereafter would have a hard time beating foul
lines stretching into a Midwestern cornfield. Fans charmed by the
movie's romance with baseball and farm life have come here ever
since, chasing ground balls and nostalgia on base paths. But this
piece of Iowa is Heaven no more. The field's caretakers _ Becky and
Don Lansing own the most of the infield and right field, Rita and
Al Ameskamp hold deed to left and center fields _ can't seem to get
along. In a conflict perhaps as American as the game the field
celebrates, the Lansings and Ameskamps peddle souvenirs out of
competing shacks and regularly settle scores at county zoning panel
meetings. ``It's a shame,'' said Don Lansing. ``It takes away from
the field and the fun for the fans.'' Scott Canon. 32. Photos.

percentage of students who scored at the proficient or advanced
levels either declined or remained flat. Graphic. Phil O'Connor.

sturdier and safer school buses. Some Kansas City area school

WOMEN BEHAVING MADLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether you believe it begins in 2000 or 2001, the 21st century
is mere months away. When it comes to marriage, though, certain
movies have a mentality that, although not exactly 19th-century, is
more backward than forward. We continually meet smart, attractive,
professional women who, these movies argue, believe that they
aren't complete until they have a man for keeps.
</P>
<P>
   The latest entry in this genre is ``Love Stinks,'' which
proposes that tall, beautiful interior decorator Chelsea (Bridgette
Wilson) would not only fall instantly for goofily charming sitcom
writer Seth (French Stewart), but would want to marry him within
minutes, and then would take the desire to psychotic levels.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see a portrait of a total lack of dignity, study
Wilson's performance here, which consists of showing off the goods
while spouting demeaning dialogue. Her low point comes when Chelsea
charges out onto a beach, clad only in her lingerie, and throws an
expensive birthday gift into the ocean because it's not the
engagement ring that she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But Chelsea isn't the most sexist character here; that honor
would have to go to her best friend Holly (Tyra Banks), who blindly
sides with Chelsea in her battle to net Seth. What Holly should be
doing is organizing an intervention for her loony pal. Holly's
husband, Larry (MTV's Bill Bellamy), has a little more sense, but
he also sides with Seth a little too quickly. Writer-director Jeff
Franklin (who, like Seth, is a sitcom writer) is so intent on
constructing a Nora Ephron-style battle of the sexes that he paints
his characters as caricatures rather than people.
</P>
<P>
   Objections to political incorrectness aside, ``Love Stinks''
could have worked better. There's a germ of a sharp idea in here,
and the movie could have been a send-up of self-help books such as
``Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus'' and ``The Rules.'' The
movie does get marginally better as Chelsea and Seth's relationship
disintegrates and they engage in a war of pranks, but this kind of
stuff was done to much better effect in ``War of the Roses'' and
``The Ref.'' Franklin relies too much on easy laugh-getters such as
flatulence and crotch-kick gags, but at least he does provide his
half-baked script with a fairly satisfying wrap-up.
</P>
<P>
   But you know a movie's in trouble when its peripheral stories
work better than its main plot. ``Seinfeld'' semi-regular Steve
Hytner is amusing in a small role as Seth's completely amoral
agent, and the movie's view of Seth's sitcom has a satirical edge,
including a well-turned shot at NBC, home of Stewart's own sitcom,
``3rd Rock From the Sun.'' Whenever we see this
sitcom-within-the-movie, we see TV execs contributing forced
laughter to boost the sitcom's lame jokes. It's easy to imagine
that the same things went on behind the scenes on ``Love Stinks.''

CHAOS SURROUNDS SAN FRANCISCO MAYORAL DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ILENE LELCHUK and RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown launched a
counterattack to a verbal beating he took last week, but his two
chief opponents didn't let up their joint assault on the incumbent
during the election season's second, and more raucous, mayoral
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Chaos in the crowd upstaged Brown, Clint Reilly and former Mayor
Frank Jordan throughout Wednesday night's event, during which 12
demonstrators were ejected from the auditorium, arrested and cited
by police.
</P>
<P>
   The rowdy audience cheered, booed, blew whistles and stomped
feet as candidates tried to answer questions. The candidates
couldn't hear each other, and the crowd couldn't hear them.
</P>
<P>
   The event continued to set the tone for what is turning out to
be an increasingly acrimonious battle leading up to the Nov. 2
election.
</P>
<P>
   None of the candidates was happy after the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly blamed Brown for packing the auditorium with disrupters
and he criticized the format, saying ``leaders of a debate have to
keep people in line.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Holli Thier, co-president of the League of Women Voters,
which co-sponsored the debate, said Wednesday night was about
democracy in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that tonight we saw very active citizens
participating in government,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic Chamber of Commerce also co-sponsored the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's questions asked by media panelists and one senior
from Mission High School _ site of the debate _ focused on
affordable housing, safe streets and public transit. But Brown
still managed a few jabs at what he called the ``Jordan-Reilly''
years.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly ran Jordan's losing re-election campaign against Brown
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' gloves came off when asked about the connection
between money and power at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Brown especially zeroed in on Reilly's record as a former
campaign consultant ``who regularly took money from anyone who
would give it to him,'' particularly the insurance industry when he
earned millions of dollars running its campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also pointed out that Reilly and Jordan have been dinged
by the state Fair Political Practices Commission for campaign
finance improprieties during past elections. Reilly also was fined
by the city's Ethics Commission during this election cycle for
improper campaign finance reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've both been nailed and they both have jackets,'' Brown
said. The word ``jackets'' refers to the folders that hold a
person's legal records.
</P>
<P>
   Brown added quickly, ``But I don't want to talk about those
issues,'' moving back to his promise to stick to the issues rather
than personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Reilly, however, continued to pound Brown with
allegations of corruption. And Reilly linked Brown with District
Attorney Terence Hallinan, who's been in the hot seat over his
office's relatively low conviction rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brown-Hallinan team systematically is destroying our
quality of life,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after a newspaper reported Hallinan's dismal
conviction rate, Brown came out in staunch defense of the district
attorney and highlighted the city's 40 percent crime rate drop
since he's been in office.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also were asked how they would avoid the
influence of special interest money.
</P>
<P>
   ``As mayor of this city, I have been scrupulously obedient of
the rules,'' said Brown, who is under attack by his opponents for
what they call his entrenched cronyism and the ongoing FBI probe
into contracting under his administration.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in the first debate, Reilly called Brown's ``the most
corrupt administration in history,'' sounding a familiar tune of
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan attacked both Reilly and Brown on ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man wants to sell City Hall,'' Jordan said, pointing to
Brown. And pointing to Reilly, he added, ``And this man wants to
buy City Hall,'' referring to Reilly's huge campaign war chest _
mainly self-financed _ of $1.3 million as of last month. Jordan
pledged he would spend no more than $600,000.

`BEST LAID PLANS' SHORT ON SUSPENSE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ``Best Laid Plans'' is a suspense thriller where the scenery is
more interesting than either the characters or the story. That's
good news if you're a fan of production design, but less satisfying
for those looking for some tension to go with the terrain. Director
Mike Barker, a Brit making his U.S. feature film debut, tries to
keep his audience distracted with an abundance of camera movement,
but, ultimately, all the activity can't disguise the story's
shortage of suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the movie's first 10 minutes unfold: Two old college
buddies, Bryce (Josh Brolin) and Nick (Alessandro Nivola),
reminisce in a dive bar in the desolate town of Tropico. Patsy
Cline plays on the jukebox; whiskey flows from the bartender. When
Nick leaves to fetch another round, Bryce finds himself in direct
eye contact with an alluring young woman, Lissa (Reese
Witherspoon). She joins the party; Nick, thinking three's a crowd,
calls it a night.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the wee, small hours of the morning, Nick's phone
rings. It's Bryce. There's a problem. Lissa returned home with
Bryce, one thing led to another, and now she's crying rape.
</P>
<P>
   That would be bad enough, but a cursory look through Lissa's
purse reveals two fake IDs. She's clearly underage. And that's why
Bryce dragged her down to the basement and handcuffed her to a
drainpipe. He needs time to think. And he needs Nick's help.
</P>
<P>
   With its early noirish touches and plot-heavy opening sequence,
you know it's a pretty good bet that you can't believe much of what
you're seeing here. And sure enough, ``Best Laid Plans'' promptly
transports us four months back in time, slowly revealing various
motives and mysteries. Many of them are sort of interesting; few,
though, are genuinely compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Bryce and Nick enjoy a sort of forced chuminess, undercut by the
bitterness Nick harbors toward his friend, and more than that, life
itself. It's hard to blame him, seeing some of the burdens life
tosses his way. And Bryce is a real pip, a rich kid who never lost
his sense of entitlement, a grown man who feels like the victim
even when he has a girl chained in his basement.
</P>
<P>
   Looming in the background as all this unspools is Tropico, a
suffocating town where we never see people walking its streets or
driving its roads. It's Deadsville, reminiscent of the Red Rock,
Wyo., in John Dahl's much superior ``Red Rock West.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``Best Laid Plans'' was shot in Bakersfield is probably a
fact that its chamber of commerce will ignore in future brochures.
As eerily designed by Sophie Becher, this is one town that screams
for you to pack your bags and leave.
</P>
<P>
   If Ted Griffin's screenplay had evoked as much tension as
Becher's claustrophobic production work, ``Best Laid Plans'' could
have been elevated above the level of a serviceable thriller.
(Griffin does deserve some credit, since this movie certainly
improves on his first effort, ``Ravenous.'') The acting is fine,
although the talented Witherspoon is largely wasted in a role that
subordinates her to the male leads and, yes, the smothering charms
of Tropico, U.S.A. &QL;

QUESTIONS OF FAITH, QUESTIONS OF TRUTH

<P>
   If you can filter through the garish cinematic flourishes and
occasionally numbing pacing of music video/commercial director
Rupert Wainwright's new supernatural thriller ``Stigmata,'' you'll
find a fascinatingly original spin on the old ``Exorcist''/''Omen''
school of demon possession.
</P>
<P>
   Count on the Catholic Church being none too pleased, of course.
One shudders to think what Old Hollywood's Legion of Decency would
make of Wainwright's shocking accusations about biblical history
and church practices _ even if they are thinly veiled as fiction.
It's sure to get quite a few of the faithful hot under the collar,
at least until Kevin Smith's ``dogma'' hits theaters later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers on a branch of the Vatican that investigates
(and usually disproves) reported miracles _ think of it as a
Catholic X-Files. Gabriel Byrne is Father Kiernan, a religious
scientist (and don't think he isn't aware of the oxymoronic
undertones there) sent to investigate a 23-year-old supposed
stigmatic named Frankie (Patricia Arquette).
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is, the happy-go-lucky hairdresser by day, club
kid by night claims she doesn't even believe in God. When Frankie
begins developing signs of stigmata _ marks resembling Jesus'
crucifixion wounds, usually experienced only by the devout _ the
doubtful Father Kiernan gradually makes the leap from Scully-like
skepticism to Mulder-like belief.
</P>
<P>
   But as Kiernan begins investigating Frankie's proclivity for
speaking and writing in a language unused for 1,900 years, he
stumbles upon something his superiors (led by the delightfully
sinister Jonathan Pryce) want silenced ... permanently.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot more twists and turns to the story, but
revealing any more would give away the goods _ so beware of gabby
reviewers and TV entertainment magazines if you're looking forward
to this one.
</P>
<P>
   Director Wainwright seems awfully enamored of headache-inducing,
quick-cut editing and a throbbingly loud soundtrack (with music by
Smashing Pumpkin Billy Corgan, no less), and his artsy overkill
threatens to reduce the film to an overlong, blasphemous MTV Buzz
Clip.
</P>
<P>
   But the story shines when it deals with menacing inner workings
at Vatican City and the efforts of a dark syndicate within the
church to protect its faithful minions from something more
threatening than sin ... the truth.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, Chris Carter is already working on a pilot for
Fox.

MCLAREN IS HAPPY TO FINALLY BEAT THE AWES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Mass. _ He is only 22, but it seems as if he's been
around forever.
</P>
<P>
   OK, not all that long. Defenseman Kyle McLaren is just starting
his fifth season in the National Hockey League so he's had plenty
of time to get comfortable. Or has he? McLaren confessed that even
though he played side by side with Bruins captain Ray Bourque for
the better part of his first two seasons, it took him three before
he felt comfortable around the future Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intimidation factor . . . I mean, you look at him and it's
Ray Bourque,'' said McLaren, still sounding awestruck. ``I was
still intimidated after three years. It's amazing even now to be
able to play with him still. He's played (going on) 21 years. This
is my fifth year and I'm still amazed by him.''
</P>
<P>
   That first couple of seasons, McLaren said he had no problem
adapting to Bourque on the ice. When the rookie would make a
mistake, Bourque would help him recover. When McLaren earned more
playing time, Bourque guided him through the responsibility.
McLaren said he wasn't quite ready for any more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to know him on the ice a little bit. But when you're
playing next to a legend, it's really tough,'' he said. ``It's
almost like playing with Bobby Orr. I know they're two different
guys, but they're two legends of the game. I knew him on the ice
but off the ice, that's the problem I had trouble with, just
sitting there in the locker room or going to lunches. I just
couldn't do it. I never really talked to him about it. I'm sure if
I talked to him now, he'd joke about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'm not the first one to say this. I'm sure there are
guys who leave here and say, `I still couldn't talk to him.' That's
one thing I wanted to change last year and this year, is to have
more communication with the guys I play with.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Bruins defenseman Gord Kluzak, who played and became
friends with Bourque, said he understands what McLaren went But by
the same token, he said McLaren needed to grow into himself, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be less Ray and more Kyle sort of maturing and starting
to talk to other people and seek advice and friendship,'' said
Kluzak. ``Ray is not somebody who really goes and initiates. It
might have taken Kyle time to get comfortable with himself. And
they're different generations. He takes a real interest personally
in people like Kyle. Obviously he wants to see (McLaren) do very
well, but he knows he needs some guidance. He has been more than
willing to provide that but Kyle has to be sort of ready for it,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren, partly during the playoffs and definitely over the
summer, began conquering his awe and even spent the offseason
working out with Bourque and defenseman Don Sweeney. McLaren
adapted some training habits and revamped his diet, and now says he
feels great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working out with Donny, you know how intense he is, it helped
me,'' he said. ``I ran with him in the mornings and then worked out
with him and we were done by noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``From last year in the playoffs, I'm up 15 pounds. I was down
to 212 in the playoffs. I weighed myself in camp and I was up to
233. I was playing 30 minutes a game in the playoffs so I knew I
was losing it and I couldn't eat because I was too tired. I think
it affected my play a little bit. Not so where you can say, `Geez,
he's playing terrible.' I was getting tired a lot faster and I
couldn't sleep, but I think it had a lot had to do with not eating
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said he eats smaller meals and uses nutritional
supplements. His big goal this season is to stay injury free, which
isn't as easy as it sounds considering the physical nature of the
way McLaren plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could care less about points and stuff like that,'' he said.
``I think if I stay healthy, I can help this team a lot. I believe
my points can be up there. I've been unfortunate in that I've had
an injury almost every single year or a holdout. I want to stay
healthy. Injuries happen and they're a part of the game, but I've
been unfortunate to really be stricken by that bug. If I stay
healthy, I believe I can pass my point total from last year and
have more ice time than usual. As long as the team is winning,
that's my main goal.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren was limited to 52 games last season because of a
contract holdout and injuries, but still contributed six goals and
18 assists. He also had three assists in 12 playoff games. He
doesn't think he'll ever be a prolific scorer, but he does believe
he can contribute more.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game isn't to go end to end and score,'' he said. ``My game
is to go end to end, but run everyone over that I can. That's my
job and I know how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing so many games, McLaren said his career has flown
thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really don't know how fast time goes,'' he said. ``I still
can't believe I'm going into my fifth year and I'm only 22. I feel
old. I shouldn't say that too loud, but I do. I feel old. I look at
all the young players and the new faces around the team and it's
like, `Where did everybody go?' Everybody changes every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little encouraging for myself to know I've been here
for five years and I made it at 18 and I got lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   Forward Cameron Mann suffered a broken nose after being struck
by a stick in Tuesday's practice and missed Wednesday's workout.
He's expected to be out a couple of days . . . Coach Pat Burns, who
throws around compliments like manhole covers, said he was
impressed with the players' overall fitness. ``They're in the best
shape I've seen in the three years I've been here,'' said Burns.
``The weights are down and the strength is up.'' . . . One problem
area the Bruins have right now is at center, considering the loss
of Tim Taylor to free agency and Jason Allison's ankle injury.
``It's very scary,'' said Burns. ``It's a scary fact.''

WITH THE MEDIA, BILL PARCELLS HAS BUILT A SOLID GAME PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ You are not surprised. You know that there
are people here who cannot shake themselves free of Bill Parcells.
They wonder what he is saying and doing in New York. They talk
about him constantly. They are revelers, truly fascinated with a
man whose given name is ``Duane'' but who is often called ``Tuna.''
</P>
<P>
   Who are these people? Well, most of them do not play for the New
England Patriots. Some will watch Sunday's Pats-Jets game from high
atop Giants Stadium. They will then submit reports that will be
published in newspapers or broadcast over television and radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
   I am talking about members of my profession and, yes, I am
guilty. The dynamics of the Tuna War have changed, yet many of us
still act as if it were General Parcells _ and not Julius Caesar _
who led his Roman soldiers over the Rubicon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong, the guy did some great things while he was
here,'' Bruce Armstrong said Wednesday. ``But the stories have
reached mythic proportions. He has a strong personality, but now
it's almost like he's become a legendary figure. I don't look at it
that way. I was here; I remember. I was here when he went something
like 6-10 in his third season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That same year, you guys and the fans were saying that the
game had passed him by. Same thing in '96 when we started 0-2 and
went to the Super Bowl. Now he's a legend. I understand: There's no
revisionist historian like a sportswriter.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons Parcells is a media star, here and in New
York. He has a knack for saying things about sports that you would
only expect to hear from your most candid friends. If he wasn't
coaching, he'd be tailgating. He might even be commissioner of your
Fantasy League. He remembers names and voices well, too. During a
teleconference Wednesday, he called people by their first names
even though they hadn't identified themselves (if you have the
stature of a Parcells or Phil Jackson, you can quickly disarm
reporters by remembering their names).
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he knows what reporters are looking for. He
knows the difference between a columnist, feature writer, and beat
reporter. And since he has wit, occasional bombast, and an
understanding of this profession, he earns a reverence from the
media. He is Machiavelli with a clipboard, simultaneously respected
and feared. There is constant tension with him. No one wants to be
the poor bloke who becomes part of an infamous, Parcells Tirade
highlight.
</P>
<P>
   All of that factors into the coverage of Patriots-Jets, but has
little to do with the game itself. I think it is obvious, finally,
that the Pats and Pete Carroll understand Parcells's factor in
Sunday's game while many of us _ media and fans, that is _ do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not magic,'' Armstrong said. ``Parcells is not a
magician. When he has players, he wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The war many Patriots, media types, and fans were fighting in
'97 (Tuna Bowl I) has changed. Then, Parcells had a magical hold on
his former team the same way he has a hold on reporters. The same
was true last season. But the afternoon of Dec. 27 put things in
their proper perspective. Shortly after that date, a 31-10 Jets
victory, it became clear that there are two wars when it comes to
Pats-Jets. There is the blue-collar one that features 250-pound men
running into each other at full speed. And there is the
white-collar one that features a lot of talking, posturing, and
administrative finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of the Pats are like Armstrong, they know that they
only have to be concerned with one segment of the war. That's why
Armstrong sat at his Foxboro Stadium locker Wednesday, holding his
shoulder pads and talking football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that if we have our players, we're just as good or
better than any of the teams in our division,'' he said. He said he
was slightly amused that the Pats are being picked to finish so
poorly, even though they have made the playoffs the last two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong did not mention the compensatory draft picks the Pats
received when Parcells left. He didn't mention that some members of
the organization are concerned that Jets assistant coaches may be
contacting the Pats. He didn't mention it because that is not his
platoon. That type of fighting takes place between the men who do
not play the game. It took two years for the Pats to figure this
out, but they finally have it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's not to say they don't talk about their former boss.
They do. They all have reasons for wanting to knock his team around
a few times. Some of them wish they could do it to him, but as
Parcells said Wednesday, ``Hey, I'm not playing in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And Carroll? Well, he's starting to realize the benefits of
media spin. He answered very few strategy questions Wednesday. But
before he left Foxboro Stadium, he sounded like a guy making a 911
call from the ledge of a skyscraper. ``I'm a little dangerous right
now,'' the coach said. It is easily his most memorable quote. The
Pats like it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the Jets can get caught up in all this Tuna Bowl
stuff,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely. The Jets have one of the toughest schedules in the
league and they also happen to play in the league's toughest
division. They know what this division game means. The Pats know
what this division game means. They know Parcells's aura will not
beat them; giving up third-down receptions to Keyshawn Johnson and
Dedric Ward will. They know that. It seems that we in the news
business are the last to know.

 GE DENIES THAT PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER FROM PCBs  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DINA CAPPIELLO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ People are not in danger of getting sick from
PCBs in the upper Hudson River because no one is eating fish caught
there, according to the General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   GE's announcement came five weeks after the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency reported that consuming fish from the 40-mile
stretch of the Hudson between the Troy Dam and Hudson Falls is the
main way people are exposed to PCBs, raising the risk of cancer and
other human health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But in the latest counter-argument in the long-running dispute
over the river's cleanup, GE contended that risks associated with
fishing don't exist in the upper Hudson where commercial fishing
bans, health consumption advisories and catch-and-release rules
have existed since the 1970s, when the federal government banned
the use of PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a basic tenet of risk assessment that without exposure
there is no risk,'' said Stephen Ramsey, a GE vice president.
``People aren't eating fish'' from the upper Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   That contradicts a 1996 state Department of Health survey of 294
anglers. The department found that 11 percent to 18 percent of
fisherman in the upper Hudson had fish when interviewed, suggesting
that they may have planned to eat them, said spokeswoman Claire
Pospisil.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists maintain that people _ especially the poor and
immigrants _ still eat fish from the entire river despite the
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey dismissed these ``rumors'' and said they should not be
the basis for a major public policy decision on whether to remove
PCBs or allow the river to cleanse itself.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is expected to decide on a course of action by 2001.
Many environmentalists favor dredging ``hot spots'' downstream from
now-closed plants in Hudson Falls and Fort Edward where GE legally
discharged millions of gallons of PCBs from the 1940s to 1976.
</P>
<P>
   PCBs, which were used in an insulating fluid for electrical
equipment, are listed by the EPA as a probable human carcinogen,
based on research performed on laboratory rats in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   GE has repeatedly questioned the logic of such studies _
particularly those involving animals _ that conclude that PCBs are
harmful to humans.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, activists voiced concern about what they view as
the company's campaign to discredit EPA science.
</P>
<P>
   ``This underscores GE's consistent pattern of disinformation and
non-responsiveness to a known public health risk and threat,'' said
Aaron Mair of the Arbor Hill Environmental Justice Corp. ``It gives
people a false sense of security that the Hudson River is safe.''
</P>

   At a news conference Wednesday, Ramsey _ accompanied by several
other GE officials _ called the EPA's risk assessment
``fundamentally flawed'' and ``divorced from reality'' because it
ignored declining PCB levels in fish, studies conducted on workers
exposed to the chemicals and realistic consumption levels of fish.
The company requested an independent peer review of the EPA report.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which has planned to submit its finding to such an
independent review next spring, said it took into consideration PCB
levels in fish declining to the 2 parts per million Food and Drug
Administration limit.

BIOGRAPHY PROBES THE J.D. SALINGER MYSTERY

SALINGER 
A BIOGRAPHY 
By Paul Alexander 
Renaissance Books, 351 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's difficult not to feel a pang of sympathy for J. D.
Salinger, hounded by fans, would-be soulmates, reporters, stalked
by assorted crazies. The man only wants to be left alone. Or does
he?
</P>
<P>
   In ``Salinger: A Biography,'' Paul Alexander makes the original
suggestion that the publicity-shy author of ``The Catcher in the
Rye'' may in fact be ``the Greta Garbo of literature,'' a genius
spin doctor of his own legend who re-surfaces periodically to
remind the public that he wants to be left alone, thus calling
attention to himself and his work.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like the Garbo theory, Alexander has another to
explain the author's famous reclusiveness. He suggests Salinger has
hidden away from the world to keep secret his ``penchant'' for very
young women.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander seems just a little too fascinated by Salinger's
alleged interest in pubescent girls, calling it ``one of the
defining qualities'' of the author's life and work. The Salinger he
presents is a man who deliberately never grew up, a perpetual
Holden Caulfield. In fact, if you believe Alexander, Salinger
thinks he is Holden Caulfield, the alienated, cynical, fictional
teenager of his own invention. After suffering a nervous breakdown
at the end of his Army service in World War II, Salinger has ``had
trouble drawing distinctions between himself and his creations,
between his creations and the real people around him.'' Or so
Alexander claims.
</P>
<P>
   True? Who knows? The above conjectures and others are based on
the slimmest of evidence, or no evidence at all. Consider the
theory about Salinger's ``penchant'' for very young women. It's
true young girls figure in his fiction. It's also true that the
author, now 80, has been involved romantically with a number of
much younger women over the years. But no one, Alexander included,
has any proof he's a Humbert Humbert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salinger: A Biography'' was released with a minimum of
fanfare, probably because the publisher feared Salinger might sue
to prevent its publication. In 1986 the author sucessfully
challenged biographer Ian Hamilton's right to quote from his
letters, forcing Hamilton to make major alterations in his book,
eventually published as ``In Search of J. D. Salinger,'' an account
of his struggle to produce a biography.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder speculations aside, this probably is as good a biography
of Salinger as we're likely to get for a while. Alexander, who has
written biographies of Sylvia Plath and James Dean, interviewed
dozens of people who've known the author, and dug up information in
libraries and literary archives. He's succeeded in placing Salinger
in the context of his times, and in finding in the author's life
seeds of inspiration for his fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonny'' Salinger was by all accounts an unremarkable young
person until, while a student at Valley Forge Military Academy, he
began writing stories. His passion for writing turned singleminded
when he attended Ursinus College in Pennsylvania. He quit after
nine weeks, telling a classmate, ``I've got to be a writer.'' He
enrolled in a writing course at Columbia University and within
months his stories were appearing in magazines. By 1950 Salinger
was acknowledged as one of the country's best writers of short
stories. Fame came the following year, with the publication of
``The Catcher in the Rye.'' Salinger disliked all the attention,
and asked that his photograph be removed from the dust jacket. In
1953 he moved to Cornish, N.H., where he's been lying low ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander chronicles Salinger's seemingly endless conflicts with
editors, agents, and publishers, as well as his encounters with the
press. Salinger has given a few brief interviews over the last 40
years, most of them the results of having been accosted near his
home. His love life doesn't seem particularly kinky by the
standards of famous men: He's been married three times, and has had
a number of love affairs. For a while he had the habit of falling
for actresses he saw on television and asking them for dates. As we
know from her memoir ``At Home in the World,'' he employed a
similar modus operandi when he courted Joyce Maynard, then 18 to
his 54, after seeing her photograph in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander doesn't dwell on Salinger's longtime interest in Zen
Buddhism. If he is committed to that religion, it could explain his
reclusiveness. But why does it have to be explained? Considering
the toll fame so often takes on the famous, Salinger's desire for
privacy seems saner than the public's desire to know the details of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Is Salinger still writing? Has he been writing all these years?
It's been 35 years since he published anything new. In 1986, in a
deposition in the Ian Hamilton matter, Salinger testified that he
was writing ``a work of fiction.'' Others _ Maynard, his former
wife Claire, a neighbor _ have said he writes every day. Will we
ever read any of it? Your guess is as good as Alexander's. The only
thing that seems certain is that there will be more books about the
elusive and fascinating Salinger. Coming soon to a bookstore near
you: a memoir by his daughter.

ADD `ECHOES' TO RECENT LIST OF QUALITY HORROR FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The well-made horror trend continues with ``Stir
of Echoes.'' Solid characters, coherent storytelling and a number
of good jolts mark this second directing effort from David Koepp,
Hollywood's screenwriter du jour of the mid-'90s. He's growing into
a much more interesting filmmaker than those ``Jurassic Park''
scripts would have indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a lesser-known book by genre writer Richard Matheson,
``Echoes'' tells a more predictable ghost story than ``The Sixth
Sense'' and is certainly conventional, even old-fashioned, compared
to ``The Blair Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   But it bothers to do things that few horror films even think of,
like portraying working-class life in detail or examining the
fallout a haunting might really have on family relationships. It
even has a persuasive sense of setting and how the people who live
there would probably act _ and react to a growing nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Along with that, performances are consistently excellent. Kevin
Bacon strikes another new chord in his unassuming but increasingly
impressive career as Tom Witzky, a telephone lineman and
once-aspiring rock musician whose dreams have been
not-so-unpleasantly detoured by loving wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe)
and their adorable 6-year-old son Jake (Zachary David Cope). He's
not very educated but not exactly dumb, and his main frustration in
life _ at the film's outset, anyway _ is that his is so ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   As you might imagine, a careful-what-you-wish-for lesson is
right around the corner. The Witzkys recently moved into an
under-the-El-tracks, blue-collar Chicago neighborhood, where they
live in a just-restored (but still crummy) row house that
apparently has a history. And little Jake, like the ``Sixth Sense''
kid, has made a new, imaginary friend there who may not live just
in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Once sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana Douglas) hypnotizes Tom at a
party, he starts hearing and seeing things, too; violent, horrible,
incomprehensible things that slowly drive him nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Tom's headachey, obsessive descent is accompanied by insular
bonding with Jake who, though less dramatically, is also sensitive
to the spirit world. This leaves Maggie not only a crazy husband to
deal with, but a growing feeling of isolation from both of the guys
she loves.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the psychic intrusions grow more alarming, they
also grow more credible. It doesn't take too much brain work to
figure out that someone _ or something _ wants a terrible crime
resolved. You may guess what it is, but you should nonetheless
appreciate the meticulous care with which it's laid out.
</P>
<P>
   Though the movie contains its share of flashy, freaky visuals,
Koepp always keeps the focus on the human element, while clues to
the supernatural mystery are doled out at a leisurely but still
unnerving pace Although it's definitely third among the late
summer's spooky trinity, ``Stir of Echoes'' earns its place beside
Willis and the Witch. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The film: ``Stir of Echoes'' (R; violence, language, drug use, sex,
nudity). &QL; 
The stars: Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Zachary David Cope, Illeana
Douglas, Kevin Dunn. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by David Koepp. Written by Koepp, based
on Richard Matheson's novel. Produced by Gavin Polone and Judy
Hofflund. Released by Artisan Entertainment. &QL; 
Running time: One hour, 39 minutes. &QL;

COOKIES POSE A NEW THREAT TO PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two quarters you handed over for this paper won't cover my
salary. It's the advertisements that really pay the freight at a
newspaper. So I'm sympathetic to Internet companies looking for new
ways to earn ad revenues for their Web sites. Still, one must draw
a line somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite technology news Web sites is marred by a
series of wretched ads for some benighted electronics firm. The ads
feature dismal-looking women displayed in what are supposed to be
come-hither poses.
</P>
<P>
   Weary of wincing at the sight of them, I downloaded free
software (Windows and Unix only) to solve the problem. Internet
Junkbuster (www.junkbuster.com) can filter out many on-line
annoyances. It's not as simple to use as commercial filtering
products like SurfWatch or Cyber Patrol, but the price was
unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   Having installed the Junkbuster, it was easy to block unwanted
ads. By clicking on one of them with the right-side mouse button,
and then clicking on the word ``properties,'' I got the Web address
of the ads. By typing this into Junkbuster, I ensured that the
nasty images would trouble me no more. All I see is a blank space
where the grimy photos used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Other ads on the page are not affected. But after chatting with
Jason Catlett, creator of Internet Junkbuster, I began wondering if
I should block many more ads. It's not the photos that trouble me _
it's the cookies.
</P>
<P>
   You remember cookies _ the little bits of data left on your hard
drive by some of the Web sites you visit. Cookies enable you to log
on to many sites only once. Next visit, the site finds the cookie
on your hard drive and logs you in. Cookies make Web surfing
simpler, but Catlett sees them as a threat to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   I generally scoff at such paranoia. Cookies can only be read by
the company that gave them to you, and they only contain personal
data if you provide it. For instance, Yahoo's cookie identifies me
because I willingly gave the information to Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   But Catlett warned me that it's not that simple any more.
Consider firms like DoubleClick Inc. and 24/7 Media Inc. These are
firms that display many of the ads you see on popular Web sites.
These sites put cookies on your computer whenever they flash an ad
on your screen. These cookies are checked whenever you visit
another site with a DoubleClick or 24/7 ad. The ad company now
knows which sites you've visited and which ads you've seen. That
helps them decide which ad to show you the next time you visit a
site.
</P>
<P>
   This is old news. And in its original form, it posed no threat
to privacy, because the advertiser's cookies identified you as a
number. DoubleClick or 24/7 didn't know your name, address, phone
number, or e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   But soon they will. Ever buy a product and register it over the
Internet? Then there's a good chance your name and address are on
file with 24/7. The firm has an arrangement with Intelliquest
Information Group Inc., the company that handles most on-line
registrations. Intelliquest puts a cookie on your computer when you
register your latest purchase. Then the company shares the cookie
and your personal data with 24/7. Starting early next year,
whenever you visit a Web site with a 24/7 ad, the company will know
you're there. Visit enough 24/7 sites, and the firm can compile a
dossier on your comings and goings. DoubleClick plans to introduce
a similar feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gives us the ability to profile groups of people,''
says 24/7 chief executive David Moore, ``so we're showing diaper
ads to women and, say, football ads to men.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore says consumers must grant permission for his firm to
create a profile. He said users can contact 24/7 and have their
names removed from the database. Moore said 24/7 will not sell data
to other firms. Besides, he added, ``the folks who have really
strong feelings about privacy are few and far between.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm one of them. Maybe 24/7 will behave itself, but we have only
its word for it. European nations have data privacy laws. But in
America, firms can pretty much do as they like.
</P>
<P>
   Firms like 24/7 and DoubleClick think they can make millions
from consumers' personal data. Well, they'll get no help from me.
I've contacted both companies and opted out of their databases. If
I were really paranoid, I'd use Internet Junkbuster to block all
ads sent from the two companies. But I won't. After all, these guys
have to make a living too.

DOES FORBES STAND A CHANCE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, N.H. _ To put it gently, it takes imagination to see
Steve Forbes in the Oval Office. He doesn't have Ronald Reagan's
easygoing glamour or Bill Clinton's gifts of empathy and rhetoric.
He lacks the bearing of a natural commander. He has never held
serious political office. And as of last weekend's Boston Globe
poll, he is supported by 7 percent of New Hampshire voters, less
than John McCain (12 percent), Elizabeth Dole (14), and George W.
Bush (44).
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has heard it all before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at past presidents,'' he says, taking a break after
marching in Milford's Columbus Day parade. ``Initially people
couldn't see them becoming president. Harry Truman. JFK _ too
young. Jimmy Carter. Nixon after '62. Ronald Reagan _ even in '79,
east of the Mississippi it was considered inconceivable that this
guy could become president. Once you wear the mantle, people think,
`Oh, of course.' But before? You look very human.''
</P>
<P>
   True, candidates often look far more viable after they've won
than they did before the votes were counted. And true, just because
something hasn't happened before, it doesn't mean it can't happen
now. Still, Americans have been electing presidents for 210 years,
and no one has ever vaulted from the world of business to the
presidency. With the exception of Wendell Willkie, a utilities
executive who ran against FDR in 1940, no corporate leader has even
won a major party's nomination. What makes him think he can
accomplish what no businessman in US history has accomplished?
</P>
<P>
   Forbes doesn't really answer the question. ``This country always
breaks precedents,'' he says, pointing out that before JFK defeated
Richard Nixon in 1960, it was axiomatic that no Catholic could win
the White House. He notes that some of the nation's most
influential presidents had meager political careers. ``Look at
Lincoln _ two years in Congress, two years in the state
Legislature. That's not the usual pattern. His predecessor, (James)
Buchanan'' _ an awful president _ ``had the more traditional
resume: a whole lifetime in appointed or elected office.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, ironclad political ``laws'' are sometimes broken.
There was the ancient jinx that kept sitting vice presidents from
winning the top job in their own right. Then came George Bush.
There was the hard-and-fast rule that you couldn't win the White
House unless you had won the New Hampshire primary. Then came Bill
Clinton. Maybe Forbes is going to prove that you don't need at
least some political experience _ or a brilliant military career _
to become president. But how?
</P>
<P>
   And how, for that matter, is he going to surmount another axiom
of modern presidential politics? Since at least 1968, the candidate
with the support of the GOP establishment has always gone on to win
the nomination. Reagan couldn't dislodge Gerald Ford, the
establishment candidate in 1976; four years later, when most party
leaders coalesced behind Reagan, Bush couldn't dislodge him. Bush,
in turn, easily fended off Bob Dole and Jack Kemp in 1988, and in
1996, when party mandarins decided it was Dole's ``turn,'' Pat
Buchanan and Forbes didn't stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   But never has the GOP establishment united in support of a
candidate as overwhelmingly as it has sworn fealty to George W.
Bush. Hundreds of elected Republicans have endorsed him, many sight
unseen; he has shattered every record for preprimary fund-raising;
he tops every Republican preference poll. Can Forbes compete
against that?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly not. But if he does make a real fight of it, it will be
by offering Republican voters the one important thing they won't
get from Bush: powerful Republican ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Forbes's call for drastically reforming the Internal
Revenue Code with a simple flat tax was widely and hotly debated.
He repeatedly championed medical savings accounts as a way to give
Americans more control over their own health care. He was the first
presidential candidate to suggest that workers be allowed to
channel their Social Security taxes into personal investment
accounts. Forbes's proposals were scorned by other GOP candidates
in 1996. Today they are mainstream Republican thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes argues that the Republican revolution in Congress failed
not because the GOP tried to do too much, but because it failed to
dare enough. During the pivotal 1995 budget fight with Clinton, he
recalls, ``our guys were going on TV and saying, `We demand
Congressional Budget Office-certified estimates for fiscal year
2003.' Wow! Now that's really the way to get people pumped.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's protectionist isolationism aside, the Forbes
operation is the only Republican presidential campaign in which
ideas are uppermost. The media obsess on Forbes's wealth, on the
high-tech whiz-bangery of his traveling road show, on his lavish
tent at the Iowa straw poll. What they fail to focus on is what
really distinguishes him from the rest of the field: Forbes is the
only candidate who is running for president because of his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   One belief above all. ``Genuine political freedom exists only
when the powers of the central government are limited, checked,
controlled, and balanced,'' Forbes writes in his new book. ``As our
federal government has grown too large and too powerful, the real
loss has been the freedom of people to govern their own lives and
participate fully in the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   There could hardly be a better premise for a Republican
presidential campaign.

SHAKEN BY `STIR': TAUT DIRECTION HELPS PULL OFF GHOST STORY DESPITE
MISSTEPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Timing is everything, and that applies to suspense as well as
comedy. When you're giving people the creeps, it's probably best to
never let them know exactly what's going on, but should you decide
to explain yourself, it's best to do it early (as in ``The Blair
Witch Project'') or late (as in ``The Sixth Sense''). Letting folks
off the hook in the middle can be a bad move.
</P>
<P>
   That ``Stir of Echoes,'' the new ghost story starring Kevin
Bacon, survives this tactical error is a tribute to the direction
of David Koepp, who also wrote the movie's screenplay. Koepp would
have done well to remove a scene in which someone explains why
Kevin Bacon's character is behaving in such a bizarre fashion, but
even with that extraneous piece of action, Koepp has delivered one
of the tautest, best-directed movies of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon plays Tom Witzky, a Chicago telephone repairman who's the
very definition of ``average guy.'' Tom has a wife and a young son,
and he goes to block parties and football games with a close-knit
bunch of neighbors. At one party, Tom's sister-in-law (Illeana
Douglas, acting witchy in more ways than one), begins blabbing
about hypnosis. Tom, a skeptic, volunteers to be a subject. Big
mistake. Turns out he's very receptive to hypnosis. After he goes
under, he begins seeing a lot of things that he doesn't want to
see, and he becomes obsessed with trying to figure them out.
</P>
<P>
   The movie doesn't wait for this scene to convince us that
something's up; the first shot, of the outside of Tom's house, is
somehow unnerving, and the ominousness continues when we meet Tom's
son, Jake, who's in the tub asking an invisible playmate if it
hurts to be dead. As Jake, 7-year-old Zachary David Cope is too
young to attain the intensity of Haley Joel Osment's performance in
``The Sixth Sense.'' But Koepp makes up for this by having Jake
address the camera directly, immediately bringing the audience into
the movie. The hypnosis scene also uses a theater motif that makes
you feel like you're sharing Tom's experience.
</P>
<P>
   For its first 45 minutes or so, the movie is tightly wound and
nerve-racking, running at a faster pace than the often lugubrious
``Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's mystery isn't all that hard to unravel, either, but
none of the film's setbacks prove fatal. Koepp lets you off the
hook just enough, wasting few scenes as the movie heads toward its
wrap-up. Bacon is convincingly distraught as the troubled father,
and James Newton Howard _ who also did the music for ``Sixth
Sense'' _ reins in his bombastic tendencies to come up with an
eerie soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, ``Stir of Echoes'' looks derivative, not just of
``Sixth Sense'' but of other movies as well, including ``The Dead
Zone,'' ``The Shining'' and ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind.''
But the movie isn't as derivative as it looks; it's based on a
41-year-old novel by Matheson, who influenced Stephen King and
wrote the script for Spielberg's breakthrough TV movie, ``Duel.''
``Stir of Echoes'' is more a matter of bringing things full circle,
and it's a worthy addition to the cinematic ghost-story pantheon.

   My friend Lynn gave this speech at a friend's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is mystery here. And magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Dawn and Scott's first date, Dawn knew that Scott was
the man she would marry. Mysteriously, during that dinner something
happened between them. Maybe it was fairy dust sprinkled on them _
or Cupid's arrow. Who can explain the mystery that is love? There
is no explanation, no because, no chain of reasons. It happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it keeps happening. The spark that lit on their first date
has grown into a steady flame that has warmed them and lit their
way. With Scott at her side and in her heart, Dawn is more
grounded, courageous, and confident. With Dawn at his side and in
his heart, Scott is more expressive, free, and playful. I picture
Scott securing Dawn to walk firmly on the ground. And I picture
Dawn floating Scott up to soaring flights of fancy and imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wendell Berry wrote: `The meaning of marriage begins in the
giving of words. We cannot join ourselves to one another without
giving our word.' We are all here to bear witness to this
transformative moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a moment of magic that will change their lives. When you
two say the words of your vows to each other, that will make all
the difference. These words will connect you for your lifetimes.
And a lifetime marriage is a work in process. Ask any old married
soul about how each individual grows and learns and changes. The
marriage reflects that, but the mystery and the magic remain _ that
you two have agreed to connect deeply, thoroughly and heartfully
through your entire lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are blessed to be with you today.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange of vows as a ``transformative moment''? A marriage
lasting a ``lifetime''? How old fashioned that sounds at a time
when fewer people are deciding to marry than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Men may have always been skittish about ``tying the knot,'' but
in a recent study at Rutgers, more than half of girls graduating
think that having a child, but not a husband, is a worthwhile
lifestyle. More than a third believe their own marriage will end in
divorce while 70 percent think it's possible to have a full life
without marrying. No wonder women are advised to view a career and
an independent income as an indispensable exit clause when the
honeymoon ends.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn and I may turn out to be members of the last generation
that actually believed that giving our word in marriage would
transform us and ensure our entry into a world where we'd be called
upon to be more responsible, nurturing, and unselfish than we'd
ever been before. It's not that the early, highly romantic,
let's-just-please-ourselves phase wasn't important. Jack and I
waited five years before having a child, but we agreed that
marriage required compromise. We were willing to sacrifice our own
wishes because we believed that our identity as a couple and a
family had a higher value than our independent, separate selves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, I married into a subordinate role. In 1975, in a second
ceremony after two years of conflict-filled couples' therapy, we
shifted to a more equal partnership. Yet, despite changes in form,
Jack and I never lost sight that our marriage and the family that
had emerged from it was a transcendent force in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Like Emerson's Over-Soul, our marriage was a third party in our
relationship, arching over us ``like a temple,'' creating a unity
of intention that embodied our noblest thoughts and aspirations.
Our best selves participated in that common endeavor; they were in
fact enriched by it. Having been married in the sight of God, we
believed marriage was the closest we could get to the sublime on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   That faith in something larger than our personal preferences got
us through some tough times. Like Dawn and Scott, Jack and I have
changed each other in a thousand ways, many of which did not seem
particularly appealing at the time. In working to maintain our
relationship, we were both pushed to move beyond what was
comfortable, or easy, or natural. The best I understand it, we
stood by each other in closeness and at arm's length, in love and
in hate, in passion and in fury, because we believed we were part
of something greater than ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Call it mystery and magic. You can even call it a pipe dream.
</P>
<P>
   May it never lose its power.

YELTSIN'S POWER TEETERS ATOP SPIRAL OF SCANDALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Eight years ago, Boris N. Yeltsin was the brave face of
Russian reform. Today, few here would be surprised to see his face
on a Most Wanted poster.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past month, Yeltsin's Kremlin has had to fend off
allegations ranging from money laundering to bribery to insider
trading _ allegations making headlines all over the world, with
Russia being called everything from a ``kleptocracy'' to a
``gangster state.'' Dmitri Yakushkin, the president's spokesman,
has likened the array of charges to ``an inquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the snowballing accusations are reaching all the way to
Yeltsin himself. Yuri Skuratov, who was suspended in March as
Russia's top prosecutor after investigating Kremlin corruption,
said on Tuesday that authorities in Switzerland are looking into
whether a Swiss construction firm bribed the Russian president and
his family in exchange for lucrative Kremlin renovation contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, the Kremlin's fiercest
political rival, called for a parliamentary investigation into the
allegations. He also warned Yeltsin against taking any
``unconstitutional steps'' to hold on to power past his term in
office, which expires next summer. At the same time, Luzhkov said
Parliament should provide legal guarantees for Yeltsin to make it
possible for the president ``to live and work'' after leaving the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to be a democratic country, we must stop
persecuting people leaving senior positions, as fear of persecution
makes them cling to power until their last days,'' Luzhkov said.
Moscow is rife with rumors that Yeltsin will try to declare
emergency rule to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, corruption allegations against top officials, however
true the charges may turn out to be, usually have little to do with
fighting corruption. Such cases tend to surface here only when one
political clan or another is losing power in Moscow's backroom
political battles. So while few here doubt that the accusations of
graft being levied against the president and his closest advisers
are plausible, fewer still doubt that the matter's greater
significance is that is presages the end of the Yeltsin era.
</P>
<P>
   ``These accusations represent the final assault on Yeltsin's
reputation,'' said Andrei Ryabov, a political analyst at the Moscow
Carnegie Center. ``The legal question of whether they are proven or
not is less important that the fact that the public will never
trust Yeltsin again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Markov, director of the Moscow-based Center for Political
Studies, agreed, saying, ``Everybody understands that the Yeltsin
regime is sinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal in question involves a Swiss firm called Mabetex,
which in 1994 won contracts worth an estimated $640 million to
refurbish the Kremlin. Skuratov and Swiss investigators say that
Mabetex may have paid as much as $15 million in bribes and
kickbacks for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera cited
Swiss law-enforcement sources in reporting that Mabetex paid out
about $1 million to Yeltsin and his daughters, Tatiana Dyachenko
and Yelena Okulova. Skuratov, who technically remains Russia's
prosecutor general, repeated those allegations this week. Mabetex
executives deny paying any bribes, and Yeltsin, through his
spokesman, denies receiving any.
</P>
<P>
   In another matter, Skuratov said that about 780 current and
former government officials are under investigation for using
inside information to speculate on Russia's once lucrative treasury
bill market.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov began cooperating with Swiss authorities this year in
investigating Mabetex's relationship with the Kremlin. At the time,
prosecutors also began looking into the affairs of business tycoon
and Kremlin insider Boris Berezovsky, whom prosecutors suspect of
embezzling funds from the state-owned Aeroflot airline. These moves
prompted Yeltsin to try to force the prosecutor's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   To pressure Skuratov, the Kremlin had Russian State Television
broadcast a videotape of a man resembling the prosecutor in bed
with prostitutes. Nevertheless, the upper house of Russia's
parliament, which must approve the prosecutor's hiring and firing,
refused to accept Skuratov's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov's investigations coincided with a sharp decline in
Yeltsin's authority after the financial meltdown here last August,
when Russia's currency lost 70 percent of its value in a matter of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Following the crash, Yeltsin was forced to accept a political
opponent, Yevgeny Primakov, as his prime minister. Primakov, whom
Yeltsin fired in May, is considered Russia's most popular
politician today. He has teamed up with Moscow Mayor Luzhkov and
Russia's powerful regional leaders in a political alliance that
analysts say should dominate elections to Parliament in December
and for president next June.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here say the Mabetex scandal is yet another sign that
Russia's all-encompassing bureaucracy _ here dubbed ``the party of
power'' _ is abandoning Yeltsin and embracing Luzhkov and Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elite no longer needs Yeltsin and his clan,'' said
Moscow-based political analyst Vladimir Pribylovsky. ``The party of
power has decided to switch leaders and the Mabetex investigation
is witness to this fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the Mabetex scandal mushrooms, Western media are
reporting that as much as $15 billion may have been laundered
through the Bank of New York with Kremlin complicity.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal and anti-Kremlin
Yabloko party, ridiculed the Western media for its recent
``discovery'' that corruption was a problem in Russia, calling it
``a collective recovery of sight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody living in Russia has known for many years that the
country is riddled with corruption and financial wrongdoing,''
Yavlinsky said.

BROWNS' COUCH NO BABE IN ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Driving to and from work at Lees County High School
in Hyden, Ky. _ early in the morning or late at night, spring
through winter; it made no difference _ Tim Koogler would pass the
two-story house and see the little boy out there on the front lawn.
The junior varsity head coach and varsity assistant began to take
the sight for granted, as if the kid were part of the shrubbery.
</P>
<P>
   He was always on the 75-foot expanse of grass, it seemed, always
throwing a football. Often he'd be playing catch with his big
brother, but a human target wasn't a necessity. Illuminated in the
darkness by the lights his father had installed, he'd be out there
alone, improvising until bedtime, drilling passes to the utility
pole 30 yards away near the roadway that served as his makeshift
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing changed about the scene over the years, Koogler
noticed. Like the shrubs, the kid kept growing, and so did his
proficiency and his reputation and eventually his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   All of them, in fact, have reached unimaginable proportions for
Tim Couch _ former high school legend, recent college
program-saver, and current National Football League poster boy as
the top pick in the 1999 draft.
</P>
<P>
   In their latest incarnation, the expansion Cleveland Browns
decided to build their second coming around Couch, choosing the
6-foot-5-inch, 225-pound junior quarterback from the University of
Kentucky with the No. 1 selection in April and investing in him a
$12.5 million signing bonus and a seven-year contract that could
top out at $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   They've made him rich, but not the starter. When the Browns open
the season against the Pittsburgh Steelers Sept. 12, Couch will be
the understudy to journeyman Ty Detmer. Unlike previously anointed
No. 1 saviors such as John Elway and Peyton Manning, who were
thrown immediately into the fire and the fanfare, Couch will be
nurtured slowly, cultivated like one of those shrubs in his front
yard. That's been the plan right along, emphasizes coach Chris
Palmer, the former Boston University boss and Patriots assistant
who has tutored, among others, Pro Bowlers Drew Bledsoe and Mark
Brunell. The Browns experienced no dissatisfaction when they
unwrapped their prize package. Quite the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's developed very, very nicely,'' says Palmer. ``He's done
everything we've asked. And he's used to the pressure. He carried
Kentucky. He turned around Kentucky's program and now he has a
chance to turn ours around.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually. And that makes sense to Couch, an unassuming sort
who with a few blond curls could pass for Larry Bird's twin and
whose college quarterback coach, Chris Masters, calls him ``just a
big ol' country boy from the hills of Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a rookie quarterback,'' says Couch. ``It's going to take
time. I've got a long way to go. I feel really comfortable. It's
just a matter of getting repetitions. I know what I'm doing in
practice. I've just got to learn the reads during games. I think
I'm capable of playing really well. It's just a matter of
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence was really mixed in the exhibition season, he
learned. Couch was superb in two relief appearances, rallying the
Browns to victory in their Hall of Fame Game opener, a 20-17
decision over the Cowboys (11 for 17, 137 yards, 1 touchdown), and
against the Bears in a 35-24 shootout (10 for 14, 128 yards, 1 TD).
But like the rest of the team, he was a dud in a 30-3 debacle at
Tampa (5 for 12, 27 yards). He was decidedly indifferent in his
lone start, a 24-17 loss to the Vikings that christened Cleveland
Browns Stadium (8 for 17, 77 yards). And in Thursday's finale, a
30-17 loss to the Eagles, Couch (5 for 9, 41 yards) was outplayed
by fellow first-round pick Donovan McNabb of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Disregarding the numbers, he made an immediate impression on his
teammates, especially one with a rather lofty frame of reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first chance he got to play,'' recalls Dave Wohlabaugh,
Bledsoe's center with the Patriots before joining Cleveland, ``he
seemed really poised. I was shocked. He wasn't stuttering or
anything in the huddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because Couch has been preparing for this moment
almost since the cradle. Growing up in Hyden, a hamlet of 350 in
Kentucky's southeastern hills that once was a coal mining center
but whose principal employer now is the Board of Education, he
realized that his recreational opportunities were limited, if not
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go through town right now,'' says Onzie Feltner, who
began coaching Couch in the second grade at Hyden Elementary
School, ``there's probably a bunch of kids sitting in the parking
lot talking and watching the traffic go by.''
</P>
<P>
   For more interesting diversions, you'd have to drive to Perry
County, 20 miles away, to take in a movie or pump quarters into an
arcade. Or you could opt for the type of home entertainment Couch
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really have anything to do except throw a ball,'' he
says. ``There was nothing else to occupy my time. I've always seen
myself as an NFL quarterback. I've wanted to be one ever since I
can remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what he first wanted to be was just like his brother.
Four and a half years older, Greg was Tim's idol and throwing
partner from the beginning. And since Greg was a quarterback, Tim
became one, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we played football,'' recalls Greg, who now helps
manage his brother's career, ``we'd be on opposite teams so we
could both be quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim was Greg's rival in pickup games but his successor in
organized football. ``He was always one team behind me,'' says
Greg. ``He'd take over when I left.''
</P>
<P>
   That pattern began under Feltner. Tim would tag along with Greg
to practice and play along the sidelines with a bunch of other
little brothers. When his time came to don the uniform, Feltner
utilized Tim at every backfield position so he could familiarize
himself with each assignment. But there was no doubt about his
permanent position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had a strong arm,'' says Feltner. ``It seemed like
even at the start, he'd throw with his whole body; a lot of people
just throw with their arm. I guess you could call him a
tailback-quarterback. If we had to pass the ball, the quarterback
would lateral to him and he'd throw on a rollout or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   By sixth grade, you could call Tim strictly a
quarterback-quarterback, and he's been there ever since. Even then,
he seemed to be aiming toward the horizon. ``You could always tell
he had something in mind down the road,'' says Feltner.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he took over the huddle for Koogler's JVs, ``real
uncommon for a seventh- or eighth-grader,'' says the coach. But
there was no mistaking he belonged. Koogler once saw a Couch pass
leave a gouge the length of his receiver's hand between the two
middle fingers. For laughs, he'd stand at the 50-yard line and bet
Koogler a Gatorade that he could hit the goalpost with a pass.
Couch never went thirsty.
</P>
<P>
   And Leslie County High feasted. During Couch's tenure, the
stadium swelled with 7,000 fans _ 20 times the town's population _
on football Fridays as he led the team to the state semifinals as a
junior and senior. Along the way, he set national high school
records for TD passes, yardage, completions, and completion
percentage, in the process setting off a recruiting hysteria. But
he created doubts about his sanity by turning down Florida State
and Tennessee and Penn State to attend Kentucky, which was riding
the momentum of a typical 1-10 season. ``It was loyalty or
something, I guess,'' says Koogler, now the head high school coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my home state school,'' explains Couch. ``I grew up
wanting to play there. I watched them as a kid. It seemed like the
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not during his freshman year, when he struggled in coach Bill
Curry's option offense, which was catastrophically ill-suited to
Couch's talents. But he flourished after Hal Mumme took over the
Wildcats in his sophomore season and brought in Masters as
quarterback tutor.
</P>
<P>
   Masters arrived from Central Florida, where he'd worked with a
kid by the name of Daunte Culpepper, Minnesota's top draft choice
last spring. ``Culpepper can throw the ball a little farther,''
says Masters. ``But Couch can throw more types of passes. And he
throws the most catchable ball I've ever seen. He's the Greg Maddux
of football. People don't understand: Why throw your fastball if
you can win with your changeup?''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats' fortunes changed up in the next two years, capped
by last season's 7-5 record that culminated in an Outback Bowl
berth. Operating Mumme's and Masters's West Coast offense, Couch
became a sizzling commodity, setting seven NCAA records, earning
All-America honors, finishing as a Heisman Trophy finalist _ and
emerging as a prime candidate to go No. 1 in the draft if he chose
to leave school early.
</P>
<P>
   His dedication never was in doubt. A four-month season still
wasn't enough. During the winter, Tim would call Greg, who was
finishing up his quarterbacking career at Eastern Kentucky, and
have his brother bring some teammates 20 minutes down the road to
Lexington for a little seven-on-seven session with the Wildcats.
``He's going to play football until he can't walk,'' says Masters.
``That's how much he loves the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The one reservation about Couch concerned arm strength, and
Masters considers that a misconception because Kentucky's scheme
emphasized throwing underneath the coverage. ``A lot of guys can
throw 80 or 90 yards,'' says Masters. ``But not many can throw the
`out' route? Our old offensive coordinator, Mike Leach, said it
best: `I got eight or nine linemen who can throw the ball farther
than Couch. Would you want to draft them No. 1?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns eventually provided the answer, though they wanted to
make sure before committing the reborn franchise's cornerstone
pick. ``The first workout he had for us,'' says Cleveland
quarterback coach John Hufnagel, ``he had good arm strength, but
there were still some questions. The second workout, he'd answered
all the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's just one left: Can Couch dominate at this level as
he has since grammar school? Make that two: Is he jaded by the
whole process after all these years?
</P>
<P>
   ``It never grows old,'' he says, eyes sparkling. ``You always
set the challenge to get to the top after starting at the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal history says he'll do it. Just ask that utility pole.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland
contains no exhibit memorializing Franklin Delano Roosevelt's
crucial role in creating a mass audience for the African-American
art form known as rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   When people talk about rock 'n' roll's crossover into mainstream
white culture, the decade they're usually talking about is the
1950s, and the person who usually gets the credit is Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   But the groundwork for the youth culture that supported rock 'n'
roll's growth was laid two decades earlier by the Roosevelt
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The important role played by big government in creating teen
culture is explained this month in a magazine largely owned by, of
all people, the conservative presidential candidate Steve Forbes.
The magazine is American Heritage, and the article, ``The Rise and
Decline of the Teenager,'' is an excerpt from a new book by Thomas
Hine called ``The Rise and Fall of the American Teenager.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the American Heritage excerpt, Hine takes the
self-serving baby-boomer view that teen-age culture started to
decline, oh, right around the time he ceased participating in it.
The ``decline'' portion of Hine's article is the sketchiest and
least convincing part; perhaps he fleshes out his argument more
convincingly in the book. But the ``rise'' portion is fascinating,
and highly persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Hine's thesis is that ``teen-agers'' didn't really exist as a
cohesive social group before the Depression. (The word first
appeared in print in 1941, in Popular Science magazine.) But
``after 1933, when Franklin D. Roosevelt took office, virtually all
young people were thrown out of work, as part of a public policy to
reserve jobs for men trying to support families.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hine might also have pointed out that a similar
impetus to throw old people out of work would later lead to the
creation of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Hine continues: ``Businesses could actually be fined if they
kept childless young people on their payrolls. Also, for the first
two years of the Depression, the Roosevelt administration
essentially ignored the needs of the youths it had turned out of
work, except in the effort of the Civilian Conservation Corps
(CCC), which was aimed at men in their late teens and early
twenties.''
</P>
<P>
   What did these unwanted youths do? They went to high school.
Although public high schools had been around since 1821 (and prep
schools had been around before then), secondary education, Hine
writes, had been ``very slow to win acceptance among working-class
families that counted on their children's incomes for survival.''
It wasn't until 1933 that a majority of high-school-age children in
the United States were actually enrolled in high school.
</P>
<P>
   By 1940, Hine writes, ``an overwhelming majority of young people
were enrolled, and perhaps more important, there was a new
expectation that nearly everyone would go, and even graduate.''
When the United States entered World War II the following year,
high-school students received deferments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young men of seventeen, sixteen, and younger had been soldiers
in all of America's previous wars,'' Hine writes. ``By 1941 they
had come to seem too young'' (1941 was also the year when Archie,
the definitive comic-book teen-ager, was introduced to the world by
John L. Goldwater, who died earlier this year, and Bob Montana).
</P>
<P>
   Hine argues, quite persuasively, that the indulgent mass
``teen-age'' culture is largely the result of corralling most of
society's 14-to-18-year-olds into American high schools. The baby
boom, which began in 1946, the year after the war ended, obviously
fed that teen-age culture's further expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But the teen culture itself--Archie and Jughead, bobby-soxer
mania for Frank Sinatra, etc.--quite obviously predates the teen
years of the very oldest baby boomers, who didn't enter those
golden years--15, 16--until the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Hine doesn't get into this, but boomer math contradicts the
boomer mythology that that it was the baby boom that first absorbed
rock 'n' roll into the mass culture. For many pop-culture
historians, the Year Zero for rock 'n' roll as a mass-cult
phenomenon was 1956. That's when Elvis recorded his first No. 1
hit, ``Heartbreak Hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   You can also make a decent case that the Year Zero was 1955,
when Bill Haley and the Comets hit No. 1 with ``Rock Around the
Clock,'' the first rock 'n' roll record ever to climb to the top of
the charts.
</P>
<P>
   Were the consumers who turned ``Rock Around the Clock'' and
``Heartbreak Hotel'' into hit records 9 and 10 years old? Of course
they weren't. They were teen-agers who'd been born during and
shortly before World War II. And they wouldn't have existed as a
social group if FDR--who, tragically, died before he got a chance
to witness the mainstreaming of rock 'n' roll--hadn't invented
them.

<P>
   With the Ryder Cup blossoming after years of disinterest, the
PGA Tour will attempt to ride the wave with next year's Presidents
Cup. After the United States vs. Europe in two weeks at The Country
Club, the followup will be the US vs. the world minus Europe at the
Robert Trent Jones Golf Club on Lake Manassas in Virginia next Oct.
16-22.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the International Federation of PGA Tours/World
Golf Championships to ponder. Wasn't this no more than PGA Tour
commissioner Tim Finchem's brazen attempt to steal Greg Norman's
thunder regarding a World Tour? There are three events this year,
four next year. The purses are $5 million for a select group, with
$1 million going to the winner. Tiger Woods just won the NEC
Invitational in Akron.
</P>
<P>
   This gives Woods more than $4.2 million in official earnings in
16 events. Jack Nicklaus earned just under $5.7 million in official
money over 38 years on the PGA Tour and just over $2.8 million in
PGA Senior Tour earnings in 10 years. The fact that golf became a
global game in earnest at the start of the decade sometimes
obscures that it was a game played by the international set with
great success even though recognition was seldom given outside the
competitors' own national or regional boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   However, the World Golf Hall of Fame near St. Augustine, Fla.,
duly recognizes historic figures Old Tom and Young Tom Morris,
Tommy Armour, and Willie Anderson of Scotland, James Braid, Harry
Vardon, John H. Taylor, and Henry Cotton of England, Bobby Locke of
South Africa, and Peter Thompson of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   This is just a sampling of the 77 people enshrined in a Hall
that also includes the LPGA Hall of Fame. The 1999 ballots were due
to be returned this past weekend, and professional players 40 or
older have been made eligible for induction. This opened the door
for Nick Faldo, Beth Daniel, Amy Alcott, who qualified through
relaxed requirements, and Seve Ballesteros.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are allowed to vote for a maximum of four players and, to
be named to the hall, a player had to be chosen on least 75 percent
of the ballots returned. There were 17 players on the ballot. They
were (in alphabetical order): Peter Allis of England, Isao Aoki of
Japan, Neil Coles and Max Faulker of England, Chako Higuchi of
Japan, Tony Jacklin of England, Bernhard Langer of Germany, Sandy
Lyle of Scotland, Graham Marsh and Kel Nagle of Australia, Christy
O'Connor Sr. of Ireland, Ayako Okamota and Jumbo Ozaki of Japan,
Dai Rees of Wales, Flory van Donck of Belgium, Norman von Nida of
Australia and Ian Woosnam of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   There are relative unknowns. Who's heard of van Donck and/or von
Nida? Yet, von Donck won 23 European Tour events and won seven in
1953. He matched von Nida's European record. Von Donck won open
championships in seven countries on the European Tour and
represented his homeland 19 times in the World Cup of Golf where he
won the individual title in 1960. Von Nida's seven Europeans
triumphs were in 1947, and he won five times in 1948. He won the
Queensland Open six times, the New South Wales Open five times, the
Australian PGA Championship on four occasions, and the Australian
Open three times.
</P>
<P>
   There are four who seem to jump out. Higuchi is a golfer of rare
distinction in her homeland. She won 69 times on the Japanese LPGA
Tour. What singles her out for particular distinction is her
triumph in the 1977 LPGA Championship at Bay Tree Golf Plantation
in North Myrtle Beach, S.C. She is the only Japanese player, male
or female, to win a major professional championship. She could also
become the first Japanese player to earn induction to the World
Golf Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Jacklin's name comes to mind in this Ryder Cup year since he was
the guiding light behind the upsurgence of the Europeans in the
matches. Winner of 27 global victories including the British Open
(1969) at Royal Lytham and the US Open (1970) at Hazeltine
National, Jacklin played on seven Ryder Cup teams and was captain
four times, guiding the Europeans to their first victory on US soil
in 1987 at Muirfield Village.
</P>
<P>
   Christy O'Connor Sr., whose nephew Christy Jr. was a Ryder Cup
hero when he beat Fred Couples to ensure the Cup would be retained
at The Belfry in 1989, played in 10 Ryder Cup competitions, which
was a record until Faldo played in his 11th two years ago at
Valderrama. O'Connor also won 24 times on the European Tour and
teamed with Harry Bradshaw to win the World Cup for the British
Isles in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Langer, who was overlooked as a captain's pick for the European
Ryder Cup team by Mark James, has won 37 PGA European Tour events
and 51 times worldwide. He also won the Masters twice. These are
four to open with, and go from there.

VETERANS TARGET FALSE CLAIMS OF WARTIME VALOR

<P>
   STONEHAM, Mass. _ For a while, Wayne Higley was a hero, a Navy
SEAL and Vietnam War veteran fond of wearing his three Purple
Hearts, his Navy Cross, and showing off the battle scars on his now
middle-aged legs.
</P>
<P>
   But his record was a lie. And when confronted once, Higley lied
again. And again. That was too much for members of the Naval
Special Warfare Archives, a group dedicated to exposing _ and
shaming _ those who pretend to be military heroes.
</P>
<P>
   So last month, they flew to Boston and knocked on the unemployed
52-year-old Higley's door, cameras in tow, prepared to conduct an
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   Higley immediately tried to leave his apartment, but upon seeing
three burly Navy SEALs and a documentary crew from the BBC, he
retreated inside, only to be coaxed outside again by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I raised my voice,'' said R.D. Russell, founder of the group,
which checked out Higley's actual record. ``But I explained to him
that he had hurt a lot of people. He had done a lot of damage to
veterans and servicemen everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The retired Navy SEALs struggled to control their tempers.
``Beforehand, we had to develop these rules of engagement because
these guys were so keyed up. These guys, they were shaking when
they finished talking to him. And they all felt that he's going to
do this again. But if he continues this stuff, it's never going to
end,'' said Don Tocci, a SEAL from Stoneham who snapped pictures of
the berating.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Colorado, the Naval Special Warfare Archives is a group
of former Navy SEALs committed to exposing what they see as a
growing number of men falsely claiming Vietnam War credentials.
SEALs _ the acronym stands for Sea, Air, and Land _ are the Navy's
elite special-operations force. They specialize in water-based
clandestine operations.
</P>
<P>
   Like so much about the Vietnam War, the group's response is
heightened, their anger charged, and their words laced with moral
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider this the same as standing and desecrating one of
the graves of the SEAL brothers and all the others that gave their
lives _ that's how bad these people are,'' said Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Higley says the shaming is bizarre and excessive. He admits he
lied, a small fib that grew larger and larger over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did was wrong, but when is it going to end?'' Higley
asked, referring to the confrontation before the TV crew last
month. ``I don't need any more of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Higley is the latest of what the group states is 4,000 men who
have falsely espoused Navy credentials and been caught. Believing
that they have truth on their side _ and with the cooperation of
the Navy and a 9,300-name database _ organizers said they are
unapologetic about embarrassing men whom they consider military
charlatans.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group posted Higley's story on the Internet, in
which they called him a ``slimeball'' and a ``detestable specimen
of patriotic American.'' There are pictures of the confrontation,
with Higley staring at the ground, cane in hand, in every shot.
</P>
<P>
   The group asserts that most veterans back them, especially those
who have come in contact with people who faked their credentials.
For Diane Carlson Evans, a Vietnam War nurse who in 1984 founded
the Vietnam Women's Memorial in Washington, D.C., Higley was as
good a fake as a fake vet gets.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to the memorial, with Evans by his side, Higley
cried, pointed to the statue of the wounded soldier in the arms of
attending nurses, and said: ``That's me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell, I think Wayne Higley should have won the
Academy Award last year for best actor,'' Evans said from her
Montana home, ``because he certainly had many of us fooled and many
of us are not easily fooled anymore. I can usually pick the
wannabes out, but Wayne had us all fooled. He was a master actor
and played his part passionately.''
</P>
<P>
   When first confronted by a group of local veterans in 1998,
Higley admitted his lie and promised not to lie again. But earlier
this year he did, offering help to a Burlington veterans group.
</P>
<P>
   Before his story came to light, Higley readily talked to friends
and veterans groups, accepted awards, and backed up his talk with
impressive-sounding credentials. In recent years, he developed a
nationwide reputation for his ability to bring an audience to tears
with tales of bravery overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But Higley was never in battle. He was never even overseas. He
never won a single Purple Heart, let alone three. As for the Navy
Cross, the second highest medal any Naval officer can receive,
Higley never came close. The scars on his legs are from a
non-military accident.
</P>
<P>
   Higley's real-life military career was lackluster, according to
his military record obtained through the Freedom of Information Act
by the Naval Special Warfare Archives. Higley served two years in
southeastern Virginia. Upon completion of his two-year stint as a
low-ranking ``beachmaster,'' he was never asked to reenlist.
</P>
<P>
   Richard DelRossi, a Stoneham police officer, began working with
Higley in 1997 to bring the Vietnam Veterans Moving Wall to
Stoneham. The two became fast friends, visiting the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial in Washington and leaning on each other from time
to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were probably as tight as brothers get,'' said DelRossi.
``If I wasn't working, I'd be doing something with Wayne. Myself
and everybody else was just taken in by the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   After both men helped raise money to help pay off the debts of
the Vietnam Women's Memorial, Higley and DelRossi were invited down
a second time to speak as part of the monument's rededication.
</P>
<P>
   Before they went, however, DelRossi sent messages to various
Navy SEAL Web sites to help reunite Higley with some of his old
mates. A day later, DelRossi had messages from across the country.
All said the same thing: Higley's a phony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got home that night and my computer wasn't on, but it was
smoking,'' DelRossi said. ``I still didn't believe.''
</P>
<P>
   DelRossi did his own checking, and the truth came flooding in
with every phone call. Higley was confronted by the Stoneham wall
organizers, and promised never to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Tocci, a Burlington High School teacher, began shooting the
breeze with Higley about his time in Vietnam in 1997 during Tocci's
visit to the Stoneham wall. It was only later that DelRossi told
Tocci that Higley had been using Tocci's Purple Heart story as his
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'd ever told this story myself to a group of
people,'' said Tocci, ``and he's using my story in front of
audiences and these women were crying over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The two later discovered that Higley was also using a story
copied from a Medal of Honor citation for another veteran. Higley
simply changed the award to the Navy Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Higley is not the only Massachusetts resident to be exposed for
faking military credentials. The Bay State has been rife with
similar stories.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Smith, founder of the New England Shelter for Homeless
Veterans in Boston, was found to have boasted of battles he never
fought and donned awards he never won. John Yandle, a convicted
murderer, was released from prison after falsely claiming to be a
Vietnam War hero but was sent back to jail after admitting he lied.
Politicians John Lakian and Royall Switzler also said they had
Vietnam experience that was later proved false.
</P>
<P>
   For Dr. John Greene, a staff psychologist at the Veterans
Administration Outpatient Clinic in Boston, wannabe vets are a
simple but heinous case of lies getting out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people would like to be heroes or would like to think
they measure up, so they create this myth that gets better with
age,'' Greene said. ``And as years go by, you tell a lie long
enough, you believe it. I think it happens with all veterans. But
for a few, it gets out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Higley acknowledges that he fell into this pattern, but wonders
how much punishment fits this offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong. I admitted it,'' he said. ``I don't know what I
have to do. All I want to do is get it behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he lied, Higley said he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could answer that,'' he said, ``I probably wouldn't have
done it.''

--EXERCISE IS FOUND TO BE AN INHIBITOR OF GALLSTONES  
 --STUDY: YO-YO DIETING RISKS ARE NOT AS BAD AS FEARED  
 --MAJORITY OF DRUG USERS ARE EMPLOYED FULL TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 Exercise is found to be an inhibitor of gallstones
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gallstones can be excrutiatingly painful. They're common,
affecting up to 15 percent of all adults. And they're responsible
for more than $5 billion a year in hospital costs.
</P>
<P>
   Now a large new study shows the risk of gallstone attacks can be
significantly reduced by a simple, cheap measure that confers all
kinds of other benefits: exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Women who engage in even moderate amounts of exercise reduce
their risk of gallbladder surgery by as much as 40 percent,
according to an analysis of more than 60,000 women in the
Boston-based Nurses Health Study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apparent protective effect can be achieved not only by
vigorous physical activity but also by moderate forms of exercise,
such as brisk walking,'' Dr. Michael F. Leitzmann of the Nurses
Health Study and his colleagues write in the current New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, women who get the least recreational exercise have
more than twice the risk of developing gallbladder disease severe
enough to require surgery, compared to the least-sedentary women,
the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Two previous studies have documented a similar exercise effect
on the risk of gallbladder disease in men.
</P>
<P>
   The new research suggests that exercise exerts an independent
effect in reducing gallstone attacks, and does not work merely by
reducing weight _ a well-known risk factor for gallbladder disease.
But of course, by helping with weight reduction exercise may confer
a double effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the reasons for the associated reduction in risk may
be unclear, regular exercise is usually a good idea for other
reasons as well,'' write Drs. Kenneth J. Vega and David E. Johnston
of the University of New Mexico in an accompanying editorial.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Study: yo-yo dieting risks are not as bad as feared
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More good news comes from what might be called Daughter of
Nurses Study: A report that discounts at least some of the health
risks of yo-yo-dieting.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about earlier reports that repeated cycles of weight
loss and gain raised the risk of high blood pressure, Alison E.
Field and her colleagues at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston
studied 46,224 women in Nurses Health Study II, a project launched
in 1989. (The original Nurses Health Study began in 1976.)
</P>
<P>
   The Boston group found that yo-yo dieting was very common among
the women in Nurses Study II. Between 1989 and 1993, 41 percent had
two or more episodes of intentional weight loss. Nearly 1 in 5
reported three or more dieting episodes with losses of 10 pounds or
more _ a group the researchers called ``mild weight cyclers.''
About 2 percent were ``severe weight cyclers,'' intentionally
losing more than 20 pounds in three or more dieting episodes.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of high blood pressure was not higher among any
category of yo-yo dieters, the study found. What mattered, in terms
of hypertension risk, was how much more the women weighed at the
end of the four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the repeated weight losses, severe weight cyclers
gained more weight . . . than mild weight cyclers, who gained more
weight than non-weight cyclers,'' the researchers report in the
September issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previous studies hadn't looked at net weight change over
time,'' Field said in an interview. ``If you don't consider that,
it looks like weight cycling is bad for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings should reassure those concerned about the health
risks of unsuccessful dieting. ``If someone wants to go ahead and
try to lose weight, that's wonderful,'' Field said. ``If they don't
succeed the first time, this data suggests they shouldn't be
deterred from other attempts.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Majority of drug users are employed full time
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular impression, the great majority of illicit
drug users are full-time workers, not obvious ne'er-do-wells.
</P>
<P>
   A study published by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration found that 70 percent of illicit
drug users _ 6.3 million workers between the ages of 18 and 49 _
are employed full time. Almost as many, 6.2 million US full-time
workers, are heavy alcohol users.
</P>
<P>
   Of full-time workers reporting illicit drug use in 1997, when
the survey was done, 62 percent said they used marijuana only.
Another 38 percent said they used other drugs, such as psychoactive
prescription drugs, cocaine, and hallucinogens.

MEET GUMBEL'S NEW `COLLABORATOR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former ABC television news reporter Jane Clayson, 33, the
announced choice as Bryant Gumbel's cohost on his upcoming CBS
morning telecast, calls her new job ``the opportunity of a
lifetime'' and says she and Gumbel, 18 years her senior, would be
``collaborators, not competitors'' in their roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm committed to be his partner. We are a team,'' she told
television reporters in a national teleconference from Manhattan
this week. Asked about ``differences'' in their generations, she
said their ``perspectives'' would be no problem.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Friedman, senior executive producer of the show, called
``The Early Show,'' said that although 300 tapes had been perused
and 100 interviews conducted, ``no one was offered the job besides
Jane.'' Rumors had speculated on everyone up to and including Oprah
Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   Clayson, who was ABC's Los Angeles correspondent, said she's
been in the business 10 years and three with ABC. She met the
television press accompanied by Friedman and CBS News president
Andrew Hayward. She was grilled about everything from her shoe size
(8 1/2 narrow) to her religion (Mormon).
</P>
<P>
   Clayson said she hadn't lived in Utah all her life and that she
``came from different places. I grew up in Boston, Seattle, and
Nashville. I've been all over the place. I didn't grow up in Utah.
I went to school and worked there.'' She said her family traveled
while her father was in training to be a doctor, including seven
years in the Boston area while her father was an intern and
resident at Boston City Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She was also questioned about her friendship with the Osmonds _
laughing, she said they were ``not close'' _ and about her decision
to come to New York from her Los Angeles base after previously
declining opportunities, saying she had wanted to be with her
husband. She disclosed that since her refusal, she and her husband
had had a ``difficult separation'' that was followed by a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Clayson said she and Gumbel had ``many meetings'' and that ``he
has been very supportive, encouraging, and honest. He's been very
kind to me. It was like meeting an old friend. We just clicked.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said ``a great majority'' of affiliates are carrying
the show for its two full hours. The Gumbel/Clayson show debuts
Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do a show that puts us on the playing field,''
Friedman said, referring to the network's lag in morning
television. ``We have to look at where we are in six, eight, or 10
months. You have to look at how you wear and hope you wear well.''

FOR PRINE, CHEATING IS A POINT OF PRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cheating songs have been an integral part of country music for
many years, but you don't often hear an album filled with them _
and certainly not as duets with some of the top female singers of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this idea for 15 years _ doing cheating songs with all
different women,'' says John Prine, the Grammy-winning songwriter.
``I'd bring it up once in a while and just bore everybody at the
table with it. The hardest part was just getting started.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Prine finally got it started. He made up a wish
list of singers _ and was shocked when the first nine said yes. ``I
thought they'd beg off and tell me they were going to be in China
for two years or something,'' Prine says. ``But everybody was
anxious to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was through, Prine rounded up a Who's Who of
country's elite women singers _ Emmylou Harris, Lucinda Williams,
Iris DeMent, Patty Loveless, and Trisha Yearwood, together with
old-school legends Connie Smith and Melba Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``In Spite of Ourselves,'' a 16-song collection of
mostly classic male/female duets with cheating as a theme; there
also are a few pure love songs for good measure _ one the
devotional `` 'Til a Tear Becomes a Rose,'' sung with his wife,
Fiona.
</P>
<P>
   The album comes out Tuesday _ and Prine is supporting it with a
tour. He'll be backed by a band and will touch upon the CD (for
which he actually wrote only the title track), while also dipping
into his own signature tunes, from the aching ``Angel From
Montomgery'' (a song Bonnie Raitt often performs), ``Hello in
There,'' and ``Sam Stone'' to the biting social commentary of
``Blow Up Your TV'' and ``Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven
Anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Prine is especially happy to be on tour again _ and to have a
new album out _ because he's recovering from cancer, which forced
him to take last year off. He doesn't like to talk about his
illness (``I went to a lot of doctors at first that I didn't trust
_ it was like going to car dealers''). But he's been given a clean
bill of health since having surgery to remove the tumor last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took a portion of my neck out and I had a lot of
radiation treatments,'' Prine says. ``Along with the surgery, I
also quit smoking. I had smoked a pack of day for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville-based Prine, now 52, says ``the surgery changed my
voice and dropped it (tonally) so I had to change the keys of some
of my old songs. It made it much closer to my talking voice. . . .
But it's a joy to sing again. Everything seems brand new to me.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the new album, it includes such historic tunes as Bobby
Braddock's ``(We're Not) the Jet Set'' (which Prine sings with
DeMent), the Roger Miller/Bill Anderson song ``When Two Worlds
Collide'' (a ballad sung with Yearwood, and a hit for Jerry Lee
Lewis in the '70s), the dry-witted ``We Must Have Been Out of Our
Minds'' (with Montgomery), and a tongue-in-cheek wife-swapping
number, ``Let's Invite Them Over'' (with DeMent).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really glad the way the record turned out,'' says Prine.
``I'm not expecting radio stations to play it, but I hope that some
of the people tired of the new stuff they hear on the radio will
latch on to it.''

PURSUIT OF PRESS HAS DIED DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's news that French authorities had concluded
photographers were not responsible for the accident that killed
Princess Diana seems light years removed from the intense
antipaparazzi fever that flared in the wake of the 1997 tragedy.
Passions have died down and the press has been exonerated. But
journalists did not escape completely unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Several bills to rein in the media's pursuit of its subjects _
including two filed by California congressman and the Personal
Privacy Protection Act introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) _ circulated on Capitol Hill last year, drawing
opposition from a slew of news industry organizations, from the
Newspaper Association of America to the Radio-Television News
Directors Association. The bills all died in Congress and now
``don't seem to be on anybody's radar screen,'' says Freedom Forum
First Amendment ombudsman Paul McMasters. One new bill, introduced
this year by Congressman John Conyers (D-Mich.), is dead in the
water, according to several sources.
</P>
<P>
   The one notable exception is California _ where the rich and
famous have a love/hate relationship with the paparazzi. A law that
became effective this year makes it the only state to offer new
civil recourse to people ardently pursued by the media in personal
or private moments.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tom Newton, general counsel for the California
Newspaper Publishers Association, former Governor Pete Wilson _ who
signed the bill _ was lobbied not only by the Screen Actors Guild
but by a coalition of angry crime victims who'd been subject to
varying degrees of media intrusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opposed it all the way through the governor's office.'' But
``we're in California here,'' says Newton, with a sigh. Thus far,
however, no one has used the state courts to test the limits of the
telephoto lens or aggressive tabloid reporter.

   The Fidelity-owned Community Newspaper Company describes it as a
chance to better deploy its resources. But some of the Greater
Boston chain's editors saw it as the last straw.
</P>
<P>
   In a recently announced restructuring, nearly 40 papers in the
company's North and Northwest units were placed under the
jurisdiction of one editor-in-chief. But the more controversial
move involved taking editors who had each run one paper and
dividing them into two-person teams (a news editor and community
editor) responsible for _ in most cases _ three papers apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving to a different kind of structure up there,''
says the company's top editor and vice chairwoman Mary Jo Meisner.
The restructuring, she adds, ``allows a lot more interaction and
time between the editors and reporters,'' and frees editors up
``from a whole range of tasks they have to do right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But some staffers reportedly saw their reassignment to community
editor _ a job that involves the processing of press releases and
police logs _ as a demotion. Others thought that assigning several
papers to each team would erode the company's commitment to local
news tailored for individual communities. Last week, four of the
affected editors gave their notice and resigned. And some hard
feelings reportedly surfaced at a series of meetings to announce
the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an open conversation,'' acknowledges Meisner. ``My
basic message is, let's give it a try. . . . We'll tweak it as we
go along.''
</P>

   Career change ahead. Michael Gartner, the former NBC News
president who became editor and co-owner of The (Ames, Iowa)
Tribune is selling the small-town paper and becoming part-owner of
the Triple-A baseball club the Iowa Cubs, according to a report in
The New York Times. The question is whether this also frees him up
for another new job. Gartner is thought to be a serious candidate
to succeed the departed Marvin Kalb as director of Harvard's Joan
Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy, a
post now being temporarily filled by professor Thomas Patterson.
Gartner was unavailable for comment Wednesday.

   His old teachers at Brookline (Mass.) High are no doubt

Post's new editorial page editor. The local product will succeed
interim editorial page editor Stephen Rosenfeld _ who took over
following the death of Meg Greenfield earlier this year _ upon
Rosenfeld's retirement in a few months. Asked about taking over the
opinion pages in these properous times when Russia is our ally and
politicians stumble over each other in the race for the center,
Hiatt says: ``I think it's a great time in the sense that a lot of
things are being rethought. It's a challenge. I don't see it as a
boring time at all.''

   After putting out every issue of CommonWealth _ the magazine of
``politics, ideas, and civic life'' published by the nonpartisan
think tank MassINC _ editor Dave Denison is leaving to run the back
pages of The American Prospect, a distinctly partisan vehicle of
the left. CommonWealth publisher Tripp Jones has been approached by
a ``good handful'' of serious candidates to succeed Denison, a
solid journalist who gave CommonWealth significant heft. So much
so, that Jones may be now be looking to liven up the pages a bit.

ANOTHER SALVO FROM SUN AGAINST MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (itals)``We are going to cut off their air supply. Everything
they are selling, we're going to give away for free.''(unitals)
    &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's what Microsoft Corp. vice president Paul Maritz was
allegedly telling computer industry executives in 1996 _ comments
that were allegedly made with reference to Microsoft's then-rival
Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But these back-room comments could have been made very easily
last month by Sun Microsystems chairman and chief executive Scott
McNeally with reference to Microsoft itself.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sun announced it was purchasing Star Division, a
California software publisher, and that it was going to take Star's
flagship product, Star Office, and give it away for free over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Sun said it was making this move to further
stimulate the growth of the Internet. Sun's stated theory was that
if more high-quality software is available on line, more people
will use the Internet, which in turn will force more service
providers to upgrade their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Since an overwhelming number of Internet servers are made by
Sun, more servers translates into increased profits for the Silicon
Valley hardware manufacturer. ``It's all part of our vision of open
network computing,'' said McNeally.
</P>
<P>
   But this reasoning is disingenuous at best. What we're really
seeing is yet another salvo in the very personal, decade-long
battle between McNeally and Gates. And unlike the Java war, this
salvo could really strike home.
</P>
<P>
   Where Microsoft gets 40 percent of its revenue from sales of
Microsoft Office, Sun makes nothing from the sale of desktop
application programs, and very little from the sale of software.
Giving away Star Office won't hurt Sun's current sales very much.
But it could ultimately slaughter Microsoft's cash cow.
</P>
<P>
   Program-for-program, Star Office is similar to the Professional
Edition of Microsoft's Office 2000, which has a street price of
$480. Star Office comes with a word processor similar to Word, a
spreadsheet similar to Excel, a presentation program similar to
PowerPoint, a data base program, a calendar, an e-mail program, and
a Web browser. None of these programs are as good as their
Microsoft counterparts, but most are good enough for the typical
Office user.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Star Writer, which is largely a clone of Microsoft's
Word 95 word processor. Star Writer can open standard Microsoft
Word files, edit them, and save them out. It will handle Word's
paragraph styles, numbered paragraphs, bulleted lists, and many
other formats. You can create tables, set bookmarks, and create
footnotes. Beginner users will be hard-pressed to find significant
differences.
</P>
<P>
   But intermediate and advanced word processor users will soon
find big differences between Word and Writer. That's because there
are literally thousands of little variations that aren't
immediately obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Undo. There is an Undo button that you can click in the
Microsoft Word spell-checker, allowing you to recover from
inadvertently changing one word to another or accidentally adding
an incorrectly spelled word to your spelling dictionary. Word's
normal Undo facility also can take you more than an hour back in
time. Writer doesn't have an Undo in its spell-checker, and its
normal Undo facility goes back just 25 steps.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a whole lot of annoying little bugs in Star
Writer. For example, if you create a new document and type two
hyphens in a row, Writer replaces them with a backslash!
</P>
<P>
   Other points of criticism include Star's documentation, which is
minimal, and the program's speed, which is sluggish at times.
</P>
<P>
   Star's drawing programs are serviceable, but they can't hold a
candle to Adobe's PhotoShop and Illustrator.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Internet programs, I would recommend avoiding both
the e-mail system and the browser. The e-mail program is awkward,
and the browser won't display many sites properly, especially those
that use frames.
</P>
<P>
   Star Office is an attack against Microsoft in another way as
well. The program alters many Windows default settings, patching
out Microsoft's programs and substituting Sun's. Among these sneak
attacks:
</P>
<P>
   --Download StarOffice 5.1, and you'll also download a copy of
Sun's Java runtime environment as well. StarOffice claims that it
requires Java to enable all of its features, although I can find no
proof to support this claim.
</P>
<P>
   --When you install Star, it becomes your default Web browser and
e-mail client, even if you tell the program that you are using
Internet Explorer and Outlook Express. To get to your old browser
you'll have to call it up manually.
</P>
<P>
   --Finally, when you run StarOffice, the program takes over your
computer's screen, going so far as substituting Microsoft's Start
button with its own. You can turn off this feature by unchecking
the menu item ``Integrated Desktop''.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Windows, Sun is also making Star Office freely available
for the free Linux operating system, as well as for Sun's Solaris.
This will undoubtedly be another huge boost for Linux, where the
lack of Microsoft-compatible productivity apps has been a major
stumbling block. Sun's reasoning seems to be that whatever helps
Linux hurts Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But realistically, Sun should be watching out for its air supply
as well.
</P>
<P>

products/staroffice/.)

CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rest of the world has already embraced our style of
clothing, our movies, and our music. Now it is embracing America's
brand of hard-nosed capitalism _ with a heavy emphasis on mergers
and restructurings.
</P>
<P>
   The trend could have important implications for investors who
are willing to venture overseas in search of higher returns.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe and Asia the business stories these days all read as
if they came straight out of the American press. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   --In France, two big retailers have just announced a merger that
will create a formidable European competitor to Wal-Mart. French
banks also are combining in preparation for a coming wave of
consolidation that is expected to cross national barriers.
</P>
<P>
   --In Germany the big banks are talking about merging and so are
the big power companies.
</P>
<P>
   --In Korea, Daewoo, the ailing conglomerate, is being broken
into pieces, a recognition that the smaller company that emerges
will have to be profitable and survive without government help.
</P>
<P>
   --In Japan, three large banks are melding to form the world's
biggest financial holding company. The executives behind the deal
insist the new entity will become one of the world's most
profitable banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is the triumph of capitalism generally,''
says Maureen Allyn, chief economic at Scudder Kemper Investments, a
mutual fund company. But it is capitalism with a distinctly
American flavor. Foreign executives are talking about profitability
and shareholder value, words that once were not part of their
vocabulary. They are playing by our rules, whether they are admit
it or not.
</P>
<P>
   It is a triumph not of ideology, but of pragmatism. The rest of
the world has watched as American companies have grown stronger, in
part by undergoing the painful process of restructuring. ``They are
saying, `If it can be successful in the United States, why can't we
do it here?' '' says Tom Moore, who manages international
portfolios at State Street Research in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest that foreign companies have no choice but to
follow the American lead. Just as they must adapt computer
technology and the Internet to stay competitive, so too must they
cut costs and become more profitable. ``These companies have to
change or they will not be players in the world market,'' says
Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decision Economics in
Waltham. ``They either have to get aboard or lose.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe the consolidation game has been spurred by the
introduction of the euro, which has made the whole continent one
big market. In Asia, the financial crisis of 1997 and the
decadelong recession in Japan have forced the corporate sector to
mend its ways.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will have important political consequences. When
companies merge and downsize, people lose their jobs. Even in the
United States, the downsizing wave proved very unpopular. Remember
the 1996 Newsweek cover story that referred to chief executives as
``Corporate Killers?''
</P>
<P>
   Job cutting will be even less popular in Asia and Europe, where
tradition and laws have made it difficult, if not impossible, to
dismiss workers. Sinai concedes the point, but insists that the
market forces at work are too powerful to slow down. ``I would
argue that within five years Europe will look a lot more like the
United States than it does today,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Just Wednesday Michelin, the French tire giant, announced a
restructuring that will result in the loss of 7,500 jobs over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean for investors?
</P>
<P>
   Simply this: There may be more opportunity to make money
overseas in the coming years than there is in the United States.
Foreign companies typically are less profitable than their American
counterparts. In Japan, an extreme case, the major banks have a
return on equity of 2 to 3 percent compared to 15 to 20 percent in
the US.
</P>
<P>
   Scudder's Allyn says both European and Asian companies can pick
``the low-hanging fruit'' and boost their profitability
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   At State Street Research, Tom Moore compares the restructuring
process to a baseball game. The United States, he says, is in the
seventh inning; Europe in the fifth; and Asia in the third.
Investors, he suggests, can do better getting in early because with
more innings left to play, there is more money left to make.
</P>
<P>
   Miren Etcheverry, who manages international investments for John
Hancock Funds, is of a similar mind. Etcheverry currently has
bigger bets on Japan and Europe than she does on the United Sattes.
Her logic is pretty basic. ``There is more room for improvement
overseas,'' she says. ``There is a bigger upside.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of health care businesses in the Boston area,
but few as interesting as WorldClinic, which Wednesday said it
raised $1.6 million in its initial round of financing.
</P>
<P>
   The Burlington, Mass. company provides medical care to Americans
working abroad and to corporate executives who travel frequently.
Bitten by a spider in Ghana; got a nasty rash in Uzbekistan;
suffering heart troubles in Latin America _ Who you gonna call?
</P>
<P>
   WorldClinic's doctors can be reached 24 hours a day. They will
outfit you with a kit full of drugs and supplies you can carry with
you, direct you to competent medical care abroad and airlift you
back home if that is required.
</P>
<P>
   The service isn't cheap _ several thousand dollars per patient
per year _ but WorldClinic chief executive Daniel Carlin doesn't
think corporations will balk at the price. ``It's a small amount to
invest for something that can improve health care dramatically,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin, an emergency medicine specialist, is one of seven
doctors on staff. Investors include Amos Hostetter, the founder of
Continental Cablevision. The Lahey Clinic is also an investor and
has provided the fledgling company with office space on its
Burlington campus.

MUSTY CLOSET NEEDS VENTILATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. One of the upstairs closets in my Cape Cod-style house smells
funny, sort of dampish and musty. Anda white shirt hanging in the
closet developed brown spots where it was closest to the wall. How
can I get rid of the smell, and the brown spots on the shirt, and
prevent them both from returning.
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS EVANS, Franklin, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah yes, moisture and mold rear their ugly heads again. Your
closet smells funny because it is closed. Water vapor builds up in
it; that causes the musty smell. When it condenses on cool surface,
that causes mold to grow. The brown stain on the shirt is probably
rust, caused by a wet steel hanger.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, keep the closet door open, or install a louvered
door so that air can circulate and prevent the buildup of water
vapor. That should take care of a lot of the problems. Also, hang a
100-watt light bulb in the closet; this will provide enough warmth
to help dissipate the water vapor and prevent condensation. Keep
the light on, of course.
</P>
<P>
   If you see black smears in the closet, or little black dots, you
know you have mildew, and should wash it with a solution of 1 part
bleach and 3 parts water. This mildew treatment may be old hat to
the handyman, but many people are discovering it for the first
time, so it's always worth repeating. Also, not old hat, is this
necessary warning: wear skin and eye proteciton when working with
bleach.
</P>
<P>
   For the brown spots on the shirt, try treating them with Whink,
a rust remover sold in supermarkets. Avoid hanging a shirt on a
metal hanger, and keep it and other clothes a little farther away
from that cool wall. I know that might not be easy or even
possible, but clothes should be kept away from cool walls.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The wallpaper in one room of my house was badly stained by
leaks from an ice dam. The paper is fairly old, and I don't think
it is vinyl-coated, but that stain really shows. How can I clean
it?
</P>
<P>
   TOM SANTORO, Malden, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Nothing that I know of will clean it, because water stains
are indelible. I don't think you can even disguise it, although you
can try erasing it with a gum eraser. If you have any spare paper
tucked away, you could use it as a patch or replace the entire
strip. This is your best chance for a match, because the spare
paper is just as old as that on the wall. It might be lighter,
however, because it has been rolled up all these years. Patching
with new paper, even if you can find the same pattern, is unlikely
to work because the old will be much darker than the new.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to this brilliant idea, if all else fails:
Repaper the entire wall with new paper of a similar pattern, or a
plain pattern. It might sound kind of funny to do one wall, but
what the heck, you solved the problem inexpensively, and such a
situation can be lived with until you are ready to redo the entire
room.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Should I seal my new driveway after one year? It will cost
$800 to seal because it is so large (it cost $3,200 to install).
</P>
<P>
   A.R., Foxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Save yourself $800, because it is not necessary to seal a
driveway, new or old. It is mostly for appearance's sake. That is
not just the handyman's opinion either, because one caller who
asked about it told the handyman that her driveway contractor said,
``Forget about it. It is only cosmetic.''

 By PATTI DOTEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. _ It's very much a New England story. A
folksy American success story.
</P>
<P>
   A simple story, really, starting with a simple idea: Sell
unbleached cotton muslin ruffled curtains through the mail. Market
them by placing handwritten and handdrawn ads in local newspapers
and national magazines. Distribute them by wrapping them on the
dining room table, loading them into the family station wagon and
mailing them at the local post office.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1956. The dining room belonged to Jane and Jack
Fitzpatrick. The post office was in Whitman. And the business was
the nation's first mail-order curtain company _ Country Curtains.
</P>
<P>
   Today, this former mom-and-pop company is based in picturesque
Norman Rockwell country and has grown into a multimillion-dollar
catalog business with 21 retail stores. The inventory has grown far
larger than the initial muslin curtains to include all types of
curtains and fabrics, top treatments, shades, sheers, lots of lace,
matching shower curtains, bed covers, canopy covers, dust ruffles,
and rods and home accessories. The catalog, too, has matured from a
flier to a booklet of sketches to a 68-page, four-color book with a
circulation in the millions. And unlike other wildly successful but
small entrepreneurial businesses, Country Curtains remains in the
hands of its founders.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership mantle has been passed to daughter Nancy
Fitzpatrick. But the driving force behind the company, the
implementor extraordinaire of her husband's ideas, remains very
much a presence. Jane Fitzpatrick may have slowed down since her
hip operations four years ago but her impeccable taste and style,
her no-nonsense, tell-it-like-it-is way of doing business is set in
concrete. Employees still quake when ``Mrs. Fitz'' rounds the
corner, but they stay on year after year because they know she
knows what she's doing, plays fair, and is generous. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Vision and energy &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Country Curtains may have been her husband's idea and he may
have been the stabilizing rudder on an ever-expanding ship, but
it's been Jane's vision and energy that kept the business afloat
and also turned two ramshackle buildings _ the 100-room Red Lion
Inn and Blantyre, a Tudor-style mansion built in 1902 _ into
moneymaking, internationally known hotels. Blantyre is a member of
Relais &AMP; Chateaux, the prestigious and selective worldwide hotel
association.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother may say she is not that involved anymore,'' says
Nancy Fitzpatrick, 52, during lunch in the courtyard of the Red
Lion Inn. ``But she still has the last word on major decisions.
She's relatively reasonable on the little things,'' she says with a
smile. ``But when it comes to a merger or acquisition or what
curtains to hang in the lobby of the inn, she has the last say.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, mother and daughter are working soul mates. There's one
other Fitzpatrick offspring, Ann Brown, but she lives in Manhattan
with a second home here in the Berkshires and is not involved in
day-to-day operations. Her major contribution was to Blantyre. She
did extensive research on Scottish manor houses, helped her mother
purchase antiques and accessories for the 1902 Tudor-style mansion
with turrets, carved friezes, and stone gargoyles, and created an
atmosphere of quiet yet sumptuous European elegance on 85 exquisite
acres. Today Ann buys the gifts and accessories for the catalog and
Country Curtains stores, the first of which opened in 1979 in
Salem.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is detail-oriented and my father always had the good
sense to let her do what she had to do,'' says Nancy, who is as
outspoken, blunt, and forceful as her mother, although her friends
say she would bristle at such a comparison. ``He was the one who
was good at dreaming up projects. My mother was the one to
implement them. And he had great ideas, huge ideas, and Mum made
them happen. My dad retired in 1996 and sold his share of stock to
employees, so there's stock now that's not in our control, that's
not ours to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The family also owns the Elm Street Market in Stockbridge,
Housatonic Curtains and Jacks Grill &AMP; Restaurant in Housatonic, and
an interest in Evviva, a women's clothing store in Lenox. Evviva
was Nancy's idea. She was tired of traveling to New York and Boston
for stylish clothes, so she found a partner and opened this upscale
shop. The family employs about 1,200 people, with between 700 and
800 working directly for Country Curtains. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Patron of the arts &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the indefatigable Jane devoted considerable time
to the arts. She was elected to the board of overseers of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1978 and then served 14 years as a
trustee. ``I was the only trustee from this area for years; I felt
like the unofficial hostess of Tanglewood, especially when the
other board members came out,'' says Jane.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, she stepped down after 22 years as president of the
board of the Berkshire Theater Festival. Again she felt relief _
free of the obligation of attending every performance, although she
had seen ``Moby Dick-Rehearsed'' the night prior to this interview.
She called the performance astounding but wouldn't say whether it
was a good or bad kind of astounding.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't hold back when the subject turns to Seiji Ozawa.
``I'm a big Seiji fan,'' says Jane. ``I'm sorry he's leaving but I
understand why. I only hope we can find a replacement who is as
open a person and as fine a musician.''
</P>
<P>
   She says the conductor at her first BSO performance was a ``kid
named Leonard Bernstein,'' and she became hooked on the Symphony
from the start. Nancy has carried on this interest along with the
awareness that the arts are an economic staple in the Berkshires.
Nancy is not only a trustee of the BSO but also of the Mass MOCA
Foundation and Interlaken School of Art and a member of the
Massachusetts Cultural Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with Tanglewood and became a lot more involved with
the BSO when Mom retired,'' says Nancy, who has a son by her first
marriage and is presently married to Lincoln Russell, a
photographer whom she met on a BSO concert tour. ``The Symphony has
such an impact out here because it's such a little town. It's also
a more intimate experience here compared to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane's initial lack of musical sophistication came from growing
up in a small town in Vermont, Cuttingsville, and attending a
one-room schoolhouse. Jack was far more sophisticated, having spent
several years as a child in Rome, where his mother was studying
voice. Then he returned to Vermont and went to high school with
Jane. They had their first date on her 15th birthday and married in
1944. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hooked on curtains &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Jack's discharge from the Army, he completed his college
education at Middlebury and then entered Boston University Law
School. His first job after graduation was at Lincoln Stores, a
regional dry goods department store chain. Watching how well
curtains were selling in the stores, he conceived of selling plain
muslin curtains (which Jane had put up in their living room) by
mail out of their home in Whitman. In 1958 Jack was transferred to
Pittsfield and moved his family to Stockbridge. A year later he
quit his job and devoted himself full time to Country Curtains. The
couple eventually moved the business out of their home and into a
building down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all very simple,'' says Jane. ``People would send us
the money; we would send them the merchandise. I loved it all from
the very beginning, even when I didn't have a typewriter and was
doing everything by hand. I did know a little about numbers because
I'd worked in the accounting department of an Army Air Force
storage depot during the war.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, the couple and their two daughters, then 14 and 11,
spent the year in Europe, leaving Country Curtains in the capable
hands of Jane's sister, Zoa Campetti, who remained a key manager
until her death in 1996. They rented a chalet in Switzerland, and
the girls went to an American school while Jane and Jack traveled
throughout continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was there that my mother learned about hotels,''
says Nancy. ``She came back to the States able to visualize what
makes a place hospitable and charming. She parlayed all she'd
learned into the flower boxes here at the Red Lion, the details in
the rooms, and introduced outdoor dining when no one was eating
alfresco _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Fitzpatricks bought the inn in 1968 _ saving it from
demolition and giving Jane new challenges. It didn't show a profit
for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never worried about it,'' says Jane, picking at her fruit
salad plate, a plate she thinks is too small for the amount being
served. ``I knew we were doing the best job we could, so why worry?
And the curtain business was carrying us. My husband did worry.
He's got a short fuse but that's offset by a great Irish wit.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mill on the Housatonic &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next company purchase, in 1976, was an old textile mill on
the Housatonic River. The Fitzpatricks restored the mill and
created the Housatonic Curtain Co. where 40 to 50 percent of their
curtains are made. They also employ 25 home stitchers, who sew the
edgings and fringes on curtains. The biggest challenge facing Nancy
is the new way of doing business _ maintaining their Web site,
filling e-mail orders, and bar coding their inventory at the
stores. She also keeps an eye on the competition, the bigggest of
which is J. C. Penney.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, they bought Blantyre and in 1994 opened Jacks Grill.
Jacks serves old-timey food that appeals to Jack's palate _ pot
roast, spaghetti, Jello and chocolate pudding. It's a popular stop
for bus-traveling elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food here at the inn can be a little pretentious,'' says
Jane. ``I don't much like my food stacked like a steeple on my
plate.''

FOR SVT F-150: THE ANSWER TO THE NEED FOR SPEED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen comes to mind as I approach the truck because
in my head I'm retrofitting a line from The Boss: ``It's sittin'
out there like a killer in the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, the Ford SVT F-150 Lightning, black and
malevolent-looking, appears to be almost melting in the sun: a
stock F-150 glistening as its skin seeps low and round and smooth.
The whole pickup truck looks crouched to pounce.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, this truck is a blast from the past. Big block.
Supercharged. Rumbling at low revs, roaring at higher revs, whining
when the supercharger kicks in. Burns rubber with even subtle taps
of the accelerator. Tosses you back in the seat in gas-guzzling,
straight-ahead leaps off the line, or sudden surges to pass in
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   It's a truck for those who still feel, or have regained, the
need for speed; a truck for gearheads and good wrenches who might
not have the time to soup-up big block V-8s on their own anymore; a
truck for those who, as Joe Pesci might have described them in ``My
Cousin Vinny,'' have regained their ``Second Ute.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, with 440 lbs./ft. of torque, it can pull 2 1/2 tons or
carry nearly half a ton in its bed. But come on, Ford builds other
trucks for those purposes. This truck is for those who want to
surprise that M3 Beemer or Saab Turbo when this hellion from the
world of the hoi polloi _ a pickup truck _ walks away from them on
the highway, leaves them outrun by what they figure is a rural
rustic, some guy or gal with grease under their nails.
</P>
<P>
   I picture this truck rolling into the parking lot at New
Hampshire International Speedway, where fans have lots of money,
where a new $85,000 S Class Mercedes would turn no heads, but this
rig would set them to swiveling.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just from the outside appearance (and subdued engine
rumble _ twin pipes peaking from beneath the passenger's side
running board) of the Ford Special Vehicle Team production.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the threatening promise of its appearance, inside
the Lightning is starkly simple. All gauges, white background with
black lettering, are in a single panel behind the wheel. At night,
it is backlit in faint green.
</P>
<P>
   All light controls are in a confined cluster to the left of the
steering column; audio controls are in a rectangle at the top
center of the dash panel; and climate controls are just below them.
</P>
<P>
   The seats in gray suede with black textured inserts are firm
beneath the thighs and grip the sides comfortably. They have the
feel of good buckets, though this is a bench seat. Granted, the
center-seat position is lumped a bit to give the bucket-seat feel
to those on either side. The driver's seat is adjustable six ways.
</P>
<P>
   The black inserts of the seats are repeated in the door panels,
and the gray of the seats themselves is matched throughout the rest
of the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Storage is not bad for a pickup, thin bins in the doors and
covered bins behind each seat.
</P>
<P>
   Because the nose of the truck dives smoothly and roundly down,
the view out the windshield is superb, as are side views out the
large side windows, made big because of the high ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Simple and comfortable for what is, in effect, a rocket sled: It
does 0-60 in about six seconds, tops out at 140 miles per hour, and
cruises effortlessly at 75 at 2,250 rpms.
</P>
<P>
   How? Let's talk technically.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a cast iron block capped with a pair of 8-valve
aluminum heads. It's got a 112-cubic inch, belt-driven Eaton blower
that delivers compressed air (cooled for better burn by an
intercooler) at somewhere between 8 and 9 psi. To handle the power,
Ford has added forged pistons and stronger wrist pins, but
remarkably has done little else to the 5.4-liter Triton engine.
</P>
<P>
   They've given it a four-speed automatic transmission _ perhaps
afraid of what all that torque might do to a standard in the wrong
hands _ and added a transmission cooler.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes it go. What makes it stop are vented disc brakes
front and rear, powered by a master cylinder plucked from the
bigger F-250. It's got ABS to keep it all in line, and 18-by-9
1/2-inch wheels fitted with Goodyear Eagle P295/45ZR18 tires to
keep it rolling.
</P>
<P>
   It's supported by a front suspension of upper and lower control
arms, coil springs, and an antiroll bar, while the back's got a
live axle, leaf springs, and antiroll bar.
</P>
<P>
   And it's remarkable how, at 4,670 pounds curb weight, the
Lightning corners so firm and true. It holds its line in sharp
curves, moving nimbly in and out of traffic. It's stiff on bumps,
but that's the price you pay. The steering is tight and quick.
</P>
<P>
   It does suck gas: just over 14 miles per gallon in about 10 days
of mostly highway driving. Good thing it has a 25-gallon gas tank.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of times, when attempting to slow gradually from a high
speed, the rear end got a bit squirrely, though I'm not sure that
more tire pressure up front might not have prevented that. Sudden
stops were no problem.
</P>
<P>
   The transmission shifted smoothly most of the time, though there
was an occasional clunk emitted when I backed off the gas in
mid-acceleration. Maybe it just doesn't want to go slow.
</P>
<P>
   Ford plans to sell just 4,000 Lightnings per year through
certified dealers. The truck is a great throwback to the past _
infused with modern technology _ and a fine toy for those who favor
thunder in their performance automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   But it does take care in driving; it is a truck with little
weight in the rear and has fearsome power. It belongs in the hands
of experienced drivers, and it is frightening to think of it in the
hands of a young driver.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The big rearview mirrors complement the giant side windows,
making it easy to see what is going on behind and beside you.
</P>
<P>
   --The fold-down back of the center seat, with its cup holder and
storage bin. You'll seldom carry three in this truck so it's a
great use of space.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The automatic locking doors. Click into gear and the locks go
down. Problem is, shut the truck down, get out of the driver's side
door and go around to the other side to pick up a package, and
you'll find that door still locked. It's a pain.
</P>
<P>
   --The windshield wipers were flimsy for such a big windshield.
Big, heavy-duty wipers should be standard on the Lightning.

THIS FALL, GET RID OF THAT ALL-BLACK CLOSET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fashion's mourning period is finally over. Bag that
head-to-toe-in-black look _ color and textured fabrics are this
fall's high notes. Reds and oranges abound, along with leather and
faux ponyskins.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis this season is not uniform dressing but
individuality, comfort, and utility. While style trends range from
hippy chic and glam rock to astronaut suiting and extreme sports,
what's most important this autumn is to express yourself. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HIDE AND CHIC
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hairy side of faux animal skins, especially pony, are hot
this year. At Filene's you can find black and white ponyskin tote
bags, hair accessories, boots, shoes, jackets, and watchbands.
Prices range from $49 for a watch to $399 for a jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pony print is a great accent,'' says Robert Rutkauskas,
Filene's fashion director. ``The trend started out because of the
need to add texture to (minimalist) wardrobes. As clothing gets
simpler, pared down, and modern looking, patterns and texture have
become more important. There are Western and bohemian influences in
fashion right now. Pony print is part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Spade is featuring seven hairy styles of faux giraffe
print, from a cosmetic clutch to a shoulder bag. Prices range from
$225 to $265. ``We really hit this season. They're blowing out of
the stores,'' says spokeswoman Susan Anthony. French Connection has
pony mules ($118), a pony skirt ($270), and _ to be introduced in
December _ a man's pony blazer ($298) and pants ($198). &QL; 
 &QL; 
WRAP IT UP
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ditch your fall coat this year. For women, it's all about the
pashmina: a large cashmere and silk scarf (36 inches by 80 inches)
with rope fringe on the ends. It comes in colors like lilac, pink,
mint green, black, and gray. ``This is the accessory of the
season,'' says Rutkauskas. ``It goes from very casual to very
dressy. It looks beautiful with a tube top or a satin ball gown.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, pashminas are an investment. Filene's offers eight
colors for $250. Neiman Marcus has 50 colors in two sizes _ 28 by
78 for $315 and 36 by 81 for $375 and $495 (this is a two-ply
cashmere). And T. J. Maxx has 30 colors for $99 to $179. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ponchos are also making a showing this year. Donna Karan's DKNY
collection includes a $295 chunky knit poncho that falls to the
mid-thigh and a $98 knit coverlet that stops at the shoulders.
``She designed them for mobility,'' says Jacqueline Mangione, a
DKNY spokeswoman. ``A poncho is not a coat (so) you don't feel so
restricted. It clings to your body but it still gives you
mobility.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger has a men's hooded leather poncho that falls just
below the knee and a clear plastic hooded version for women. ``This
goes back to taking something that is functional and putting it in
luxurious, unexpected fabric,'' says spokeswoman Courtney Moss,
referring to the leather poncho. The clear poncho is designed so
``you have the function of weather protection and you can still see
beautiful clothes underneath,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The leather poncho retails for $1,800 but Hilfiger has men's
plastic yellow ponchos for $88. The women's poncho is $68. Lord &AMP;
Taylor also has a hooded cashmere store-brand poncho, dubbed the
``ultimate little red riding hood'' in red or black for $150. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LAYER IT
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Layering is big this fall. Stores like Alan Bilzerian, Ozone,
and Anthropologie are selling aprons, to be worn over pants or
skirts. Bilzerian's range from $100 to $700 and are about
knee-length, tied around the waist. Ozone's apron is tied around
the waist and neck, falling just above the knee. In a twist, this
$55 apron is worn on one's back. Anthropologie's are tied around
the waist and fall to around the knee. They range from $38 to $58.
</P>
<P>
   Bilzerian and Ozone are also offering ``skants'' _ a
skirt-over-pants ensemble. Ozone has about four styles ranging from
$45 to $79. Bilzerian has a leather skirt attached to wool pants
for $1,045. Ozone also has skirt-over-skirt ensembles in three
styles for $55 to $65.
</P>
<P>
   Vests are another hot trend. The Gap has varieties for men and
women, including a men's $49.50 nylon fisherman's style with
zippers and velcro closures and a men's fleece style in a range of
colors for $34.50. For women, Gap has a $39.50 tightly fitted vest
in bonded fleece (like neoprene), a quilted style for $34.50, and a
leather version for $88. ``We're really standing behind vests this
year,'' says Rachel DiCarlo, a Gap spokeswoman. ``It's a really
great layering piece. It's taking us from fall through the winter
and into spring.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
SPORTS SENSATION
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sports continues to influence fashion in the forms of drawstring
waists and hems, hoods, nylon fabric, and motorcross- style
jackets. Pleated knees _ pants with indentations at the knee _ are
the latest rage, especially for men. This season, designers like
Hilfiger mixed sportswear with career wear for a dramatic
contrasting effect. His fall fashion show included a female model
in a satin skirt and fleece sweatshirt and a male model in a tweed
jacket and nylon ski pants. In his program notes, Hilfiger said he
finds that such contrast ``brings sportswear to a new level and . .
. luxury into reality.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHUNKY IS FUNKY
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sweaters this year are thick and bulky. Emporio Armani has at
least 20 different styles for men and women, including a gray
hooded version for men for $125 and a gray version with fringed
sleeves for women for $125. DKNY has one style for men and women in
about 10 colors for $245, including apple green, orange, black, and
beige. ``She believes in it,'' says Mangione, referring to Donna
Karan. ``She did chunky knit bags, knit scarves and mittens, and an
aviator hat with scarf and gloves to match. It presented a softness
. . . because it was so cozy.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
FUNNELNECK _ WHAT THE HECK?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most Bostonians own a turtleneck sweater or two, a mock
turtleneck, maybe a boat-neck sweater. Now there are funnelnecks _
funky looking sweaters whose necklines fall above the collarbone
and on the neck but don't roll over like a turtleneck. They're
different from a mock turtleneck because their collar doesn't look
stitched on as a separate unit; a funnelneck neckline is an
extension of the body of the sweater and the sweater appears to be
one knitted unit, says Filene's Rutkauskas. ``The sweater creates
an illusion of a funnel shape,'' he says. This season Filene's has
funnelnecks for men and women in cotton, wool, cashmere and other
fabric blends by DKNY, Jones of New York, Liz Claiborne, Calvin
Klein, Polo Jeans, Ralph Lauren, and Filene's own Valerie Stevens
for $29 to $125. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SKIRT THE ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For women in casual work environments, skirts and sweaters
replaced the structured pantsuit and skirted suit some time ago.
This fall, what's new about skirts is the shape. Many of them are
A-line, falling at or below the knee (the trend actually began last
spring). Many of Ann Taylor's A-line skirts are wool crepe blended
with a stretch material for comfort. They range from above the knee
to ankle-length and come in khakis, gray, green, black, and cream
for $88 to $108. ``We're making a statement with them this
season,'' says spokeswoman Lynn Willis. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GET THE BOOT
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boots are the hottest footwear for women this fall. From ankle
length to knee high, they're the perfect complement to the skirt
craze. Velcro closures, toggle ornaments, and oblique toes make the
shoes stand out, as do stretch fabrics, platform bottoms, animal
print and, in some cases, 4-inch heels. ``Attractive soles, or
bottom interest, is appealing to the masses this year,'' says
Debbie Ferree, a spokeswoman for retailer DSW Shoe Warehouse.
``Juniors love the heavier platform bottoms,'' while wedge heels
``are for the baby boomers.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOTTOMS UP
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, tops and cardigans were embellished with embroidery,
beading, and appliques in the shape of butterflies and dragonflies.
This year, the emphasis is on bottoms. Pants, jeans, and skirts
sport colorful patchwork prints, leafy appliques, and embroidery.
Anthropologie has Levi's jeans with ribbon and embroidered trims
for $178 and multicolored beaded trims for $148. Oscar de la
Renta's fall collection includes wool skirts with embroidery (about
$2,800), lace skirts with embroidered edges (about $3,000), and
velvet pants with embroidery (about $3,000). Prada's fall
collection has an olive suede A-line skirt covered with leaf
appliques, which are made of brown suede and patent leather, for
$1,990. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE NEW PINK
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brown was the new black. Gray was the new brown. Pink was the
new gray. Now white, orange, and red are the new pink. Got it?
</P>
<P>
   You'll see lots of head-to-toe white for men and women as we
head into the new millennium. Donna Karan, for one, challenges the
old adage of no white after Labor Day. Her fall DKNY collection of
80 outfits included about 26 white pieces, including boots,
jackets, shirts, and pants for men and women. Mangione said the
white look is ``part of a polar extreme, black and white. The
contrast is very modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Red, as an accent color, was embraced by designers such as
Giorgio Armani. His Emporio Armani collection includes a bright red
$345 dress, $215 red sneakers for women, and a $245 red leather
handbag. For men, he's featuring red quilted nylon and neoprene
jackets ($545 and $295, respectively) as well as red knit wool
sweaters ($295) and a mockturtle neck ($135).
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Lang has made orange a strong element in his collection.
For men and women, he is featuring orange cotton and leather pants
($800 to $835, respectively), cotton and leather coats ($1,350 and
$1,630, respectively), and cashmere sweaters ($920 to $935). ``The
whole collection was a reflection of the utility influence'' in
fashion, says spokeswoman Hannah Lawrence. ``If you consider
uniforms for astronauts or the guys who direct traffic on runway
airports _ that's where the color came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the detailing in this collection, which is so
technical and biker-oriented and uniformlike, I think orange was a
particularly appropriate color to use.''

   If there's anything odd about the just-announced merger between
Viacom and CBS, it's that it seems utterly quaint to worry about
whether the concentration of so many cable, radio, network TV and
Internet assets in one company is the best thing for the free flow
of information in a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   FCC regulations may require the new Viacom to sell a few of its
TV stations--because there's a rule saying one company can't own
stations that serve more than 35 percent of the United States--and
to either spin off or fold in the still-struggling UPN. But for all
intents and purposes, the $35 billion deal is done.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about whether it should have been done, you end
up confronting again a central paradox of the media business today:
The more fragmented audiences and consumer markets become, the more
important scale appears to be. That's true both because the larger
you are, the easier it is for you to re-purpose content across many
different platforms (how's that for a jargon-laden clause) and the
easier it is for you to promote that content in many different
places.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the ability to distribute content (and advertising)
is probably as important as the ability to produce content, and
even though in the age of the Internet and 95-channel cable systems
you'd think anyone can get a message out there, successful
distribution is still basically all about aggregating lots of
people.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, CBS could do that just by broadcasting ``All In
the Family.'' Today, it has to use its radio stations, its
billboards, its TV stations and its broadcasts. But the fact that
it can use all those different outlets is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you could think of this as synergy. And certainly Sumner
Redstone, CEO of Viacom, likes that idea, as evidenced by things
like Simon &AMP; Schuster's selling MTV books, Paramount's releasing
``The Rugrats'' movie, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But in a way Redstone's ``content is king'' refrain seems a bit
old-school next to the ``distribution is king'' refrain of Mel
Karmazin, who is head of CBS and will be the operational head of
the new Viacom.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone has done an excellent job of managing Viacom in the
past couple of years, selling off assets, paying down debt, and
generally focusing the company on its core operations. But it's
Karmazin, who will be president and chief operating officer of the
new company, who's really essential to Viacom's future, because
it's Karmazin who recognizes that no matter what you make, if
people don't see it or hear it, it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin's relentless focus on shareholder value and his
essential frugality as an executive have long distinguished him
from the media moguls--like Redstone--who spent much of the '80s
and early '90s borrowing huge sums of money to make questionable
acquisitions and engage in hostile takeover battles.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin came to CBS from radio chain Infinity Broadcasting
(which CBS still owns), and brought to CBS a measure of economic
rigor that for a long time was hard to find in the media business.
</P>
<P>
   When you listen to Karmazin, you get the feeling you're
listening to someone who thinks that media companies should be
judged by the same economic and business standards as other
companies, as opposed to someone who thinks that media companies
should be valued by the grandiosity of their dreams. Needless to
say, this is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, though, is that while Karmazin is the new-model media
exec (``mogul'' being a word that doesn't fit), one of his greatest
strengths is his ability to recognize the value of the seemingly
mundane. Radio and outdoor advertising, for instance, are
incredibly un-glamorous. But they're also fast-growing markets
(unlike, for example, television or even the movies), and Karmazin
has ensured that CBS has reaped great benefits from them.
</P>
<P>
   Local TV stations are similarly boring, but while they are not
the cash cows they once were, they're still very profitable, and
Karmazin has agitated (successfully) for a relaxation of federal
regulations to allow CBS to own more than one station in a given
market.
</P>
<P>
   Cable is not a booming business--though it may be in the future
once we all go to digital cable--but it is a profitable one, and
this deal gives Karmazin a host of cable networks to play with. All
mergers should, given the historical record, be greeted with
skepticism. But in acquiring the rights to Karmazin's services and
CBS's assets, Sumner Redstone may have made the best decision of
his business career.

HEALTHY EATING STARTS YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the moment a toddler graduates from baby food to table
food, the typical parent turns into the food police. Has he had
enough protein? Did she get her vitamins? Did he eat enough?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder we end up pushing food on our kids any way we can:
``How 'bout just three peas, sweetie? For Momma?'' ``Here comes the
airplane; it's got peas coming to your hangar!'' ``You can't get
down from this high chair until you eat those peas!''
</P>
<P>
   But sweet-talk, games, and threats only create trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we push, the less they eat,'' says family therapist
Ellyn Satter, an author and internationally recognized specialist
on child nutrition and eating disorders. Her philosophy is that
parents are responsible for what, when, and where a child eats, but
it's up to the child to decide how much or whether she eats at all.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like a recipe for disaster rather than for good
nutrition, but years of research bear it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as your child has been to the pediatrician, is healthy
and growing well . . . all we need to do is present a balanced diet
in a pleasant setting at scheduled snack- and mealtime. Then a
child will eat the proper things in the proper amount, over time,''
says Brunswick, Maine, pediatrician William G. Wilkoff, author of
``Coping with a Picky Eater'' (Fireside).
</P>
<P>
   It's the ``over time'' part that's so tricky. Parents tend to
judge a child's eating from meal to meal rather than day to day or
even week to week. The crazier we get _ and if you cook three foods
a meal because your 2-year-old refuses the first and then the
second and maybe even the third one, you're at the top of Wilkoff's
crazy list _ the more we feed into the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We become enablers for poor eating, and it can last for
years,'' he says, potentially leading to an eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
   He tells parents that by 15 months, a child should be served the
same food we serve ourselves, at the same time we eat. ``The meal
as a family event is important for socialization,'' says Wilkoff.
``As a source of nutrition, it's important for a balanced diet; the
less we cater to what we think they will eat, the less likely they
become picky eaters.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Early habits matter &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early food habits are more important than we may realize. It's
in the first three years that a child develops subconscious
feelings about foods and eating in general, says nutritional
scientist Susan B. Roberts, a professor at Tufts University and
specialist in childhood nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important time for influencing food
preferences. It's almost as if a child is developing a blueprint
for what's appropriate and what isn't,'' she says. Research shows,
for instance, that children who don't get sugar in the first year
like it less later on and voluntarily eat less sugary food.
Roberts's daughter, Diana, who is 6, is a good example.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's far more likely to refuse pastry and pie than I am,''
says Roberts. ``It wasn't made available to her when she was little
so it isn't part of her vision of good food, whereas it was
definitely part of mine. I gobble it down.'' Roberts is coauthor of
``Feeding Your Child for Lifelong Health'' (Bantam).
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean no sweets? And what about salty snacks that kids
love so much?
</P>
<P>
   Roberts always has one kind of relatively plain cookie in the
house (the more variety you have, the more likely a child is to
overeat) and she doesn't object to chips in moderation (she prefers
corn chips because they tend to be whole grain). Wilkoff prefers
serving fruit for dessert, but says even a sweet dessert a day
balances out along with everything else offered in a week. (He
makes exception for a picky eater or an overweight child.)
</P>
<P>
   What becomes a problem nutritionally and behaviorally is
offering any food in excess or holding it out as a reward.
``Saying, `You only get dessert if you eat your veggie,' is what
gets you an overweight kid,'' says Satter. ``She eats more than
she's hungry for at the meal, and then dessert on top of that.''
She recommends putting dessert on the table with the meal so it
isn't used as leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when we offer only what we think he will eat _
macaroni five times a week or cereal three times a day _ not only
do we narrow the blueprint but we also put him at risk
nutritionally. ``If you only offer one food, he will only choose
one food,'' says Wilkoff. ``Even if it's a healthy food, it's an
unbalanced diet.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Developmental stages &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How your child eats depends partly on stage of development:
</P>
<P>
   --6 to 12 months. As she makes the transition to solid food,
there's a developmental shift to wanting to feed herself. This is
so exciting to a baby that she cares more about the process of
doing it than about eating. The more we try to wrest control, the
more upset she'll become, eating even less. ``As long as she is
either nursing or taking formula, don't worry about how much finger
food is making it into her mouth,'' says Satter.
</P>
<P>
   --12 to 24 months. The need for separation fuels oppositional
behavior of all kinds, including rejecting food just to see your
reaction. But there's something else going on, too: ``Just
yesterday if you put something new on the tray, he might put it in
his mouth,'' says Satter. ``Now, literally overnight, he won't. He
can recognize that it's not familiar and he's wary.'' Continue to
offer it anyway; it takes 15 times of mouthing a food before it
becomes familiar and countless more exposure before he'll even
mouth it. In other words, weeks, months, maybe more of patient
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts's strategy for making the unfamiliar familiar is to give
a child two plates: ``Plate No. 1 is what you definitely want to
eat; Plate No. 2 is what you don't want. It's there just in case
you change your mind.'' Wilkoff cautions against insisting a child
try something, telling him instead, ``You don't have to eat
anything you don't like.'' Make it clear at the same time, however,
that the choices for this meal are only what's already on the table
and that there will be no snack 20 minutes after dinner.
</P>
<P>
   --24 to 36 months: Offering choices of foods is too much for
toddlers to handle and increases potential for the control game
that Wilkoff hates so much, where you cook something he's asked for
only to have him reject it. Better to just put food on the table,
knowing there's at least one thing he likes (bread and butter is
usually foolproof). If he leaves without a bite, it's OK. ``Trust
that it will balance out,'' says Satter. This is also the age to
begin to stress the social aspects of mealtime: ``You don't have to
eat the food if you don't want to, but at least sit and keep us
company.''
</P>
<P>
   --4 years: Preschoolers are very susceptible to feeling badly
about themselves if they perceive they let you down by not eating.
Avoid comparisons to a sibling _ ``Look what a good job your
brother did!'' _ or shaming him: ``I can't believe a child in this
family wouldn't like linguica!'' Preschoolers are also highly
imitative, which makes them more likely to eat something just
because you do but also more susceptible to peer influence. ``If
you know her best friend doesn't eat anything green, don't serve
green food at your house when she's visiting,'' says Roberts.
``Otherwise she'll hear the rap against green foods.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she tells parents not to worry about what he
does or doesn't eat at other houses: ``Kids are able to be
place-specific about food. When she goes to Alexa's, she may ask
for Gummy Bears because she had them there before, but if you never
keep them at home, she won't even think about them there.'' If she
does, instead of I-can't-believe-you-ate-that, tell her, ``In our
house, we don't eat Gummy Bears.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Consistency pays &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest challenge for parents is refusing to feed a
child who's hungry because he didn't eat at meal- or snack time.
``Once you give in, especially with a picky eater, you're in
trouble because he won't be hungry at dinner,'' says Satter.
</P>
<P>
   Equally problematic is a parent who only makes a meal when a
child says he's hungry. ``If he can't trust that dinner will be
served, either because a parent is overworked, disorganized, or
observing a strict diet, it's scary,'' Satter says. ``He worries he
isn't going to get fed so he eats as much as he can when he can.
That leads to obesity.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Children 12 to 36 months eat worse than at any other age.
</P>
<P>
   --Some toddlers drink so much juice they aren't hungry for food.
By 18 months, offer water any time but limit juice and milk to
snack- and mealtimes.
</P>
<P>
   --Offer snack at the same time each day so he knows when to
expect it: after morning nap, when Sam comes home from school.
</P>
<P>
   --It's normal for a child to skip a meal now and then.
</P>
<P>
   --A child who isn't hungry for breakfast may be snacking too
close to bedtime or not having enough time in the morning to work
up a hunger. He also may have a nighttime postnasal drip that
interferes with appetite. Talk to your pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   --Make food a nonissue at the dinner table. Especially don't
discuss who's eating what.
</P>
<P>
   --If your spouse consistently can't be home for a family meal,
sit and eat a small meal with your children anyway, even if you're
saving your appetite to eat later with your partner.
</P>
<P>
   --Set reasonable rules for mealtime behavior that are
appropriate to each child's stage of development: No one can
interfere with someone else's eating but a toddler may leave the
table when he's finished while the 7-year-old waits until everyone
is done. (If the older child balks, tell him he was allowed to
leave the table when he was that age.)
</P>
<P>
   --The more you include a child in conversation at the table, the
more fun dinner will be and the longer he'll stay at the table.
That increases his exposure to unfamiliar foods, to eating better,
and to you as a role model of an eater with good manners.
</P>
<P>
   --When you try a new food, make a point of drawing attention to
it. Be honest: ``I still don't love it, but it's much better than I
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
AFTERTHOUGHT: Avoid the proverbial ``How-was-school-today? Fine''
conversation by asking specific and direct questions: ``Tell me
something new you learned in math.'' ``What questions did you ask
in class?'' ``Did you start a new book in reading?'' &QL; 
 &QL;

COVERING SOME GROUND ON THE SHADY SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With September arrives the year's second planting season, more
relaxed than frenetic spring, a time more to savor what has been
rather than worry about what's to come.
</P>
<P>
   In our garden, we'll be putting in a phalanx of bulbs, tulips
mainly, a replacement for a hyacinthiflora lilac, some fountain
grasses, a little of this, a couple of that.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it goes, this and that, here and there, sometimes a
plan, sometimes not. I think we need a flax somewhere, just to get
to know the blue-flowering perennial, and so I shall have it.
</P>
<P>
   What makes such a garden work, if work it does, is planning, but
absent that, or even with that, ground covers can perform yeoman
service in tying pieces into a whole.
</P>
<P>
   There are sheets of ivy, juniper rugs, ripples of ajuga, waves
of day lilies. Large and small, the ill-defined ground cover makes
sense of our folly and further rewards us by easing our labors. By
and large, there's not a lot of work to maintaining these thickets.
</P>
<P>
   But what about shade? ``There is more and more of it around,''
Russ Bragg said, citing the return of the forest and maturation of
trees around homes. I asked Bragg, who operates Underwood Shade
Nursery from his North Attleborough, Mass. home, to recommend some
ground covers for shade. After tramping around his property, he
came up with 10 winners.
</P>
<P>
   What caught his eye especially was partridgeberry, Mitchella
repens, a low creeper with round, half-inch leaves that are deep
green with whitish veins and paired tubular flowers in June. Those
white flowers, Bragg noted, share one ovary, and form a fused,
single red berry with two ``belly buttons.'' Ah, nature. It likes
moist soil in shady woods, ``and yet at the same time I've seen it
in places where it gets midday sun,'' and it has withstood the
drought just fine, he said. It roots from leaf nodes and can simply
be peeled up if it goes where unwanted. ``It's not common in the
nursery trade, but it's fairly common around here in the woods,''
Bragg said. ``We have some that we rescued from a construction
project, a big sod of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragg also listed asarums as good ground covers for shade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see more and more of those,'' he said. ``There are a
lot that are coming from China and Japan, and uncommon ones from
southern Appalachia are getting into the trade.'' The European wild
ginger, Asarum europaeum, is seen more and more. I have it and love
it. It is evergreen, with deep, glossy green leaves, and is pretty
slug resistant. I also grow the larger-leafed native Asarum
canadensis, which Bragg said is ``deciduous, cold hardy, but it
does get chewed up.''
</P>
<P>
   In New England fields and meadows, wood anemone, Anemone
quinquefolia, grows low in patches with one-inch white flowers
above toothed, palmate leaves. It is a spring ephemeral, blooming
in May and gone, dormant, by the Fourth of July. Pair it with
leadwort, Ceratostigma plumbaginoides, which has lovely blue
flowers and doesn't emerge until summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg really likes Chimaphila maculata: ``If you have it, it's
great, and if you don't have it it's tough to get hold of.'' It has
whorls of lance-shaped leaves, up to 3 inches long, striped white
along the veins. ``I haven't figured out how you propagate it yet,
but it's very hardy, a native plant, leathery leaves that are lamp
shaped, deep green, little white flowers,'' he said. ``It's very
tough in the woods, likes moist woodlands. If you're lucky enough
to have it, don't dig it up is all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Epimediums, barrenwort, are tough and long-lived, and more are
being introduced all the time. Epimedium X youngianum ``Roseum''
has pink flowers in racemes held above the leaves. ``They have
really cool leaves, eccentric spoons,'' Bragg said. ``The leaves
are not bilaterally symmetrical.''
</P>
<P>
   While Galium odoratum, sweet woodruff, is no trendy newcomer,
``it is an excellent ground cover, very vigorous, that can be
invasive,'' Bragg said. It has small white flowers in spring,
whorls of narrow leaves, and the scent of new-mown hay. Mmm.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Tiarella cordifolia, foamflower. ``That's found
throughout the East, a wonderful plant that likes fairly moist
conditions,'' Bragg told me. ``It likes to be in shady woods in
moist soil, though I've found that it does all right in a good deal
of sun.'' It puts up bottlebrush flowers in spring. It travels by
runners and can cover a lot of ground, but there are some clumping
cultivars, such as T. wherryi, which I have next to some grasslike
liriope.
</P>
<P>
   Linnaea borealis, twinflower, grows in the Arctic, creeping
along on runners with half-inch leaves and putting up a pair of
pink tubular flowers in early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Meehania cordata is a creeping ground cover, somewhat along the
line of phlox, runners with stems, glossy dark green leaves, and
1-inch tubular blue flowers. It does not seem to get the powdery
mildew that the phloxes do.
</P>
<P>
   Viola labradorica, a creeping violet with deep green leaves
tinged purple for a bronzy effect, has the typical violet-blue
flowers, smallish, which appear in the spring, then sporadically
throughout the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Note that these plants are native woodlanders. Bragg was a
certified arborist working for a tree service when he built his
home in the woods in 1989 and was faced with shade. So he joined
the New England Wild Flower Society and started taking courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory was, at least when we were landscaping our own
place, try to go with the things that are native here, because they
are the easiest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the job, people were always asking about shade,
``and I was getting a little old to keep climbing trees.'' The
nursery followed, in 1994, and has become a full-time business,
mainly mail order (call ahead to visit or for a catalog,
508-222-2164), but also with clients ranging from local landscapers
to the New York City Parks Department.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg has covered a lot of ground.

YOU DON'T NEED A PH.D. TO SAVE ENERGY AND HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chemistry and physics. These little words pack a big wallop,
sending shivers of terror up the spines of the unscientific student
who has to take one or other other.
</P>
<P>
   In my adolescent terror, I opted for chemistry and flunked it
faster than anyone else ever at Sault High School. Many years later
I thought I would have done better in physics; at least you can see
what physics does. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   But it is physics that makes our homes live and breathe, heating
them in winter, cooling them in summer, and making life a little
easier. A little knowledge of physics is a good thing, in this
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best-kept secrets is that physics is actually
fun,'' says Louis A. Bloomfield, Ph.D., a physics (of course)
professor at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basic physics concepts are behind everything we do, and the
way we heat, cool, and light our homes is a great example of the
role that physics plays in our daily lives,'' said Bloomfield.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you are looking for ways to save energy, reduce bills,
or just learn basic concepts, physics can answer many common home
energy questions.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Help! Downstairs it's freezing in winter, upstairs it's like
a sauna.
</P>
<P>
   A. The physics here is that hot air rises and cool air falls. A
ceiling fan at the top of the stairs will not only blow heat back
downstairs, it will warm the air as it blows it. Moving air
``excites'' the atoms, which adds energy, raising its temperature.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I stop my windows from letting in light and heat?
</P>
<P>
   A. Visible sunlight pass easily through windows, and so does
invisible light, which contains most of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are using this knowledge to develop windows that
reflect heat back into a house in winter, and reduce heat gain in
the house during summer. These low-emissivity or ``low-E'' windows
can reduce energy loss through the window.
</P>
<P>
   This is good and practical, but low-E windows are double-glazed,
a common component of new windows and replacement windows.
</P>
<P>
   This increased efficiency is not necessarily a reason to run out
and get replacement windows. If your windows are double-glazed or
are single-glazed with storms, there is no need for replacement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I prevent heat buildup in the summer?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most of the heat that comes into the house from sunlight is
absorbed through the roof, walls, and windows. Dark-colored
exteriors absorb more heat than light-colored ones; that heat is
then transferred into the house by conduction.
</P>
<P>
   Since light-colored surfaces reflect heat away from the house,
would it pay to coat the roof with a light or white finish, or
install light-colored shingles?
</P>
<P>
   In Southern areas, absolutely. But such treatment is not always
necessary in Northern parts of the country, and therefore there is
no need for a light-colored roof, especially if the attic under the
roof is well ventilated.
</P>
<P>
   Wall surfaces are less critical in absorbing heat, so if you
have a dark brown stained house, or a dark green, or dark gray, or
any other dark color, and you happen to like that color, there is
no need to run out and change it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why are light bulbs so hot? And brother, they get mighty hot.
</P>
<P>
   A. Standard incandescent light bulbs are actually better sources
of heat than of light, because they produce light the same way the
sun does: with a white-hot surface. Unfortunately, most of the
energy leaving the bulb's hot tungsten filament doesn't leave as
visible light; it leaves as invisible infrared light or hot air.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do the new, modern light bulbs last so long?
</P>
<P>
   A. Modern efficient light is based on the goal of producing
light without producing wasted heat first. Skipping the heat step
allows these lamps to be more energy-efficient than incandescent
bulbs, but it can lead to less appealing light.
</P>
<P>
   New compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) use rare-earth phosphor
coatings to produce a more pleasing white light. While CFLs are
more expensive, they last up to 10 times longer (9,000 to 20,000
hours) and use just 25 to 35 percent of the energy of typical
incandescent bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not necessary to lighten your roof and/or walls to
reflect heat, or buy replacement windows, it will pay to replace
your incandescents with fluorescents.
</P>
<P>
   Just make sure the new compact bulbs fit in your lamps and
fixtures; some may be too big to do so. But with a little measuring
and a good memory, you can solve this problem, too.
</P>
<P>
   And you don't even need a doctorate in physics.

MARCELLO MASTROIANNI: THE `LAZY'STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The late Marcello Mastroianni was fond of describing himself as
a lazy man who enjoyed playing weak men. It was part of his light
throwaway charm, part of his worldliness. Life was too short to
take things too seriously, he would say. What was the point, he
would ask rhetorically, with a shrug and a smile, and light up
another cigarette. No, he once explained patiently to an
interviewer, he never discussed his roles in the films of Federico
Fellini, for whom he was to become a cinematic alter ego. Once he
tried, he said, and Fellini, who got his start as a cartoonist,
responded by drawing a picture of a man fishing from a boat.
Except, Mastroianni explained with a sly twinkle in his eye, the
cartoon figure wasn't using a fishing pole. He was using his much
elongated reproductive organ, dangling it into the water, trolling.
Further discussion with Fellini seemed redundant, Mastroianni
added.
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about the rich 19-film Mastroianni
retrospective, currently at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, is the
way it gently moves beneath the facade to remind us that the
self-styled lazy man made more than 170 films and had a range much
greater than the archetype of charming superficiality and exhausted
hedonism he fashioned into a mid-century icon. ``La Dolce Vita''
(1960) and ``8 1/2'' (1963) rightly give us the Mastroianni best
known abroad _ a glitz-addicted butterfly constantly allowing
himself to be pulled away from serious purpose until, at the end,
in ``Ginger and Fred,'' there was nothing left but a pathetic
remnant of empty charm that could scarcely bear comparison to the
dignity and emotional integrity of Fellini's wife, the great
Giulietta Masina.
</P>
<P>
   Mastroianni's suave image of bewildered, unexamined alienation
was reinforced in such other films as Mauro Bolognini's ``Il Bell'
Antonio'' (1960) and Michelangelo Antonioni's ``La Notte'' (1961),
to almost as much international acclaim. But his best role came as
a man of stubborn purposefulness in Mario Monicelli's ``The
Organizer'' (1963), a period piece in which he played a nondescript
clarinet-playing schoolteacher turned labor organizer in Turin,
projecting fierce inner strength from beneath an almost recessive
appearance. He was able to transcend the soap opera of Ettore
Scola's ``A Special Day'' (1977) by again playing a man unheroic on
the outside but strong on the inside, an ostracized homosexual who
for a single day bonds and exchanges tenderness with an equally
disenfranchised neighbor, a housewife played by Sophia Loren.
</P>
<P>
   Mastroianni and Loren liked each other. They made a dozen films
together, which put them neck and neck with Tracy and Hepburn as
postwar film's most illustrious couple. Their collaboration began
with ``Too Bad She's Bad'' (1955) in which he plays a dumb taxi
driver who finds Loren and her family of thieves running rings
around him. She does little more than plant her hands on her hips,
sway a little bit, roll her eyes at his naivete, and focus on
something outside the frame, as if to emphasize his limited vision.
But that's all she needs to do. Vittorio De Sica, who later starred
them in ``Marriage Italian-Style'' (1964), gave the young
Mastroianni charm lessons as Loren's larcenous father, as suavely
attuned to the energies of farce as to the Roman netherworld of
snatch-and-grab thievery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage Italian-Style'' is another sunny farce that involves
Loren's longtime mistress scheming to get Mastroianni's wayward
Neapolitan to marry her after enjoying her outside marriage for
years. The humor was more wicked and more brilliant in its needling
of macho Sicilian ways and antiquated divorce laws in Pietro
Germi's ``Divorce _ Italian Style'' (1961). The title refers to the
practice of getting rid of unwanted spouses by killing them,
labeling the murders as crimes of passion, and assuming that the
courts would impose only the lightest of sentences, leaving the
killers free to remarry in a land that forbade divorce. Mastroianni
plays against his sophisticated persona as an oily Sicilian baron
drooling over his neighbor (Stefania Sandrelli) and bringing a
blackly hilarious combination of arrogance and ignorance to his
murder scheme, punctuated by an increasing number of facial tics.
</P>
<P>
   Mastroianni's characters were rarely controlling men, even when
the projects grew more ambitious. In Mario Bellochio's ``Henry IV''
(1984), Mastroianni reminded the world that he enjoyed a
distinguished stage career concurrent with his film work, playing
the seemingly delusional hero of Luigi Pirandello's play about
reality, insanity, and truths that transcend both. He had been
playing stage roles for 10 years when he starred in Luchino
Visconti's ``White Nights'' (1957). Although the setting is
contemporary, and the film is in Italian, the stylized
Expressionistic settings, with their cramped streets and networks
of bridges, suggest a foggy St. Petersburg of the mind, where
Mastroianni's lonely man meets a girl he loves but finds himself
competing with the memory of her first lover. Maria Schell, who
played the girl with a radiance that indicated she was looking
forward to sainthood through renunciation, went on to play the
similarly self-abnegating Grushenka in Hollywood's ``Brothers
Karamazov.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years before Lina Wertmuller arrived with the
desert-island comedy ``Swept Away,'' Marco Ferrari starred
Mastroianni alongside Catherine Deneuve in ``Liza'' (1972), the
Italian title of which is ``La Cagna.'' It means ``The Bitch,'' and
is intended literally, although the stylized comedy is anything but
realistic. In it, Deneuve plays a woman washed up on the beach of
the Mediterranean island retreat of cartoonist Mastroianni, who's
doing the Robinson Crusoe bit, but with no serious inconvenience,
just a desire to get away form his wife and family. He lives in a
stone igloo with all the conveniences and has a motor launch to get
him back and forth to the nearby port. When Deneuve's Liza arrives,
it's goodbye serenity. In a fit of jealousy, she kills his dog and
volunteers to take its place, donning the dog's collar, fetching
sticks, nuzzling the cartoonist, grateful for any scrap of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Even this most unreconstructed macho view of the way things
ought to go has a horseshoe up its sleeve for the cartoonist. The
film doesn't really jell, and its color now is as faded as its
thinking. It remains at best a curio. Offscreen, Deneuve and
Mastroianni hit it off. Mastroianni lived long enough to star
alongside their now grown daughter, Chiara, who combines her
mother's beauty with her father's clown face, ever alert for any
reason at all to break into laughter. Mastroianni's brother,
Ruggero, is listed as editor for many of the films. He was a
respected one, but he always wanted to act. He finally got the
chance in another rarity on the series, Luigi Magni's political
satire, ``Scipio the African'' (1971). Marcello played the title
role. Ruggero played Scipio the Asian. Ruggero died three months
before Marcello in 1996.

   Schools and colleges are back in session and you are a young
driver _ or the parents of a young driver. Kids listen to music in
a way they don't always listen to their parents. It has ever been
thus.
</P>
<P>
   When they get behind the wheel, they might have too many kids in
the car with them. They might get distracted while fiddling with
the sound system. They might be distracted by friends who, not
wearing seat belts, cavort and lean over the front seat. They might
behave as adults _ impatient and filled with road rage. They might
be drunk or drugged. It has ever been thus.
</P>
<P>
   Kids listen to music, so this fall, I'd recommend that young
drivers, or their parents, make a tape, a tape of car-wreck songs.
Then play it while you drive and think about the ripples that
emanate, to family, lovers, friends, and community every time a
young person dies in a crash.

 &HT;    Michael J. Fox was a television star at 20, a movie star at 25,
supposedly washed up at 30 and a comeback sensation at 35.
 &HT;    That would be enough drama for most people's whole lives, but at
38 the actor is battling Parkinson's disease.

admits. ``It's never stopped me doing anything I wanted to do, but
now I'm taking life one day at a time.''
 &HT;    Fox doesn't volunteer to discuss Parkinson's, a crippling and
incurable nerve disorder, but he doesn't mind talking about it and
its implications for his career _ and for his hit political comedy
``Spin City,'' which returns to ABC on Sept. 21 for its fourth
season.
 &HT;    Although he admits that his illness makes him tire more easily,
Fox insists that he plans to continue working on the show for at
least another two years. After that, though _ which would give him
six years on ``Spin City'' to go with seven on his 1980s hit
``Family Ties'' _ he doesn't expect to tackle another series.
 &HT;    ``I'd love to do this show for as many years as I did `Family
Ties,''' Fox says. ``Then I want to write the great American novel
and sit on a beach somewhere. In terms of films, maybe I'll produce
_ I'd love to do a series for my wife.''
 &HT;    The slender, 5-foot-4-inch, Canadian-born actor shows up for an
interview in Pasadena, Calif., sporting a neatly trimmed beard and
moustache, wearing a smart business suit, tie and heavy black
shoes.
 &HT;    He downplays his illness, but it obviously plays a major part in
everything he does these days. Always energetic, at moments he acts
a bit overwrought, and his left leg seems to have a will of its own
_ perhaps from tremors, perhaps simply from edginess.
 &HT;    But Fox isn't looking for sympathy. Never has, never will.
 &HT;    The terrible irony, of course, is that Fox, who complained for
years that he looked too much like a kid and even into his late 20s
was too baby-faced to land mature roles, is now suffering from the
``old man's disease.''
 &HT;    It's extremely unusual for men under 40 to contract Parkinson's,
doctors say, and most sufferers are at least 50. Fox was 37 in
1998, when he publicly revealed that he had suffered from
Parkinson's for seven years.
 &HT;    ``This has been a kind of maturation for me,'' he says. ``I was
in my early 30s, my father had just passed away. There was a lot of
other stuff it hastened in terms of wanting to really plan life on
a day-to-day basis and make the most of a lot of things.''
 &HT;    This new phase in his life began eight years ago, when he woke
up one morning with his little finger twitching and was unable to
stop it. He didn't think it was serious, but when it wouldn't go
away he went to see a specialist who gave him the brutal diagnosis.
 &HT;    He kept it quiet for years _ which, some friends say, may have
contributed to the severe drinking problem which resulted in his
early-1990s stay in a rehab clinic.
 &HT;    Now he's learning to live with the affliction, even though there
has been some deterioration since he went public in December. He
underwent brain surgery in l998 to try to relieve some of the more
severe symptoms, and relies on various new drugs to retard the
progress of a disease which, as yet, has no cure.
 &HT;    ``I respect the fear of anyone who has it,'' he admits. ``I had
no problem with the brain surgery. It was something I wanted. I had
tremendous faith in my doctor, faith in the science. I just knew it
would be OK. Once you make the decision to do it, I felt it was OK.
 &HT;    ``I feel pretty good on a day-to-day basis,'' he says. ``You
monitor it daily and treat it therapeutically. I can't treat it
curatively at this point, although I hope that happens.
 &HT;    ``I'm following all the medical developments pretty closely,''
the actor adds. ``I think there will be a time in the future _
maybe two or three years down the road, after `Spin City' _ when I
think it will probably be my sole concern and my sole activity.
 &HT;    ``There's tremendous research being done, in surgery, in
fetal-cell stuff and genetic stuff. So you know something could pop
at any moment. There's a lot of people working in labs on this.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, he says, Parkinson's has not yet significantly
interfered with his acting. He looks forward to the new season of
``Spin City,'' reinvigorated by the arrival of ``Melrose Place's''
Heather Locklear. She plays the ambitious campaign manager for
Fox's boss, New York's fictional Mayor Winston (Barry Bostwick),
who this season _ not unlike his real-life counterpart, Rudolph
Giuliani _ decides to run for the U.S. Senate.
 &HT;    ``I feel confident with my ability to do my job,'' Fox says.
``That was clear to me last year.''
 &HT;    But Parkinson's has cost him what he calls his dream role.
Producer Robert Halmi Sr., a close friend of Hollywood legend James
Cagney, wanted Fox for a movie version of the actor/dancer's life.
 &HT;    ``It would be hard to do now,'' Fox says regretfully. ``But I
never saw myself as a good enough dancer to do it. I don't even
know if I could handle the rest of his persona _ but even if I
could, dance was such a big part of who he was that, if you don't
know how to do it, then you feel like an idiot.''
 &HT;    Fox has planned this season of ``Spin City'' to allow him a few
days off in the middle of the week to be with his wife of 11 years,
actress Tracy Pollan, their 10-year-old son Sam and their
3-year-old twin daughters, Aquinnah and Schuyler.
 &HT;    ``My greatest accomplishment in my life is my children,'' he
says proudly. ``I love doing the show, but I use every bit of my
time off to be with them from March until August. My life has been
so filled with positives and blessings and things I'd never ever
trade.''
 &HT;    And there's nothing like being diagnosed with a potentially
fatal disease to alter priorities, even those of an actor who was
once notorious for his drive and ambition, who leveraged his teen
stardom on ``Family Ties'' into big-screen success in three ``Back
to the Future'' movies in 1985, l989 and l990, as well as such
other films as ``Casualties of War'' (l989) and ``The American
President'' (l996).
 &HT;    ``Obviously this has changed me a lot,'' he says. ``I'm
different from the way I was 10 or 15 years ago. I don't have
gigantic ambitions. I don't want to take over the world, and I
don't need to be the star of a huge-budgeted movie.
 &HT;    ``I have a nice job I really love and it pays me well,'' Fox
concludes. ``It allows me to be with my family and do things for my
kids.
 &HT;    ``What I hope for them is to enjoy life and have a good time _
just what you would want for your children, so they'll be happy and
find a path in life and not be knocked off it.''

POTTER BEATING THE DICKENS OUT OF SOME CLASSICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once there was a girl who refused to read the Harry Potter
books.
</P>
<P>
   All her friends read Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   They read ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' in which
Harry discovers his true identity, leaves his miserable Muggle aunt
and uncle and enrolls at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   They read ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,'' in which
Harry returns for his second year at Hogwarts and thwarts the
insidious schemes of the evil Lord Voldemort.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't wait to read ``Harry Potter and The Prisoner of
Azkaban,'' just published and supposedly even better than the first
two.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's friends talked about Harry Potter, and they asked her
why she wouldn't read the books. She told them she had nothing
against Harry Potter, but first she wanted to finish reading ``A
Wrinkle in Time.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl's parents worried because she wouldn't read Harry
Potter. What's wrong with her? they asked each other late at night,
during commercial breaks. How will she get along in the world? How
will she fit in?
</P>
<P>
   They read Harry Potter. Her father said he wished the books had
been around when he was a boy, maybe he would have learned to like
reading novels. Her mother said the books were just what all the
callers to ``The Connection'' had said they were. Magical.
Enchanting. Funny. Why did her daughter refuse to read them?
</P>
<P>
   When the girl's parents got together with other parents they all
talked about how much they loved the Harry Potter books. They all
agreed that the author, J.K. Rowling, is a genius and that it's
wonderful that she's inspiring children to read.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's parents didn't mention that their daughter was the
only one in her class who hadn't read Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   One night, they saw a psychologist on TV who said that the Harry
Potter books were a priceless opportunity for family bonding. She
said parents and children should read the books together and then
talk about the nature of good and evil, justice and mercy, right
and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the girl's parents tried to explain to her that if
she would only read Harry Potter they could bond together as a
family and talk about crucial life issues. ``Later, maybe,'' the
girl said, ``after I finish reading `Great Expectations'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that?'' her father asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a novel,'' the girl said, ``by Charles Dickens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And you could be reading Harry Potter,'' her father said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's little brother read Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know why your sister won't,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weirdo,'' said the little brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't talk about your sister like that,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother suggested to her that maybe if she'd read
Harry Potter she and her little brother could talk about the books
instead of fighting all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' the girl said, ``after I finish `The Catcher in the
Rye.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This alarmed her mother, who remembered reading ``The Catcher in
the Rye'' when she was in high school. She took her daughter to the
family doctor for a diagnosis of her reading habits. The doctor
said it was just the start of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she's only 11,'' her mother said, ``she should be reading
Harry Potter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' the doctor said, ``she'll have plenty of time
to read Harry Potter when she has children of her own.''

THE SIMPLE PLEASURES OF A JAPANESE INN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOTO, Japan _ The sewing kit came in a dainty red and white
patterned cardboard box, slipped into a red and gold brocade pocket
with a minuscule bone fastener.
</P>
<P>
   Packaging is of paramount importance in the Japanese aesthetic,
and full immersion in that aesthetic was what I was seeking when I
checked into a ryokan, a traditional inn. It's the closest most
Westerners come to a centuries-old Japanese lifestyle, one made up
of hundreds of exquisite details: that sewing kit; the closet lined
in calligraphy-printed paper; the tiny red lacquer tray, carved to
look like tree bark, whose only function is to hold a golden towel
for you to wash your hands.
</P>
<P>
   I picked the ryokan of the stars, Tawaraya, where I. M. Pei
stayed while he was designing the Miho Museum outside Kyoto, where
the guest list has included the king of Sweden, Rudolf Nureyev,
Leonard Bernstein, Alfred Hitchcock, and now me. It was a sinfully
expensive experience _ about $400 a night _ so I had to use the
cheaper-than-therapy rationale. It was partly the cost, partly the
charm, that made me decide to savor Tawaraya as fully as possible.
So I spent an entire 24 hours in the meandering little complex just
off one of Kyoto's busiest boulevards, not venturing outside at
all. I slept on the floor, ate seaweed for breakfast, took the
longest bath of my life, took another one, and absorbed the style
that has enchanted Westerners since the days of Commodore Perry.
I'm tempted to call this self-imposed isolation ``nunlike,'' except
that my principal activity, other than enjoying my surroundings,
was reading ``Memoirs of a Geisha.''
</P>
<P>
   You could easily miss Tawaraya. The rambling complex lies low,
its walls and roofs partly masked by trees. It looks inward, toward
its courtyards, presenting a nearly blank face to the street. The
structure's self-effacing subtlety is part of the Japanese
blending-into-nature principle that has won legions of such
influential fans as Frank Lloyd Wright. It's a style allergic to
ostentation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rules of the ryokan &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On my arrival, a bellman led me through a corridor paved with
wet stones. When not carrying suitcases, his role seemed to be to
keep washing the rocks, assuring not only their cleanliness, but
their shine. Via sign language he told me I was supposed to sit on
a step, change into leather slippers, and give him my espadrilles _
which he then scrubbed. My guidebook had cautioned about knowing
the rules before going to a ryokan, including the no-shoes one. But
I found the Tawaraya staff ever ready to nudge me into the required
behavior, even the required outfit _ without a word of either
English, which for the most part they don't speak, or Japanese,
which they knew I didn't. It was soothing, this silent
communication.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in kimono ushered me into a little reception room and
gave me green tea. The doorway to the adjacent library is so low I
had to fold myself almost in half to fit through, which felt
humbling, in the nicest way. The little library has one window,
whose top half is masked by a blind, so you're forced to focus on
the ground-level view of shrub and sculpture in the courtyard. One
shrub. One sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   My sensibilities were gently shaken in my 24 hours in Tawaraya.
Did I really want to go home to 15 rooms of Victorian clutter, when
a futon, a chair, and a rough pottery vase with a single white
flower were starting to seem quite enough?
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the spaces at Tawaraya is tiny, but they're never
claustrophobic. They maintain their mystery by not lining up in a
European-style enfilade. You have a delicious sense of not knowing
what's ahead. There are only 18 guest rooms, no restaurant, and
virtually no public spaces _ you're not there to socialize, and if
your own company and your companion's isn't enough, this isn't the
place for you. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ancient and modern &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My second-floor room looked out on treetops and roofs of
rippling, silvery ceramic tiles. The room seemed spare until I
started scrutinizing it and discovered there was much to see. The
ceiling was pale wood; lights were shaded in paper; bamboo poles
and a rough wooden timber were incorporated into the pale plastered
walls. The floor was at several levels, with a step-down seating
area where low-backed, floor-level chairs aimed at the courtyard
view. There was a television. While Tawaraya is 300 years old, it's
not a Japanese Old Sturbridge Village, intent on re-creating an
authentic past. But the TV was at ground level, behind sliding
screens; to watch it, you'd have to lie on your stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The fragrant, black-bordered tatami mats that cover the floor
are laid out in a grid, the root of so much 20th-century design.
You're not allowed even to wear slippers on the mats, which is
fine: They feel fabulous underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   The palette that at first seemed monochromatic wasn't. The room
had reds, blues, greens, and oranges, just in careful doses. No
pastels, though, except for the pale pink robe laid out for me to
wear during a shiatsu massage by a woman who said, on arrival,
``This is massage. On side, please. Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloth was an important presence in my minihome. The toilet
paper, telephone, minibar, tissue box, and tea set were all covered
with pieces of cloth in quiet prints; part of life's ceremony is
removing them. In the bathroom door, twin panels of rough linen
flutter; you have to brush by them, feeling their texture, to
enter. (The fabric thing got me thinking about a recent visit to
the Soweto ranch house where Nelson Mandela once lived, where the
toilet wears what amounts to a First Communion dress, a confection
of white lace and ruffles.)
</P>
<P>
   My haven was a perfect example of a multipurpose space. The
elderly kimono-clad woman who seemed to be in charge of my personal
happiness unrolled the futon so I could have the massage, rolled it
back up and moved the low lacquered table center stage to serve my
dinner, unrolled the futon and made it up again so I could go to
sleep, and rolled it up still again for breakfast. She'd obviously
practiced this dance for decades, executing it with minimalist
perfection and not one extra gesture.
</P>
<P>
   She served my meals with the same grace, course by course.
Dinner started with sea urchins and ended with a delectable
grapefruit jelly served in a grapefruit rind. The breakfast I'd
asked for at 8 turned up at 7:45. I'd already learned the
importance of promptness in Japan, and wondered if this meant that
checkout time was really 10:45, not 11.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast included spiced cherries and the tastiest salmon I'd
ever eaten. Dining in complete privacy meant I could practice
chopstick-wielding without embarrassment; suddenly, I became
proficient. My one nonbiodegradable contribution to the Tawaraya
trash bin was the pink plastic fork I'd been shlepping all over
Japan. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Three-part bathroom &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I spent almost as much time in the bathroom as in the bed-sitter
of my little world. My chronically incorrect guidebook had warned
about group bathing in ryokans, which isn't what happens at
Tawaraya. You have your own facilities. The bathroom was in three
parts, the least interesting the one with the sink. The roomlet
with the actual tub was a trip. Lined with cedar, it was obviously
meant for splashing and sloshing freely. Lifting a trio of cedar
planks, I found underneath them a tub that looked bottomless and
was filled to the brim. Once it had cooled to a bearable
temperature, I plunged in, displacing enough water to flood a
desert. (I once stayed in an 18th-century English country house
hotel where the bathroom had a sign in Japanese, asking guests not
to do this; an entire Adam ceiling had dissolved during a bout of
particularly exuberant bathing on the floor above.)
</P>
<P>
   When I got around to exploring the room with the toilet, I was
relieved to find it wasn't a traditional floor-level one. It was
the other kind the Japanese like, the high-tech variety. Far more
advanced than anything I've experienced in Europe or America, it
featured a seat warmer and automatic sprays of various intensities
and temperatures, along with directions in English. I have to
admire a toilet that doesn't just sit there and take it _ and a
ryokan not so stuck in the past it can't happily adapt to the good
things of the present. &QL;

 &HT;    RUSSIA LACKING IN TIME, MONEY TO TACKLE Y2K COMPLIANCE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    For Sun., Sept. 12 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ World War III will not be launched when clocks strike
midnight on Jan. 1. A Chernobyl-style meltdown will not occur at
the country's power plants. Banks and businesses will continue to
operate. Russians will have heating and lights.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Moscow have offered repeated assurances that Y2K,
the millennium computer bug, will not disrupt life in Russia or
cause problems for the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then why are so many people so worried?
</P>
<P>
   Russia's declarations may be conspicuous, but the extent to
which the cash-strapped government has addressed the potential Year
2000 glitch is far from certain. Russian computer experts say
Moscow is talking a good game, but in deep denial about the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Time and money are running out, they warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The period from noon on Dec. 31st and for the next 24 hours, I
prefer to lay very still in my bed and do nothing,'' said Jahn
Han-Magamedov, technical director of the Russian Regional Center
for Internet Technologies, a computer-industry think tank in
Moscow. ``When is Russia going to start paying attention to this
problem? Until it costs lives and money?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the British embassy in Moscow issued an
internal memo to its staff suggesting that their families and
relatives not visit Russia between late December and early January
because of fears of potential computer-bug difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   A memo produced by the defense attache's office in the U.S.
embassy in Moscow _ and leaked last week to the press _ said
Russia's military was neglecting safeguards in 100 systems
designated ``mission critical'' of the 1,000 systems in use by the
Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been anxious to cooperate with Moscow on
Y2K _ particularly in safeguarding nuclear warheads and each
country's early-warning defense system _ to protect against a New
Year's Eve glitch that could mistakenly signal a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are back on track after a five-month suspension when
Russia froze relations in protest of the U.S.-led NATO bombing
campaign against Serb-led Yugoslavia, a traditional Russian ally.
U.S.-Russian negotiations resumed in August, two months after the
Kosovo war ended.
</P>
<P>
   United States and Russian officials are confident that
catastrophe will be avoided, if for no other reason than both are
acutely aware of the need to pick up a telephone and talk to the
other should early-warning computers detect something unusual.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of other pitfalls for Russia's aging
computers, which like computers worldwide may or may not go on the
blink by misreading the year 2000 as the double-zero date of 1900:
power plants and heating systems, air and train travel, oil and gas
pipelines, banking and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   As one U.S. official in Russia put it, get ready for
``breakdowns rather than blow-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   While many businesses that have sprouted in the post-Soviet
economy are on-line and automated, few government services are
computerized.
</P>
<P>
   Functions such as welfare rolls and Russia's military draft are
still carried out on paper and by hand. In Moscow, even many of the
traffic signals are still controlled by cops stationed at the
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Even Russia's chief communications regulator has suggested that
the country may have to curtail the number of commercial air
flights and temporarily shut down some hazardous industries ``just
in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials insist that their Soviet-era missile complex
simply is not designed to rely on computers that measure time in
such a way as to be affected by the millennium bug. Likewise, they
say, their nine major nuclear power plants are protected, though
some private experts are not so sure about the utility grids that
supply electricity to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other major
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Various warnings have come in reports from the CIA, the European
Union and private analysts who predict the first few months of 2000
could be rough for Russia _ with abrupt power-plant shutdowns,
transportation delays and possible interruptions in the flow from
Russia's natural gas pipelines. Europe depends on roughly one-third
of its natural gas from Russia to run heating and electrical
plants.
</P>
<P>
   If telephones go out or the power is interrupted, most Russians
all-too accustomed to things not working may consider it is just
another day in their faulty post-Soviet society.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been plagued by economic and political instability
since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. So it is not
surprising that a difficult-to-understand computer glitch _ whose
effects are even more difficult to predict _ would not cause much
public concern.
</P>
<P>
   But computer experts warn that more must be done to tackle the
problem and they accuse government officials of purposely
downplaying the potential risks. In July, the country's finance
ministry estimated that Russia's government agencies need at least
$187 million to solve its Y2K problems _ inexplicably down from
previous government estimates of a need for as much as $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the government estimated that its agencies have about
28,000 vital computer systems, only a third of which are ready for
the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But officials insist that the government in just the past few
months has made strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well-known that Russia was very late in addressing this.
The attitude is if we can not solve the problem, let's do what we
can to minimize the risks. That is being accomplished,'' Natalya
Cherneh, a government consultant who organized a July conference on
the Y2K problem for Russian lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia does have one thing going for it _ it's lagging progress
compared to the rest of the industrialized world. The country of
146 million people has relatively few computers. Personal computers
were strictly limited during Soviet times and the large, centrally
planned industries were slow to convert to automation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the flip-side of Russia's backwardness in the world.
We can probably expect fewer problems because we have fewer
computers controlling things,'' said Dmitri Kuvalin of the Russian
Academy of Science's Institute of Economic Forecasting, which has
studied the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict the big problems may hit small and medium-sized
companies who have joined the computer age on the cheap _ buying
knock-off personal computers and pirated software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not likely to affect that average Russian,'' said
Kuvalin, ``simply because the lives of most people here still are
not dependant on the computer.''

   EAST TIMOR
</P>
<P>
   Appears certain to top a crowded security agenda at APEC.
Hundreds have been killed and more than 200,000 left homeless by
bloodshed since Timor's 900,000 residents voted overwhelmingly for
independence from Indonesia in a U.N.-sponsored referendum August
30. Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975, in a
takeover never endorsed by the United Nations. An estimated 200,000
people have been killed there since then, as part of Jakarta's
iron-fisted attempts to thwart secessionist movements. With more
than 200 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth most
populous nation. Elements within its government and military fear
that independence for East Timor could lead to an unraveling of the
country, a collection of hundreds of islands and disparate groups
speaking more than 100 distinct languages.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TAIWAN
</P>
<P>
   Relations have been tense ever since Mao Zedong's Communists won
a civil war over Nationalists and founded the People's Republic of
China in 1949. The Nationalists retreated to Taiwan, at that time a
province of China, and set up their own government in Taipei.
Beijing still claims Taiwan as part of China. Though it prefers a
peaceful evolution toward reunification, Beijing also asserts the
right to use force, if necessary, to bring the island under its
control. Taipei conducts itself, however, as if it were a sovereign
state. The on-again, off-again nature of relations between the two
entities got prickly in July, after Taiwan's President Lee Tung Hui
characterized Beijing-Taipei ties as ``special state-to-state
relations.'' That smacked of a declaration of independence and set
off alarm bells in Beijing, which promptly denounced the remarks as
``a dangerous step.'' Beijing began flying increasingly aggressive
fighter-jet missions testing Taiwan's air space. That resulted in
several near-dogfights and sowed fears that a miscalculation by one
side or another could spark a war. Tempers have moderated but
analysts remain watchful, particularly in the lead-up to Beijing's
plans for a festive 50th anniversary celebration Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH KOREA
</P>
<P>
   Divided North and South during the dawn of the Cold War, the
Korean Peninsula remains one of the most tense pieces of real
estate on Earth. Some one million combat-ready troops _ North
Koreans faced off against South Koreans and Americans _ are arrayed
within 60 miles of the craggy border dividing the two countries,
the badly failing communist North and the prospering, Democratic
capitalist South. The two countries remain technically at war 46
years after a cease-fire halted fighting in a three-year conflict
that killed nearly two million people _ 37,000 of them Americans.
The United States suspects the North of building at least one
nuclear weapon. U.S. diplomats have worked in recent weeks to try
to defuse tensions after the North _ which a year ago fired a
three-stage test rocket over Japanese air space _ threatened to
test a missile capable of reaching the western United States. On
the eve of last week's U.S.-North Korean talks in Berlin, Pyongyang
loosed another zinger: unilaterally declaring that its territorial
waters extended some 35 miles southward, into South Korea's own
seas, and threatening to fire on any South Korean vessel that
violates the North's dictate. The issue sparked a Naval battle in
June, when North Korean warships repeatedly tested South Korean
waters. The two navies finally exchanged gunfire in a skirmish that
ended with the sinking of a North Korean torpedo boat and the
reported loss of about 30 North Korean sailors.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-PAKISTAN
</P>
<P>
   Centuries of Muslim-Hindu rivalry came to a boil in 1947, when
India won its independence from Britain. The former colony was
partitioned into India, predominantly Hindu, and Pakistan,
predominantly Muslim. The province of Kashmir, along the southern
rim of the Himalayas, got caught in the middle. Though the region
is predominantly Muslim, Kashmir's Hindu Maharaja, or prince, chose
in 1947 to place Kashmir under Indian control. Pakistan contends
that the Kashmiri people have a right to vote on whether to be part
of Pakistan, India or fully independent. Such a referendum has been
endorsed by past governments of India as well as the United
Nations. The two countries have fought wars over Kashmir, in 1947
and again in 1965. Indian control over the region has been fraught
with accusations of decades of human rights abuses. Last spring the
issue erupted again. Pakistan, claiming provocations, attacked
India, sparking a counterattack, in fighting that left more than
1,000 dead on both sides. Frequent shelling by both sides
continues. The nightmare scenario for strategists is all-out war
between the two countries, both of which tested nuclear weapons, in
defiance of U.S. appeals, in May 1998.

 &HT;    DIPLOMATIC MELODRAMA OVER CHINESE ENTRY IN THE WTO MAY BE
NEARING END
 &HT;    With CLINTON-APEC-$ADV12.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (k) Commentary categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ One of the world's longest-running diplomatic
melodramas, China's pursuit of membership in the World Trade
Organization, may be approaching its final act this weekend at a
summit in New Zealand between Presidents Bill Clinton and Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   American agribusiness firms, telecommunications companies and
banks are watching with rapt attention. They hope to reap bigger
bucks in China's 1.2 billion-consumer domestic market if the talks
Sunday result in a Clinton-Jiang agreement to let China join the
global trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's admittance to the WTO is critical in order for that
market to be opened up and be accessible to the most efficient
suppliers,'' Rob McRae, vice president of Cargill International
Trading Ltd. in Singapore, told a conference on wheat and oilseeds
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   China's expected gains from entering the WTO are more subtle.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, China wants to benefit from the increased
exports that should accompany freer world trade and a globalized
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But for the next 5 to 10 years, Chinese businessmen also want to
retain many of the tariffs and the barriers that fence off such
sectors as domestic oil refining, telecommunications and
agriculture from investment by foreign capitalists. That's why
China insisted this month that it must be admitted to the WTO as a
``developing'' nation, just as it did when it first sought
admission 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese market would not open up in a day and China would
not move with alarming speed to an entirely free market,'' the
chief Chinese negotiator, Vice Trade Minister Long Yongtu, has
assured Chinese businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   The expected Clinton-Jiang talks on China's WTO status could of
course, go nowhere or even fail to materialize. The United States,
after all, is just as concerned with China's current tensions with
Taiwan, restoring relations disrupted by the May 7 embassy bombing
and Beijing's suspension of human rights, military and security
contacts with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But since China began experimenting with an ``open door'' trade
policy in the mid-1980s, almost every major trading country _
including the United States _ has wanted to include China in the
WTO, the body that is the world's traffic cop and rule-setter on
exports and imports.
</P>
<P>
   But China's application needs the approval of all 134 member
nations and regions that make up the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising, something has
always popped up at the last minute to block China's admission.
This spring, the accidental American bombing of the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia caused China to
break off expert-level talks with the United States on the issue
for five months.
</P>
<P>
   While American businesses are cheerleading for China's
admission, Clinton must face the political realities of an
anti-China bias in the run-up to the next presidential election.
The Democrats risk continued bashing by Republicans _ on
allegations of Chinese government spying and illegal political
contributions _ if China gains entry to the WTO on what look like
too-favorable terms.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Jiang cannot come home with an agreement that
looks like a cave-in to America. Especially now, on the eve of the
50th anniversary of the communist revolution on Oct. 1, he cannot
afford the appearance that Chinese pride and power have been
punctured.
</P>
<P>
   That's why his foreign affairs spokesman Zhu Bangzao said this
month, ``China will never sacrifice national interests for WTO
membership.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton meets with his counterparts
from 20 other Asia-Pacific powers on Sunday in New Zealand, the
leaders will doubtless try to cast their gaze to the future.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, they must deal with some troubling history.
</P>
<P>
   In three parts of Asia the enduring legacy of five decades of
simmering conflict _ between China and Taiwan; Pakistan and India;
and North and South Korea _ continue to pose the threat of war.
</P>
<P>
   In a fourth _ Indonesia's East Timor _ a quarter-century of
strife has erupted in a week of bloodshed and destruction that has
left hundreds dead and forced up to 200,000 others to flee their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders will use the summit _ the annual meeting of the leaders
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC _ to
spotlight the patchy turnabout in the economies of nations that
together will do more than $1 trillion in two-way trade with the
United States this year, roughly 40 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
   This year's agenda, however, has been hijacked by security
concerns roiling a region where the United States has fought three
wars in this century alone and still maintains nearly 100,000
military forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lasting economic recovery in Asia depends on more than open
markets. It will also require continued stability in the region,
which can never be taken for granted,'' said Clinton's National
Security Adviser, Samuel Berger. ``This is where the United States
plays an especially vital role, and it ill be an important part of
our agenda at APEC.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in East Timor appears certain to dominate the two-day
leaders' summit, Sunday and Monday in Auckland, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Like other regional conflicts, the troubles in East Timor stem
from unfinished business with deep roots in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The island of Timor, in the eastern half of the 3,000-mile-long
archipelago that makes up Indonesia, was once divided between Dutch
and Portuguese colonists. The Netherlands ceded West Timor, the
Dutch-controlled portion, to Indonesia in 1950. Twenty-five years
later, Indonesia invaded East Timor, evicting the Portuguese in an
annexation never recognized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's military has ruled East Timor with an iron fist,
drawing two decades of criticism from the United States and
standing as a formidable obstacle to U.S.-Indonesian relations.
</P>
<P>
   On August 30, under U.N. auspices, East Timor's 900,000
residents voted overwhelmingly (78.5 percent) in favor of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   When U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced the results
last weekend, militia groups, police and thugs loyal to the
government in Jakarta took to the streets armed with assault
rifles, machetes and clubs on a murderous rampage targeting anyone
suspected of backing independence.
</P>
<P>
   In violation of its commitment to maintain order, Indonesia's
military has largely stood by and watched as hundreds have been
killed and hundreds more wounded in an orgy of horror, bloodshed
and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, right now the Indonesian military has not done what
it said it would do and has
</P>
<P>
   failed in certain cases, if not participated in some of the
violence,'' State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said Wednesday.
``Indonesia's relations with the international community, including
the United States, are at risk here.''
</P>
<P>
   With the government of Indonesian President B.J. Habibie unable,
or unwilling, to halt the terror, APEC's members are split over
whether to send in a U.N. peacekeeping force to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Without Jakarta's approval _ so far, denied _ it would take a
U.N. Security Council resolution, a measure no one was anticipating
as of last week, to deploy such a force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very tough choice in front of the international
community, and it's not just a question of sending in the Blue
Helmets,'' as U.N. peacekeepers are called, said Indonesian scholar
James Clad, who teaches Southeast Asian studies at Georgetown
University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to see how they would be able to win the
agreement of all the elements of the Indonesian government, get in
there and not be seen as taking sides,'' Clad said in a telephone
interview from Indonesia, where he's been monitoring developments.
``It is very grim.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was still shaping its views on the
issue as the president boarded Air Force One late Thursday for the
long trans-Pacific flight.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the U.S.-led NATO air campaign over the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, the administration appeared prepared to see
another country _ Australia has volunteered _ take the lead in any
U.N. operation in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   With huge economic and strategic stakes across Asia, however,
the United States is expected to play some role in trying to arrest
the anarchy in East Timor, much as it has a hand in efforts to
manage other hotspots across one of the world's most volatile
regions.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear what, if anything, Clinton and his APEC partners
might do to allay regional security concerns, apart from
demonstrating that they are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   That's preferable, though, to simply ignoring festering
situations and allowing risks to escalate unattended, said
international affairs analyst Stephen Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   A senior fellow in the foreign studies program at the
Washington-based Brookings Institution, Cohen faults the
international community for not building a framework for
Mideast-style peace talks aimed at finding a resolution to the
Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   It will take, at best, years to find a solution, said Cohen, but
the international community could help nudge a peace process
forward with a combination of incentives and sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 10 solutions,'' said Cohen. ``But a solution
that everybody can agree on is impossible to find at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties themselves, moreover, are at odds over how to
proceed. Dwarfed by its giant neighbor, Pakistan is combing the
Muslim world _ including Indonesia, the home to the largest Islamic
population on Earth _ for diplomatic support on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   India, for its part, wants no outside mediators fouling the
current balance of power. That equation is tilted heavily in favor
of India, home to the world's third-largest army, with 1.1 million
men in arms, and the fourth largest air force, with 600 warplanes
and nearly as many transport craft and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Neither India nor Pakistan is an APEC member, but Cohen said
it's likely the forum will issue some sort of statement calling on
the two countries to rely on dialogue to try to resolve the dispute
over time.
</P>
<P>
   A statement is also expected _ perhaps issued jointly by
Clinton, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung and Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi following their trilateral meeting schedule
for Sunday _ appealing to North Korea for restraint and cooperation
in exchange for increased diplomatic contacts and assistance from
the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has taken a series of steps the South has regarded
as provocative over the past year. Pyongyang fired a multi-stage
missile over Japan a year ago; engaged in a naval shoot-out with
South Korean ships in June; has threatened to test a new long-range
rocket that could reach the western United States; and has
announced that it would no longer honor the dividing line between
its territorial waters and those of the South .
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, North Korea is escalating its contacts
with the United States and South Korea, as evidenced by meetings
with U.S. diplomats in Berlin earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem as if the North is continuing to be interested in
some kind of improvement (in relations) with the South,'' said
Korean analyst Stephen Costello, president of ProGlobal Inc., a
Washington consulting firm. ``The South, Japan and the United
States want to take this momentum and see what they can do with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to use a Saturday meeting with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to try to build momentum in Sino-American
relations, sorely tested this year by trade quarrels and war in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing opposed NATO's Balkans campaign even before U.S. bombs
destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last spring. That
debacle, blamed by an apologetic Pentagon on faulty intelligence,
plumbed the lowest mark in U.S.-China relations since the Tiananmen
Square massacre a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ties were further frayed in July, when Taiwan's president, Lee
Teng Hui, insisted during an press interview that Taiwan be
accorded ``special state to state relations,'' with China.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing bristled at the suggestion that Taiwan _ which China
regards as an outlaw province _ should be accorded equal standing
with China during talks over Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that the 1.2 billion Chinese people cannot
accept,'' Jiang told reporters this month during a trip to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The casual observer might wonder why all the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   To China, though, Lee's words represented not simply an
unacceptable escalation in independence rhetoric, but a marked
shift in attitude in Taipei. With Taiwan slated to hold
presidential elections next March _ only the second such vote in
the 5,000-year history of the Chinese people, Beijing is looking to
nip any change in tone in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has changed is that Taiwan has finally gone out of its
way to make the point that it is a sovereign, independent state and
is going out of its way to publicize that fact,'' said former U.S.
diplomat John Tkacik Jr., president of China Business Intelligence,
an Arlington, Va.-based consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' he said, ``it has played it down out of fear of
offending Beijing.''

CALIFORNIA GOV. AGAINST SOME MEDIA INTERVIEWS WITH PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Gov. Gray Davis doesn't want reporters to have
face-to-face interviews with state prison inmates, saying ``the
purpose of incarceration is punishment ... not to provide
additional celebrity to convicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis vetoed a bill late Tuesday that would have lifted a
three-year ban at the Department of Corrections on arranging
interviews with reporters. Former Gov. Pete Wilson installed the
regulations, angering free-speech groups who said he was trying to
squelch reports about prison conditions and alleged abuse by
guards.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, by Assemblywoman Carole Migden, a Democrat from San
Francisco, would have required prison officials to schedule
interviews for reporters unless the interview threatened prison
security. It also would have allowed reporters to bring writing
materials, tape recorders and video cameras with them to the
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis said the bill allowed journalists ``virtually
unlimited access'' to convicted felons. He said reporters should
get no more access than family members, who can talk to prisoners
during visiting hours, accept a collect phone call, write letters,
or talk with the prisoner's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is inconsistent with the national trend to reduce,
not expand, rights of prisoners,'' Davis said in his veto message,
adding that prison officials has said that the measure would cause
disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' spokesman, Michael Bustamante, said the governor also was
concerned the bill ``didn't allow for balanced reporting,'' and
then joked that Davis would prefer to review reporter's stories
before they are printed.
</P>
<P>
   California taxpayers spend $4.2 billion a year to house and feed
about 158,000 inmates in 33 prisons, making it one of the largest
prison systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Migden said lifting the ban would allow reporters to see if the
state's inmate rehabilitation efforts and prisons in particular are
working. She said it would not have opened up murderers to
celebrity status, as Davis contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Charles Manson-like, glamorized killer could absolutely be
prohibited visits,'' Migden said. ``You have 150,000 other non-name
regular inmates serving time, and the measure was really designed
for them to have a voice, to have access, to have the opportunity
to speak about their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Migden noted that the California Correctional Peace Officers
Association, the main prison guard union, supported the bill. The
union was a strong supporter of Davis during the campaign, but the
Democratic governor has conspicuously avoided appearing liberal on
any bills relating to crime and punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the field were not opposed to the visits,''
Migden said. ``We have 33 correctional institutions. They receive
an average of 10 requests a year. So it wasn't that there was a
surfeit of requests or that prison authorities thought they would
be overwhelmed. It's occasional. It's a rare occasion that there is
a visitor.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton meets with his counterparts
from 20 other Asia-Pacific powers on Sunday in New Zealand, the
leaders will doubtless try to cast their gaze to the future.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, they must deal with some troubling history.
</P>
<P>
   In three parts of Asia the enduring legacy of five decades of
simmering conflict _ between China and Taiwan; Pakistan and India;
and North and South Korea _ continue to pose the threat of war.
</P>
<P>
   In a fourth _ Indonesia's East Timor _ a quarter-century of
strife has erupted in a week of bloodshed and destruction that has
left hundreds dead and forced up to 200,000 others to flee their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders will use the summit _ the annual meeting of the leaders
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC _ to
spotlight the patchy turnabout in the economies of nations that
together will do more than $1 trillion in two-way trade with the
United States this year, roughly 40 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
   This year's agenda, however, has been hijacked by security
concerns roiling a region where the United States has fought three
wars in this century alone and still maintains nearly 100,000
military forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lasting economic recovery in Asia depends on more than open
markets. It will also require continued stability in the region,
which can never be taken for granted,'' said Clinton's National
Security Adviser, Samuel Berger. ``This is where the United States
plays an especially vital role, and it will be an important part of
our agenda at APEC.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in East Timor appears certain to dominate the two-day
leaders' summit, Sunday and Monday in Auckland, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Like other regional conflicts, the troubles in East Timor stem
from unfinished business with deep roots in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The island of Timor, in the eastern half of the 3,000-mile-long
archipelago that makes up Indonesia, was once divided between Dutch
and Portuguese colonists. The Netherlands ceded West Timor, the
Dutch-controlled portion, to Indonesia in 1950. Twenty-five years
later, Indonesia invaded East Timor, evicting the Portuguese in an
annexation never recognized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's military has ruled East Timor with an iron fist,
drawing two decades of criticism from the United States and
standing as a formidable obstacle to U.S.-Indonesian relations.
</P>
<P>
   On August 30, under U.N. auspices, East Timor's 900,000
residents voted overwhelmingly (78.5 percent) in favor of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   When U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced the results
last weekend, militia groups, police and thugs loyal to the
government in Jakarta took to the streets armed with assault
rifles, machetes and clubs on a murderous rampage targeting anyone
suspected of backing independence.
</P>
<P>
   In violation of its commitment to maintain order, Indonesia's
military has largely stood by and watched as hundreds have been
killed and hundreds more wounded in an orgy of horror, bloodshed
and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, right now the Indonesian military has not done what
it said it would do and has
</P>
<P>
   failed in certain cases, if not participated in some of the
violence,'' State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said Wednesday.
``Indonesia's relations with the international community, including
the United States, are at risk here.''
</P>
<P>
   With the government of Indonesian President B.J. Habibie unable,
or unwilling, to halt the terror, APEC's members are split over
whether to send in a U.N. peacekeeping force to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Without Jakarta's approval _ so far, denied _ it would take a
U.N. Security Council resolution, a measure no one was anticipating
as of last week, to deploy such a force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very tough choice in front of the international
community, and it's not just a question of sending in the Blue
Helmets,'' as U.N. peacekeepers are called, said Indonesian scholar
James Clad, who teaches Southeast Asian studies at Georgetown
University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to see how they would be able to win the
agreement of all the elements of the Indonesian government, get in
there and not be seen as taking sides,'' Clad said in a telephone
interview from Indonesia, where he's been monitoring developments.
``It is very grim.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was still shaping its views on the
issue as the president boarded Air Force One late Thursday for the
long trans-Pacific flight.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the U.S.-led NATO air campaign over the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, the administration appeared prepared to see
another country _ Australia has volunteered _ take the lead in any
U.N. operation in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   With huge economic and strategic stakes across Asia, however,
the United States is expected to play some role in trying to arrest
the anarchy in East Timor, much as it has a hand in efforts to
manage other hotspots across one of the world's most volatile
regions.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear what, if anything, Clinton and his APEC partners
might do to allay regional security concerns, apart from
demonstrating that they are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   That's preferable, though, to simply ignoring festering
situations and allowing risks to escalate unattended, said
international affairs analyst Stephen Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   A senior fellow in the foreign studies program at the
Washington-based Brookings Institution, Cohen faults the
international community for not building a framework for
Mideast-style peace talks aimed at finding a resolution to the
Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   It will take, at best, years to find a solution, said Cohen, but
the international community could help nudge a peace process
forward with a combination of incentives and sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 10 solutions,'' said Cohen. ``But a solution
that everybody can agree on is impossible to find at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties themselves, moreover, are at odds over how to
proceed. Dwarfed by its giant neighbor, Pakistan is combing the
Muslim world _ including Indonesia, the home to the largest Islamic
population on Earth _ for diplomatic support on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   India, for its part, wants no outside mediators fouling the
current balance of power. That equation is tilted heavily in favor
of India, home to the world's third-largest army, with 1.1 million
men in arms, and the fourth largest air force, with 600 warplanes
and nearly as many transport craft and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Neither India nor Pakistan is an APEC member, but Cohen said
it's likely the forum will issue some sort of statement calling on
the two countries to rely on dialogue to try to resolve the dispute
over time.
</P>
<P>
   A statement is also expected _ perhaps issued jointly by
Clinton, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung and Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi following their trilateral meeting schedule
for Sunday _ appealing to North Korea for restraint and cooperation
in exchange for increased diplomatic contacts and assistance from
the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has taken a series of steps the South has regarded
as provocative over the past year. Pyongyang fired a multi-stage
missile over Japan a year ago; engaged in a naval shoot-out with
South Korean ships in June; has threatened to test a new long-range
rocket that could reach the western United States; and has
announced that it would no longer honor the dividing line between
its territorial waters and those of the South .
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, North Korea is escalating its contacts
with the United States and South Korea, as evidenced by meetings
with U.S. diplomats in Berlin earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem as if the North is continuing to be interested in
some kind of improvement (in relations) with the South,'' said
Korean analyst Stephen Costello, president of ProGlobal Inc., a
Washington consulting firm. ``The South, Japan and the United
States want to take this momentum and see what they can do with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to use a Saturday meeting with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to try to build momentum in Sino-American
relations, sorely tested this year by trade quarrels and war in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing opposed NATO's Balkans campaign even before U.S. bombs
destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last spring. That
debacle, blamed by an apologetic Pentagon on faulty intelligence,
plumbed the lowest mark in U.S.-China relations since the Tiananmen
Square massacre a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ties were further frayed in July, when Taiwan's president, Lee
Teng Hui, insisted during an press interview that Taiwan be
accorded ``special state to state relations,'' with China.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing bristled at the suggestion that Taiwan _ which China
regards as an outlaw province _ should be accorded equal standing
with China during talks over Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that the 1.2 billion Chinese people cannot
accept,'' Jiang told reporters this month during a trip to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The casual observer might wonder why all the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   To China, though, Lee's words represented not simply an
unacceptable escalation in independence rhetoric, but a marked
shift in attitude in Taipei. With Taiwan slated to hold
presidential elections next March _ only the second such vote in
the 5,000-year history of the Chinese people, Beijing is looking to
nip any change in tone in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has changed is that Taiwan has finally gone out of its
way to make the point that it is a sovereign, independent state and
is going out of its way to publicize that fact,'' said former U.S.
diplomat John Tkacik Jr., president of China Business Intelligence,
an Arlington, Va.-based consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' he said, ``it has played it down out of fear of
offending Beijing.''

 &HT;    RUSSIA LACKING IN TIME, MONEY TO TACKLE Y2K COMPLIANCE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ World War III will not be launched when clocks strike
midnight on Jan. 1. A Chernobyl-style meltdown will not occur at
the country's power plants. Banks and businesses will continue to
operate. Russians will have heating and lights.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Moscow have offered repeated assurances that Y2K,
the millennium computer bug, will not disrupt life in Russia or
cause problems for the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then why are so many people so worried?
</P>
<P>
   Russia's declarations may be conspicuous, but the extent to
which the cash-strapped government has addressed the potential Year
2000 glitch is far from certain. Russian computer experts say
Moscow is talking a good game, but in deep denial about the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Time and money are running out, they warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The period from noon on Dec. 31st and for the next 24 hours, I
prefer to lay very still in my bed and do nothing,'' said Jahn
Han-Magamedov, technical director of the Russian Regional Center
for Internet Technologies, a computer-industry think tank in
Moscow. ``When is Russia going to start paying attention to this
problem? Until it costs lives and money?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the British embassy in Moscow issued an
internal memo to its staff suggesting that their families and
relatives not visit Russia between late December and early January
because of fears of potential computer-bug difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   A memo produced by the defense attache's office in the U.S.
embassy in Moscow _ and leaked last week to the press _ said
Russia's military was neglecting safeguards in 100 systems
designated ``mission critical'' of the 1,000 systems in use by the
Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been anxious to cooperate with Moscow on
Y2K _ particularly in safeguarding nuclear warheads and each
country's early-warning defense system _ to protect against a New
Year's Eve glitch that could mistakenly signal a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are back on track after a five-month suspension when
Russia froze relations in protest of the U.S.-led NATO bombing
campaign against Serb-led Yugoslavia, a traditional Russian ally.
U.S.-Russian negotiations resumed in August, two months after the
Kosovo war ended.
</P>
<P>
   United States and Russian officials are confident that
catastrophe will be avoided, if for no other reason than both are
acutely aware of the need to pick up a telephone and talk to the
other should early-warning computers detect something unusual.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of other pitfalls for Russia's aging
computers, which like computers worldwide may or may not go on the
blink by misreading the year 2000 as the double-zero date of 1900:
power plants and heating systems, air and train travel, oil and gas
pipelines, banking and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   As one U.S. official in Russia put it, get ready for
``breakdowns rather than blow-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   While many businesses that have sprouted in the post-Soviet
economy are on-line and automated, few government services are
computerized.
</P>
<P>
   Functions such as welfare rolls and Russia's military draft are
still carried out on paper and by hand. In Moscow, even many of the
traffic signals are still controlled by cops stationed at the
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Even Russia's chief communications regulator has suggested that
the country may have to curtail the number of commercial air
flights and temporarily shut down some hazardous industries ``just
in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials insist that their Soviet-era missile complex
simply is not designed to rely on computers that measure time in
such a way as to be affected by the millennium bug. Likewise, they
say, their nine major nuclear power plants are protected, though
some private experts are not so sure about the utility grids that
supply electricity to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other major
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Various warnings have come in reports from the CIA, the European
Union and private analysts who predict the first few months of 2000
could be rough for Russia _ with abrupt power-plant shutdowns,
transportation delays and possible interruptions in the flow from
Russia's natural gas pipelines. Europe depends on roughly one-third
of its natural gas from Russia to run heating and electrical
plants.
</P>
<P>
   If telephones go out or the power is interrupted, most Russians
all-too accustomed to things not working may consider it is just
another day in their faulty post-Soviet society.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been plagued by economic and political instability
since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. So it is not
surprising that a difficult-to-understand computer glitch _ whose
effects are even more difficult to predict _ would not cause much
public concern.
</P>
<P>
   But computer experts warn that more must be done to tackle the
problem and they accuse government officials of purposely
downplaying the potential risks. In July, the country's finance
ministry estimated that Russia's government agencies need at least
$187 million to solve its Y2K problems _ inexplicably down from
previous government estimates of a need for as much as $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the government estimated that its agencies have about
28,000 vital computer systems, only a third of which are ready for
the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But officials insist that the government in just the past few
months has made strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well-known that Russia was very late in addressing this.
The attitude is if we can not solve the problem, let's do what we
can to minimize the risks. That is being accomplished,'' Natalya
Cherneh, a government consultant who organized a July conference on
the Y2K problem for Russian lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia does have one thing going for it _ it's lagging progress
compared to the rest of the industrialized world. The country of
146 million people has relatively few computers. Personal computers
were strictly limited during Soviet times and the large, centrally
planned industries were slow to convert to automation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the flip-side of Russia's backwardness in the world.
We can probably expect fewer problems because we have fewer
computers controlling things,'' said Dmitri Kuvalin of the Russian
Academy of Science's Institute of Economic Forecasting, which has
studied the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict the big problems may hit small and medium-sized
companies who have joined the computer age on the cheap _ buying
knock-off personal computers and pirated software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not likely to affect that average Russian,'' said
Kuvalin, ``simply because the lives of most people here still are
not dependant on the computer.''

   EAST TIMOR
</P>
<P>
   Appears certain to top a crowded security agenda at APEC.
Hundreds have been killed and more than 200,000 left homeless by
bloodshed since Timor's 900,000 residents voted overwhelmingly for
independence from Indonesia in a U.N.-sponsored referendum August
30. Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975, in a
takeover never endorsed by the United Nations. An estimated 200,000
people have been killed there since then, as part of Jakarta's
iron-fisted attempts to thwart secessionist movements. With more
than 200 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth most
populous nation. Elements within its government and military fear
that independence for East Timor could lead to an unraveling of the
country, a collection of hundreds of islands and disparate groups
speaking more than 100 distinct languages.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TAIWAN
</P>
<P>
   Relations have been tense ever since Mao Zedong's Communists won
a civil war over Nationalists and founded the People's Republic of
China in 1949. The Nationalists retreated to Taiwan, at that time a
province of China, and set up their own government in Taipei.
Beijing still claims Taiwan as part of China. Though it prefers a
peaceful evolution toward reunification, Beijing also asserts the
right to use force, if necessary, to bring the island under its
control. Taipei conducts itself, however, as if it were a sovereign
state. The on-again, off-again nature of relations between the two
entities got prickly in July, after Taiwan's President Lee Tung Hui
characterized Beijing-Taipei ties as ``special state-to-state
relations.'' That smacked of a declaration of independence and set
off alarm bells in Beijing, which promptly denounced the remarks as
``a dangerous step.'' Beijing began flying increasingly aggressive
fighter-jet missions testing Taiwan's air space. That resulted in
several near-dogfights and sowed fears that a miscalculation by one
side or another could spark a war. Tempers have moderated but
analysts remain watchful, particularly in the lead-up to Beijing's
plans for a festive 50th anniversary celebration Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH KOREA
</P>
<P>
   Divided North and South during the dawn of the Cold War, the
Korean Peninsula remains one of the most tense pieces of real
estate on Earth. Some one million combat-ready troops _ North
Koreans faced off against South Koreans and Americans _ are arrayed
within 60 miles of the craggy border dividing the two countries,
the badly failing communist North and the prospering, Democratic
capitalist South. The two countries remain technically at war 46
years after a cease-fire halted fighting in a three-year conflict
that killed nearly two million people _ 37,000 of them Americans.
The United States suspects the North of building at least one
nuclear weapon. U.S. diplomats have worked in recent weeks to try
to defuse tensions after the North _ which a year ago fired a
three-stage test rocket over Japanese air space _ threatened to
test a missile capable of reaching the western United States. On
the eve of last week's U.S.-North Korean talks in Berlin, Pyongyang
loosed another zinger: unilaterally declaring that its territorial
waters extended some 35 miles southward, into South Korea's own
seas, and threatening to fire on any South Korean vessel that
violates the North's dictate. The issue sparked a Naval battle in
June, when North Korean warships repeatedly tested South Korean
waters. The two navies finally exchanged gunfire in a skirmish that
ended with the sinking of a North Korean torpedo boat and the
reported loss of about 30 North Korean sailors.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-PAKISTAN
</P>
<P>
   Centuries of Muslim-Hindu rivalry came to a boil in 1947, when
India won its independence from Britain. The former colony was
partitioned into India, predominantly Hindu, and Pakistan,
predominantly Muslim. The province of Kashmir, along the southern
rim of the Himalayas, got caught in the middle. Though the region
is predominantly Muslim, Kashmir's Hindu Maharaja, or prince, chose
in 1947 to place Kashmir under Indian control. Pakistan contends
that the Kashmiri people have a right to vote on whether to be part
of Pakistan, India or fully independent. Such a referendum has been
endorsed by past governments of India as well as the United
Nations. The two countries have fought wars over Kashmir, in 1947
and again in 1965. Indian control over the region has been fraught
with accusations of decades of human rights abuses. Last spring the
issue erupted again. Pakistan, claiming provocations, attacked
India, sparking a counterattack, in fighting that left more than
1,000 dead on both sides. Frequent shelling by both sides
continues. The nightmare scenario for strategists is all-out war
between the two countries, both of which tested nuclear weapons, in
defiance of U.S. appeals, in May 1998.

   BEIJING _ One of the world's longest-running diplomatic
melodramas, China's pursuit of membership in the World Trade
Organization, may be approaching its final act this weekend at a
summit in New Zealand between Presidents Bill Clinton and Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   American agribusiness firms, telecommunications companies and
banks are watching with rapt attention. They hope to reap bigger
bucks in China's 1.2 billion-consumer domestic market if the talks
Sunday result in a Clinton-Jiang agreement to let China join the
global trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's admittance to the WTO is critical in order for that
market to be opened up and be accessible to the most efficient
suppliers,'' Rob McRae, vice president of Cargill International
Trading Ltd. in Singapore, told a conference on wheat and oilseeds

<P>
   China's expected gains from entering the WTO are more subtle.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, China wants to benefit from the increased
exports that should accompany freer world trade and a globalized
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But for the next 5 to 10 years, Chinese businessmen also want to
retain many of the tariffs and the barriers that fence off such
sectors as domestic oil refining, telecommunications and
agriculture from investment by foreign capitalists. That's why
China insisted this month that it must be admitted to the WTO as a
``developing'' nation, just as it did when it first sought
admission 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese market would not open up in a day and China would
not move with alarming speed to an entirely free market,'' the
chief Chinese negotiator, Vice Trade Minister Long Yongtu, has
assured Chinese businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   The expected Clinton-Jiang talks on China's WTO status could of
course, go nowhere or even fail to materialize. The United States,
after all, is just as concerned with China's current tensions with
Taiwan, restoring relations disrupted by the May 7 embassy bombing
and Beijing's suspension of human rights, military and security
contacts with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But since China began experimenting with an ``open door'' trade
policy in the mid-1980s, almost every major trading country _
including the United States _ has wanted to include China in the
WTO, the body that is the world's traffic cop and rule-setter on
exports and imports.
</P>
<P>
   But China's application needs the approval of all 134 member
nations and regions that make up the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising, something has
always popped up at the last minute to block China's admission.
This spring, the accidental American bombing of the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia caused China to
break off expert-level talks with the United States on the issue
for five months.
</P>
<P>
   While American businesses are cheerleading for China's
admission, Clinton must face the political realities of an
anti-China bias in the run-up to the next presidential election.
The Democrats risk continued bashing by Republicans _ on
allegations of Chinese government spying and illegal political
contributions _ if China gains entry to the WTO on what look like
too-favorable terms.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Jiang cannot come home with an agreement that
looks like a cave-in to America. Especially now, on the eve of the
50th anniversary of the communist revolution on Oct. 1, he cannot
afford the appearance that Chinese pride and power have been
punctured.
</P>
<P>
   That's why his foreign affairs spokesman Zhu Bangzao said this
month, ``China will never sacrifice national interests for WTO
membership.''

BLACK GOLD: PEPPERCORNS ADD PUNCH TO COOKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ They're named after exotic locales such as
Malabar and Muntok, Tellicherry and Sarawak, but they are as common
as breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   They're peppercorns.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Christ, pepper was so coveted that it was traded
for gold.
</P>
<P>
   Pungent and spicy when whole, these dried berries of the Piper
Nigrum vine have a place in nearly every American kitchen and on
almost every American table.
</P>
<P>
   Peppercorns are found in three colors: black, white and green.
</P>
<P>
   Green peppercorns are the unripe berries of the plant. After
they have been harvested and blanched, they're usually dehydrated.
Sometimes, green peppercorns can be found canned in brine. Instead
of being hard, brined green peppercorns are soft and have a more
delicate flavor than their dried counterparts. They're also more
difficult to find. Look for them in the ethnic food sections of
large grocery stores or ask a specialty store to order them for
you.
</P>
<P>
   Black peppercorns are harvested before they have ripened but
instead of being blanched, they are fermented and left to dry in
the sun where they turn black and wrinkled. When ground or crushed,
black peppercorns release their familiar pungent aroma and flavor,
which, for the most part, is found in the outer, dark brown or
black skin.
</P>
<P>
   White peppercorns are black peppercorns that have been allowed
to ripen on the vine and then fermented and skinned. Since the skin
of the berry has been removed, so has much of the pepper's flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, the white peppercorns found in stores are actually
black peppercorns that have been hulled, or had their skins
removed. This type of white pepper is usually marked
``decorticated'' and tastes more like black pepper than white
pepper that has been allowed to ripen on the vine.
</P>
<P>
   Pink peppercorns aren't really peppercorns at all, but the dried
fruit of a different plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you hold a dry measure of 1/4 cup black peppercorns in one
hand, and an equal measure of pink ``peppercorns'' in the other
hand, you'll notice a substantial difference in weight between the
two spices. The black peppercorns are much heavier.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs usually keep both white and black pepper in the kitchen,
more for aesthetic reasons than taste differences. Like salt, white
pepper usually can't be seen when you're looking at a dish. Those
little flecks of black pepper, on the other hand, stand up and
announce ``I'm here, I'm here'' like a kid excited about the first
day of school.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes calling for pepper (the spice, not the vegetable) will
often specify ``freshly ground,'' and for good reason. Though whole
peppercorns will keep indefinitely if stored properly, they begin
to lose flavor and potency as soon as they are broken. Therefore,
it's best not to grind or crush peppercorns until you are ready to
use them. And, although ground black pepper is a staple in grocery
stores, it's best used for picnics, camping and other culinary
adventures when you want to reduce preparation to a minimum. It
simply lacks the pungent bite and the texture of freshly ground or
cracked pepper.

   BEATLES-YELLOWSUB _ Sometimes the dippiest notions have the

   CITY-OPERA-REVIVAL (New York) _ Last spring Paul Kellogg, the
general and artistic director of the New York City Opera, was in

million in subscriptions have been sold, a $1 million increase over

   PHOTOGRAPHY-EXHIBIT _ Despite talk of the rise of video or the
return of painting or the dominance of installation art, nothing in
the last three decades of art can match the triumph of photography.
Since the late 1960s, when it was put into play by Conceptual Art,
photography has changed the history of art and infiltrated every
other contemporary art medium while diversifying exponentially
within its own highly elastic boundaries. ``The Promise of
Photography: Selected Works from the Collection of the DG Bank'' at
the P.S. 1 Center for Contemporary Art in Long Island City is a big
genial show of work dating from the early 1960s to the present. By
Roberta Smith.

   NJ-PINE-BARRENS _ We were paddling an aluminum canoe under a
canopy of trees on a narrow river that wound through cedar-smelling
woods and swamps. The banks were mossy and dark. It could have been
the Bayou or parts of the Everglades. But this unbroken forest, one
of the largest on the East Coast, was within an hour of
Philadelphia and two hours of New York City, in the New Jersey Pine
Barrens. By Peter Van Allen. (With a photo.)

   WIT-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ For several years, Judith Light
was a star of ``Who's the Boss?,'' a popular sitcom on ABC. The
show had a silly, made-for-each-other premise: Light played a
Connecticut advertising executive and single mother who hired Tony
Danza as a live-in housekeeper and babysitter for her son. As the
star of ``Wit,'' Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama,
shows Light to be much more than a sitcom refugee. By Peter Marks.

   MIDEAST-PEACE _ BEITUNIA, West Bank _ Scenes of weeping men and
jubilant family reunions Thursday illustrated new peace process
momentum, as Israel turned over prisoners and land to the
Palestinians. These were the first tangible steps of the peace
agreement signed last weekend. Coming a few days ahead of schedule,
they, at least momentarily, diminished the disappointment
Palestinians feel in a peace process plagued by delays. A handful
of Israelis protested the release of men they consider terrorists,
but, at homes throughout the occupied territories, Palestinians
were firing gunshots and slaughtering sheep in honor of their
returning heroes. Next, Israel is supposed to open a route for
Palestinians to travel between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
Oct. 1 and release 150 more prisoners Oct. 8. (Kaplow, Cox News

   MEXICO-PRI _ MEXICO CITY _ Mexicans never saw anything like it
before. Two top presidential contenders from the same party sparred
bitterly during a historic debate Wednesday night. The debate was
among the four contenders for the presidential nomination
representing Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI. Former Tabasco Gov. Roberto Madrazo, who is running a campaign
against his own party's record, came out a clear winner according
to overnight polls. Analysts say he is the man to watch. But will
he continue an aggressive campaign or fade under pressure from the
party elite? (Ferriss, Cox News Service)

   BRITAIN-FOXHUNT _ LONDON _ The age-old pastime of fox hunting is
now under attack by animal rights advocates who believe the sport
is brutal and archaic. Proponents say it's just good outdoor fun
for everyone, except maybe the foxes. British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's government is considering a ban on the sport. (Roughton,

IN THEIR WORLD, JOHN LENNON WAS ALWAYS DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Back when people my age were young and not in
charge of anything, we sometimes liked to list all the innovations
and changes that old people who were born at the turn of the
century had seen during their lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   You know, like ``They were born when most people got around by
horse and carriage, but lived to see men walk on the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, in Wisconsin the staff at little Beloit College (student
pop. 1,150) came up with a variation on that theme, only it's
reversed. To provide faculty and anybody else who needs it with a
snapshot of the Class of 2003, the school has compiled its second
annual list of ``ways in which entering first-year students differ
in their frame of reference.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Beloit researcher Richard Miller, the list is ``not
meant to be serious research,'' just a bit of food for thought.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the effect it's had on everyone I've shown it to is to
make them feel very, very old.
</P>
<P>
   For example, most of the first-year students this year did not
exist in the '70s. The majority were born in 1981. In addition:
``They are the first generation born into Luvs, Huggies and
Pampers.''
</P>
<P>
   For them, ``John Lennon and John Belushi have always been
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   They do not know a U.S. Supreme Court without at least one woman
justice on it. Likewise, the only space program they know has
always had female astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   ```Cats' has been on Broadway all their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They never heard anyone say, `Book 'em, Dano,' `Good night,
John-boy,' or `Kiss my grits,' in prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   For them, ``Yugoslavia has never existed.''
</P>
<P>
   That staple on airplanes and outside hotel room doors _ USA
Today _ was born the same year they were.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot remember a time when labor strikes were not ``a
routine part of professional athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   If they've needed ibuprofen, they never had to wait for a doctor
to write a prescription for it. So, too, they have never had to
worry about the safety of Tylenol packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the common use of the phrase, ``They have no idea how
big a breadbox is.''
</P>
<P>
   While they may get offers each week to apply for their own
credit card, they have never seen a BankAmericard.
</P>
<P>
   Neither have they seen video of white smoke over the Vatican nor
do they ``know its significance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably never dialed a phone or opened an icebox.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the sophomores a year ahead of them, most students in the
Class of 2003 were still in grade school when the Soviet Union
imploded and fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, the '02 and '03 kids have always had cable TV, watched
the ``Tonight Show'' with only Jay Leno as host, really remember
only one president and never had to deal with hard contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   While they may remember ``what Michael Jackson looked like
before his nose fell off,'' they have only known him as a white
guy.
</P>
<P>
   They never heard Walter Cronkite end a live news broadcast with,
``That's the way it is,'' nor do any of the following phrases mean
much to them: ``Where's the beef?'' ``I'd walk a mile for a
Camel.'' ``Boss, de plane, de plane.''
</P>
<P>
   They do not know a time when the word ``adult'' did not signify
something dirty. And, ``They cannot imagine waiting a generation to
get the dirt on the U.S. president.''

 &HT;    No sixth sense needed to solve bleary whodunit
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Besides having the wooziest title of the year, the movie ``Stir
of Echoes'' also has the worst timing. It might have seemed
intriguing had it landed in theaters before ``The Blair Witch
Project'' and ``The Sixth Sense'' gave us new twists on the spooky
movie genre. But after a compelling first half, the main echoes
that this ghost yarn stirs up are of other movies.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest parallels are with ``Close Encounters of the Third
Kind'' and ``The Shining,'' focusing on average dads whose
collision with the paranormal results in obsessive acts and family
tension. (It seems likely that Steven Spielberg and Stephen King,
both fans of writer Richard Matheson, may have ``borrowed'' bits
from his 1950s novel, from which this movie is adapted.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Echoes'' also recalls ``Sixth Sense'' in its focus on a little
boy (Zachary David Cope) who sees ghosts. In particular, he chats
with the spirit of a teenage girl haunting his parents' home. After
his sister-in-law (the reliably sardonic Illeana Douglas)
hypnotizes the boy's blue-collar father, Tom (Kevin Bacon), as a
party game, Pops also glimpses this phantom of a neighborhood girl
who mysteriously disappeared six months ago. Soon enough, Tom is
skipping work and digging up the back yard as he tries to find her
body. Unfortunately, it's all too easy to suss out whodunit, if not
why, as the screenplay introduces a small group of supporting
players (including Kathryn Erbe, strong in the thankless role of
Bacon's long-suffering wife).
</P>
<P>
   The cliched, TV-movie plot devices in the film's last half might
reassure audiences who smarted from the burn of that rug being
pulled out from under them in ``Sixth Sense.'' But for more
adventurous moviegoers, ``Echoes'' is strictly a second-rate
spooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stir
</P>
<P>
   of Echoes''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe. Rated R for violence,
sexuality and language. 1 hour, 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A ghost story with too many echoes of other flicks.

 &HT;    `Stigmata': Sensation without the sense
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those unfamiliar with the term ``stigmata,'' it refers to a
phenomenon whereby a person replicates the wounds Jesus suffered on
the cross, i.e., he or she begins bleeding from the wrists, ankles,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with ``Stigmata'' is that it bleeds all over the
place, gushing snatches of everything from ``The Exorcist'' to
``The Omen.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) is an investigator for the
Vatican. A scientist-turned-priest who travels the world looking at
stuff like weeping statues of the Virgin Mary and oxidized paint
stains that somehow look like Christ, he's mostly encouraged by his
superior, Cardinal Houseman (Jonathan Pryce), to debunk alleged
miracles _ especially if they happen to challenge established
church doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   So when Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette), a young hairdresser
in Pittsburgh, starts showing signs of the stigmata in such very
public places as a subway car, Father Andrew is sent to ``contain''
the situation. But as the priests from ``The Exorcist'' could have
told him, some situations are more ``containable'' than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stigmata'' deserves points for its early scenes that offer an
intriguing contrast between religion and medicine, as various
doctors try to find a rational explanation for what's happening to
Frankie. There's also good work by Byrne, who's blessed with one of
those naturally compassionate faces, and by Nia Long as Arquette's
best friend (unfortunately, she inexplicably disappears about
halfway through the picture).
</P>
<P>
   Poor Arquette gets the brunt of all the bad stuff. So much so
that the film's target audience might best be described as anyone
who likes to see her bleed spontaneously, rush through traffic in a
downpour or suffer any number of humiliations and mutilations.
</P>
<P>
   What ``Stigmata'' suffers from is a bad case of late-1990s
moviemaking. That is, it prefers sensationalism to making sense.
</P>
<P>
   Basic to the problem: Just what kind of spirit has possessed
Frankie? Is it a champion of the truth or a nasty demon who enjoys
messing with her? Apparently the filmmakers couldn't decide, so
they tried having it both ways. It's enough to make you nostalgic
for the good ol' days of pea soup and spinning heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stigmata''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne. Directed by Rupert
Wainwright. Rated R for intense violent sequences, language and
some sexuality. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Let it bleed without you.

 &HT;    A tale of two brothers, `Falls' surreal but affecting
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're used to brilliant brother acts in the movies these days.
Everyone from the Coens and the Hughes to the Farrellys and the
Wachowskis. But the competition hasn't fazed brothers Mark and
Michael Polish, whose debut feature, ``Twin Falls Idaho,'' is one
of the most strikingly original films of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Identical twins making their directing (Michael), writing (both)
and acting (both) debut, the brothers have created a haunting tale
of togetherness and alienation, love and loneliness. They play
Blake (Mark) and Francis (Michael) Falls, conjoined twins _ the
popular term, ``Siamese twins,'' was foisted on the public by P.T.
Barnum _ who share three arms, two legs and who knows how many
internal organs.
</P>
<P>
   We first encounter them at the sort of seedy hotel that exists
in something like Barton Fink's dreams. Penny (Michele Hicks), a
young prostitute, has been summoned to their room by Blake as a
``birthday present'' for Francis. Don't ask. Penny certainly
doesn't. One look and she's gone. But later she returns to retrieve
her purse and finds Francis ill. She stays to help _ partly out of
compassion, partly out of curiosity. When she asks Blake why he
never gets sick, he replies, ``Who would take care of Francis?''
</P>
<P>
   Thus they become a kind of threesome. There are occasional
outings. To a Halloween party where the brothers' ``costume'' is
much admired. To seek out their mother (Lesley Ann Warren), who
gave them up at birth and still feels guilty (but not guilty enough
to welcome them back). But mostly the movie concentrates on their
strange _ and ultimately strained _ pas de trois as Penny
inevitably drives a wedge between the two. She and Blake are drawn
to each other, and Francis feels both jealous and abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twin Falls Idaho'' moves at its own slow, dreamily surreal
pace, with a decidedly David Lynch tone to the earlier scenes. But
subtly, the film changes from freak show to eerie fairy tale, in
which the true nature of being alone is conveyed through the
experiences of two people who've never been alone in their lives.
As Blake tells Penny, he feels lonely only ``the minute I wake up
and the minute I fall asleep. ... I try to toss them before they
get ahold of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The cinematography is as muted and hypnotically off-kilter as
the brothers' acting style. Growing up as identical twins, they
have an idea what it's like to be looked at, and they underplay _
yet underscore _ their inherent objectification skillfully.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Hicks' performance is from the Courtney Love-smudged
mascara school of acting. Intentionally or not, she provides a
jarring contrast to the hushed aura of delicate melancholia
surrounding the twins.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with its theme of split identity, the film has
neither a sad nor a happy ending. Bittersweet might be the best
word. Plus a guarded optimism that suggests that sometimes,
wholeness can be found only by letting go.

</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM)40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska:
</P>
<P>
   Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flicks. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
Ice Age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob
Longino)40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' R (sexuality, sexual dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a raunchy, throwaway, pre-adult, R-rated high school
sexcapade with dirty dialogue and more than one risque encounter
between students that's broadcast over the Internet. There's also
the grossest joke involving a beer you're likely ever to see on
film. Little in ``American Pie'' deserves honest laughs. (Bob
Longino)1 hour, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Better Than Chocolate'' Unrated, but contains nudity
</P>
<P>
   and sexual situations.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Wendy Crewson
</P>
<P>
   and Karyn Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   A sunny but badly scattered gay romantic comedy. The Canadian
comedy follows the love lives of a group of lesbians connected to a
bookstore called Ten Percent. Full of subplots, it's hard to
actively dislike. But like a puppy, it's sloppy and hyper and badly
in need of discipline. (SM) 1 hour, 43 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Heather Donahue,
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey into the kind of terror that comes from trying to
glimpse something in the shadows just beyond the campfire. Three
students head into the woods to document an 18th-century witch
tale, then disappear. The movie wrings chills out of the slightest
effects _ odd twiglike contraptions hanging from trees, a pile of
stones, strange noises in the night _ but its power comes from
psychological intensity. (SM)1 hour, 27 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger'' PG-13 (sex-related material
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin,
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin has come up with a beautiful premise for a movie.
Martin plays a hapless Hollywood producer with a stinky script and
a gem of a way to get it filmed with impossible-to-get megastar Kit
Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). ``Bowfinger's'' got a few good laughs but
not much more. Sadly, it never takes on Hollywood with the zing of
``Wag the Dog'' or ``The Player.''
</P>
<P>
   (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Chill Factor'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cuba Gooding Jr.
</P>
<P>
   and Skeet Ulrich.
</P>
<P>
   Summer's last-gasp action movie. There's a newfound deadly
chemical substance that'll blow and snuff out millions if not kept
cold. And two bickering heroes (Skeet Ulrich and Cuba Gooding Jr.)
who must keep military hooligans away from that chemical by
stuffing it inside an ice cream truck and putting pedal to the
metal. Unfortunately, ``Chill Factor'' doesn't have enough gas to
outgun its own concept. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 40 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Blue Sea'' R (excessive gore, dismemberment)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   There is precious little that is original about this movie. It
really doesn't matter, though. When the plot kicks in and the
killer shark starts prowling and munching, the film delivers all
the thrills, explosive action and sheer gore that audiences have
come to expect from the shark genre. (Hap Erstein, Cox News
Service) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   With subtitles
</P>
<P>
   Starring Thierry Lhermitte
</P>
<P>
   and Jacques Villeret.
</P>
<P>
   A feast of foolishness. A bunch of snotty Paris yuppies holds a
weekly dinner to see who can bring the biggest idiot as his guest.
Publisher Thierry Lhermitte thinks he's got a sure thing when he
meets Jacques Villeret, who builds scale-model monuments out of
matchsticks. But fate intervenes when Lhermitte throws out his back
and is forced to spend the evening with Villeret. (ERG)1 hour, 22
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley Do-Right'' PG (mild comic action violence,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser
</P>
<P>
   and Sarah Jessica Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley Do-Right'' is just plain wrongheaded. Based on one of
the weaker elements of Jay Ward's TV 'toon series ``The Bullwinkle
Show,'' this live-action takeoff has so much less to offer. Brendan
Fraser (``George of the Jungle'') plays Dudley and it's clear he'd
rather not be here. There's not one joke or one slapstick moment
that's funny. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 27 minutes (including a new
``Fractured Fairy Tales'' cartoon short). F+
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunting'' PG-13 (intense horror sequences)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Scary in all the worst ways. ``The Haunting'' is a Hollywood
debacle, an overpriced mess with only one scare in it. That scare
is of the old-fashioned ``boo'' variety. It has nothing to do with
the over-the-top computer effects that make this less a remake of
the 1963 classic than a theme park in search of a script. (SM) 1
hour, 53 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' PG-13 (brief nudity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rupert Everett, Cate Blanchett, Jeremy Northam and
Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   A less-than-ideal adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play. In 1895
London, a respected politician's public and private lives are
threatened by a devious blackmailer who knows a secret from his
past. The fine cast is stymied by director Oliver Parker's
literal-minded approach. What remains is a well-acted, very
well-appointed period piece that becomes more stifling and less
engaging as it goes along. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``In Too Deep'' R (profanity, sensuality, some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps and LL Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   A decent undercover-cop thriller highlighted by some smart
performances. Omar Epps is quite good as the detective, but LL Cool
J is a revelation as the ruthless drug kingpin, a monster made all
the scarier by his seeming benevolent charm. (SM)1 hour, 50
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' PG (wacky violence, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The best gag is the first one in Disney's big-screen version of
TV's popular animated part-human, part-machine, mucho-gizmo lawman.
Matthew Broderick is perfectly cast as Gadget. Rupert Everett goes
over the top as bad man Sanford Solex. Kids will enjoy watching
them both. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 20 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' PG (fantasy action and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Nice story for kids, nifty look for adults. In 1957, a giant
metal-eating robot crash-lands on Earth and is befriended by
9-year-old Hogarth. But the robot's trail of munched-on trucks and
grain silos attracts a super-paranoid government agent. The
interesting mix of voice talent in this animated film includes
Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's mom and Harry Connick Jr. as a
beatnik with seductive Elvis eyes. (ERG) 1 hour, 24 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Stinks'' R (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring French Stewart
</P>
<P>
   and Bridgette Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   And so does this movie. Playing like a revenge fantasy from
someone stung by a real-life palimony suit, writer-director Jeff
Franklin's misogynist diatribe miscasts irritating character actor
French Stewart as a TV writer about to marry his longtime
girlfriend Chelsea (Bridgette Wilson). She's a sexy parasite; he's
equally rancid. The movie has nothing to do with love. It's about
lust, lucre and well-paid losers. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' PG-13 (profanity, some violence
</P>
<P>
   and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant, James Caan
</P>
<P>
   and Jeanne Tripplehorn.
</P>
<P>
   An effete British auctioneer (Hugh Grant) experiences culture
clash when he finds himself married to the mob, literally. Call it
a sleeping-with-the-fish-out-of-water comedy. Grant's one-trick
performance as an elegant bumbler is treadworn. He's terrific at
it, yes. But it's time to show more range. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Muse'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone
</P>
<P>
   and Andie MacDowell.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Brooks wrote, directed and stars in this Hollywood fable
about a screenwriter who's ``lost his edge'' and is sent to an
honest-to-the-gods Muse (Sharon Stone) for inspiration. Stone is
delicious. She plays her Muse as a mix of material girl, expert
networker and distracted spoiled child. In other words, she's
modeled her after half of Hollywood. (ERG)1 hour, 37 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery Men'' PG-13 (comic action violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller, Geoffrey Rush,
</P>
<P>
   Hank Azaria and Janeane Garofalo.
</P>
<P>
   It's a spoof! It's an adventure! No, it's an amiable mess. Ben
Stiller and Janeane Garofalo headline a ragamuffin team of
superhero wannabes. But the movie is mostly like its hapless heroes
_ kind of clumsy and good intentioned but with none of the knack it
takes to save the day, or itself. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 1 minute. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside Providence'' R (teen drug use, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   sexual references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Shawn Hatosy
</P>
<P>
   and Alec Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Just ignore the Miramax marketing campaign. This movie may be
written by the ``There's Something About Mary'' gang, but it's
bittersweet funny, not raucous comedy. It's a coming-of-age tale of
a '70s Rhode Island teen (Shawn Hatosy) that captures the shaggy,
druggy ``what-next'' feeling that followed in the uncertain years
after the Summer of Love had come and gone. (SM) 1 hour, 42
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Run Lola Run'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Franka Potente
</P>
<P>
   and Moritz Bleibtreu.
</P>
<P>
   A pyrotechnic celebration of style over substance, this
adrenalin-fueled German flick is the big-screen love child of every
video game and MTV quick-cut editing trick of the past 10 years.
Franka Potente plays the flame-haired woman who has 20 minutes to
run through Berlin in search of 100,000 marks, or lose her lover.
In German with English subtitles. (SM) 1 hour, 21 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' PG (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, alas, doesn't strike twice in this reunion of
``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. However, the
film isn't a fiasco and it does well by its intended audience,
i.e., anyone who wants to see Roberts galloping on horseback in
full wedding regalia. She's a bride who's already choked at the
altar three times and is about to try again. He's a cynical
journalist who's betting she'll run. (ERG)1 hour, 56 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM)1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Stigmata'' R (profanity, sexuality, intense violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patricia Arquette
</P>
<P>
   and Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Let it bleed without you. This mishmash of ``The Exorcist,''
``The Omen,'' etc. stars Gabriel Byrne as a Vatican investigator
sent to examine a young woman (Patricia Arquette) who's showing
signs of the stigmata, the wounds suffered by Christ on the cross.
Unfortunately, the movie prefers sensationalism to making sense.
It's enough to make you long for the good ol' days of pea soup and
spinning heads. (ERG) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stir of Echoes'' R (profanity, sexual content and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon
</P>
<P>
   and Kathryn Erbe.
</P>
<P>
   A ghost story with too many echoes of other flicks. It might
have seemed intriguing had it landed in theaters before ``The Blair
Witch Project'' and ``The Sixth Sense'' gave us new twists on the
spooky movie genre. A little boy sees ghosts and his hypnotized dad
(Kevin Bacon) goes wiggy while hunting what happened to a teen girl
haunting their home. (SM)1 hour, 50 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop Making Sense'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Byrne,
</P>
<P>
   Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison
</P>
<P>
   and Tina Weymouth.
</P>
<P>
   This ain't no party, this ain't no disco, it's a milestone
concert film. Fifteen years after it first appeared, director
Jonathan Demme's ``Stop Making Sense'' hasn't lost a bit of its
energy and elegance. Though the members of Talking Heads have
acrimoniously parted ways, the movie preserves the band in their
prime, young and percolating with cross-cultural rhythms and their
early-'80s blend of joy and alienation. (SM)1 hour, 28 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   teen drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes, Barry Watson and Marisa
Coughlan.
</P>
<P>
   It barely makes a passing grade. Three high school kids take
their evil history teacher hostage in her home and then try to
figure out how to get out of the mess they've created. It ends up
being a wishy-washy remake of 1980's silly ``Nine to Five.'' As the
tied-up teach, Helen Mirren is pretty good. Her young co-stars,
however, fail to match her talent. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 35 minutes.
C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The 13th Warrior'' R (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Antonio Banderas.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes cheesy movies can be great fun. That's true of this
rip-roaring yarn about a medieval Arab poet (Antonio Banderas)
who's drafted by a roving gang of rowdy Vikings to help rescue a
Norse village from a mysterious enemy that comes from the mist,
kills everything in sight and leaves a trail of headless corpses.
This flick hits the ground running and never stops. (ERG) 1 hour,
43 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, but
lots of other gimmicks from the 1968 original have been excised.
That's good. This remake is a guilt-free summer diversion. Pierce
Brosnan is an appealing billionaire gentleman rogue, stealing
priceless paintings. But it's really Rene Russo's film. As the solo
investigator hot on his trail, she prowls the screen savoring a
smart, sexed-up character. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``trick'' R (sexuality, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christian Campbell
</P>
<P>
   and John Paul Pitoc.
</P>
<P>
   In this sturdy and well-acted gay romantic comedy, two guys
spend a night looking to make love in all the wrong places. Gabriel
(Christian Campbell) and Mark (John Paul Pitoc) pick each other up,
both clearly intending a mutually gratifying one-night stand. But
as the evening wears on, they're still on the street. The obstacles
become more contrived as the movie goes on. But, overall, ``trick''
is a minor treat. (ERG)1 hour, 30 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Twin Falls Idaho'' R (kinkiness and adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mark
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Polish.
</P>
<P>
   Eerie. Intriguing. Identical twins, Mark and Michael Polish,
play conjoined (the popular term is Siamese) twins. Moving at its
own slow, surreal pace, the picture shows what happens when a young
hooker (Michele Hicks) falls for one of the twins, thus creating a
strange pas de trois. Exploring themes of love and loneliness, the
movie suggests that sometimes, wholeness can only be found by
letting go. (ERG)1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Universal Soldier: The Return'' R (violence, profanity,
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, Michael Jai White and Bill
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   It's loud, it's brutal and, unfortunately, not packed with
enough fun. This is a return to Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1992
``Universal Soldier,'' in which dead military guys are turned into
chiseled, nearly unstoppable, cyborglike warriors. This time he's
got to battle wrestling's Bill Goldberg and a monstrously buffed
Michael Jai White. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 22 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some Imax films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Jill Vejnoska)41 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Xiu Xiu:
</P>
<P>
   The Sent-Down Girl'' R (strong sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lu Lu Lopsang.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Chen demonstrates a real director's touch in eliciting rich
performances in this tale of a Chinese girl relocated to the
Tibetan outback. Chen gets maximum effect from the gorgeous but
indifferent landscape of her locations. The story's emotional
bleakness will limit its appeal, but it's a rigorous piece of work.
Beautifully shot and acted but brutal in its view of human nature,
it's an art-house, feel-bad film. (SM)1 hour, 39 minutes. B

   The verdict: This ain't no party, this ain't no disco, it's just

</P>
<P>
   '80s concert film ages well
</P>
<P>
   By Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years after it first appeared (has it really been that
long?), director Jonathan Demme's wonderful concert film ``Stop
Making Sense'' hasn't lost a bit of its energy and elegance. Though
the members of Talking Heads have acrimoniously parted ways, the
movie preserves the band in its prime, young and percolating with
cross-cultural rhythms and their early-1980s blend of joy and
alienation.
</P>
<P>
   The main attraction is still Heads lead vocalist and provocateur
David Byrne, performing his special brand of geek aerobics.
Goggle-eyed, with a mop of black hair seeping full of sweat, bony
knees prodding the front of his slacks, he's an uncanny sight: a
nerdy dervish, song lyrics squeezing explosively out his throat as
from a long white toothpaste tube.
</P>
<P>
   Demme, working from Byrne's design for the live concert,
famously builds the concert one element at a time. First there is
Byrne, singing ``Psycho Killer'' on a bare stage, accompanied by a
boombox and his own guitar. One by one, band members Chris Frantz,
Jerry Harrison and Tina Weymouth appear, and the movie creates its
own sense of momentum. By the time Demme shrewdly aims his camera,
unmoving, on Byrne's hypnotic performance of ``Once in a
Lifetime,'' the movie has seized you in its percussive spell.

   The verdict: It stinks, all right.

<P>
   `Love' isn't all that stinks
</P>
<P>
   By Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Stinks,'' and so does this movie. Playing like a revenge
fantasy from someone stung by a real-life palimony suit,
writer-director Jeff Franklin's misogynist diatribe miscasts
irritating character actor French Stewart as our leading man. He
plays TV writer Seth, whom we meet en route to Las Vegas to marry
longtime girlfriend Chelsea (Bridgette Wilson).
</P>
<P>
   Structured as a long flashback, the movie presents Chelsea as a
sex-for-jewelry opportunist, a gold-digging sociopath. ``Just buy
me a ring, that would shut me up,'' she tells Seth after nagging
him about commitment. After a year of live-in dating, realizing
that Seth is content with their vow-free status, she sues him for
half his earnings, refuses to leave his house and turns the movie
into what ``The War of the Roses'' would have been had it been made
with the tin ear and empty laughs of a sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea and best pal Holly (a wooden Tyra Banks) are written as
sexy parasites, defined entirely by their need to be married. The
movie is at least equal opportunity, in making Seth and his pal
Larry (Bill Bellamy) seem equally rancid.
</P>
<P>
   The title is a misnomer. This movie has nothing to do with love;
it's about lust, lucre and well-paid losers.

   A venue fit for vast `Alaska'
</P>
<P>
   By Bob Longino
</P>
<P>
   The sheer size of the latest Imax offering, ``Alaska: Spirit of
the Wild,'' sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just one of those languid Discovery Channel-style nature
flicks to fill a boring Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Giant blocks of blue ice, some equal in heft to a 30-story
building, crack and crash into otherwise calm waters. An even
calmer sea dramatically erupts as a humpback whale leaps from below
the surface to arch, as gracefully as a multi-ton creature can,
into the air.
</P>
<P>
   These infrequent moments in the 1997 documentary ``Alaska,''
nominated for an Oscar last year, are powerful stuff and cool to
see, especially on one of the biggest screens around. And when they
happen, they mask narration that sounds as if it's been lifted
right out of an elementary school textbook.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-minute film spans millenniums in record time _ and throws
in bits and pieces about the Ice Age, the northern lights, the
Klondike gold rush, the annual Iditarod sled race, glaciers, salmon
spawning, caribou hunting, seals and bears (brown, black and
polar).

 &HT;    MEXICO GETS COMIC RELIEF AS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HIT
TELEVISION TALK SHOW CIRCUIT
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Sept. 11 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Manuel Bartlett confessed to cheating on a French
exam so he could get a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox took off his trademark belt buckle to screams of joy
from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Porfirio Munoz Ledo shook his shoulders in a shimmy to
demonstrate that he's got rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   These men are all competing to become the next president of
Mexico. And for the first time in the history of this country's
normally stodgy political culture, they're willing to do the
unthinkable to get votes. With two notable exceptions who fear for
their dignity, all candidates vying for next year's highly
competitive presidential election are reaching out by appearing on
David Letterman and Jay Leno-style talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of offering canned speeches, they're talking about their
families and foibles and engaging in snappy repartee. They're
guffawing at off-color jokes and participating in unscripted
hijinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A president should be able to handle a talk show appearance as
well as he handles a guerrilla uprising in Chiapas,'' said Adal
Ramones, a comic and television host whose freewheeling live chats
with candidates this month have electrified the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the candidates who've appeared on the show have said this
is another Mexico now. Things have changed and the president can't
be untouchable, even when it comes to gags,'' said Ramones, whose
show ``Otro Rollo,'' or ``A Different Thing,'' reaches tens of
millions of viewers tuned into the Televisa network.
</P>
<P>
   All this is happening in a country where just a year and a half
ago police commandos stormed factories producing rubber masks of
President Ernesto Zedillo. The Attorney General said the factories
were violating copyright laws, but everybody knew the crackdown was
because Mexico has unwritten rules that no one dare mock the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Slapstick comic Eugenio Dervez, who also invited Fox to appear
on his show, chalked up today's more relaxed mood to a big thaw
melting down Mexico's rigid political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of campaigning has never happened before in
Mexico,'' Dervez said. ``I think this is a great opening of
democracy and freedom of expression in this country. And what the
candidates want now is a big screen and big ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   The rash of television appearances precedes the first ever
primary election to be held on Nov. 7 by Mexico's ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. All of Mexico's
presidents for the past 70 years have been PRI apparatchiks. And
presidents have always hand-picked who would run as their
successors.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, it was common for the PRI's candidates to never
before have run for office. They were often fairly unknown to the
Mexican people and the press usually shied away from digging beyond
the candidate's official portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   But competitors for the PRI's upcoming nomination _ especially
the two front runners _ are locked in a fierce media battle.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who belongs to the conservative National Action Party, is
already in the mix because he is running such a competitive
campaign in a bid to win Mexico's July 2000 general election.
</P>
<P>
   The only two prominent presidential contenders who have so far
snubbed Ramones' invitation to ``Otro Rollo'' are Francisco
Labastida, who is widely regarded as the PRI elite's favorite
choice for the party's nomination, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who is
expected to be the left's candidate. The two are basing their
campaigns on an image of solemn character and analysts say they
fear doing comedy would undermine their strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Ramones said Labastida was the first to be invited to ``Otro
Rollo,'' but he declined after his campaign advisers found out he'd
be on the same show as his chief rival in the PRI, Roberto Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he missed a great opportunity,'' Ramones said, noting
that all the candidates on his show have received mostly favorable
press coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting aside the Lewinsky matter,'' Ramones added, ``(U.S.)
President Clinton didn't lose any of his seriousness by going on a
talk show and playing the sax. He showed he was versatile and that
he was close to the people he would govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is still considering Ramones' offer, according to
sources in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who appeared on ``Otro Rollo'' on last Tuesday, used the
show to trash his rivals for turning down Ramones' invitation.
After talking about his children and his beloved ranch _ and
strapping his belt around his leg like a gun holster _ Fox pulled
out two pairs of jeans decorated with his own campaign slogans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are for those two who wouldn't go on the show,'' he
said, prompting gales of laughter from the studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   The week before his appearance on ``Otro Rollo,'' Fox appeared
on Dervez's show in a prepared comedy sketch _ something no other
candidate has dared to do. Fox was ``interviewed'' by a character
Dervez plays who resembles Jerry Lewis' nutty professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When are you going to stop already? It sounds like you're
already rehearsing your state-of-the-union speech,'' Dervez yelled
at Fox, interrupting him as the candidate, feigning seriousness,
introduced himself to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the same night that Dervez's show aired
President Zedillo gave his annual state-of-the-union address. While
Zedillo's speech captured only about 6.5 percent of Mexico's
television audience, Fox attracted more than 40 percent of all
viewers a couple of hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``All interviews are valuable,'' Fox said when asked why he
submitted to doing comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's appearance on Dervez's show was so unusual for a
politician that Mexico City's Reforma newspaper conducted a poll to
gauge public reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents were slightly in favor of politicians going on
comedy shows. But regardless of their opinions, most admitted
they'd opted to tune in to Dervez's show that night while skipping
their president.
</P>
<P>
   Only 29 percent respondents told Reforma they'd seen Zedillo's
speech while 51 percent said they'd seen Fox on Dervez's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that there's real political competition in Mexico,
politicians will have to go to the people rather than expecting the
people to come to them,'' said Sergio Sarmiento, news director for
TV Azteca, a Televisa rival network.
</P>
<P>
   Ramones thinks the candidates' eagerness for exposure is a
healthy sign for the media to get more aggressive with politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates all bounded onto his show like celebrities,
entering though a door to a fanfare of flashing lights and a burst
of rock music. Ramones engaged them in small talk and jokes.
Finally, with exaggerated respect, he asked each candidate if he
could break with tradition and poke fun at him should he become
president.
</P>
<P>
   Cornered by Ramones, every candidate who has appeared on ``Otro
Rollo'' has instantly agreed to be the butt of gags and sketches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course!'' said Madrazo, a 47-year-old PRI candidate who is
running as an alternative to the old-fashioned PRI. ``Go ahead.
Your humor brings us closer to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo showed Ramones a few karate moves on the show. Then,
without Madrazo knowing what he was about to do, Ramones asked the
candidate to grab a blender on a coffee table and whip up a
smoothie using milk, sugar, chocolate and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexican slang, eggs, or ``huevos'' means testicles. Ramones
used the eggs as a prop to make a humorous reference to Madrazo's
audacious attacks on his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the others think they can compete with me!'' Madrazo said
gamely, as he blended the ingredients into froth.
</P>
<P>
   Ramones had other plans for Porfirio Munoz Ledo, Cardenas'
underdog competitor for the leftist nomination. He forced a
chortling Munoz Ledo to watch a parade of bikini-clad women
modeling various jackets and shirts Mexican presidents
traditionally wear.
</P>
<P>
   When PRI contender Manuel Bartlett appeared, Ramones made him
demonstrate on slow-motion camera how a politician properly grips
hands and slaps backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics aren't the way they used to be here,'' Ramones said,
explaining his ground-breaking show. ``Television is no longer
simply a means of communicating the official line.''

 &HT;    Allergy alert: Ragweed season revving up
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Does a slice of cold, dribbling watermelon cause a
twitch after you bite into it?
</P>
<P>
   Then you may be allergic to ragweed, the fall-pollinating plant
that's heading toward its seasonal peak production of misery.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, metro Atlanta's pollen count was 56, after hitting
70 on Tuesday, more than double the previous week. Misery should be
full-blown by next week. Counts of 61 to 120 are ``high,'' anything
above is considered ``extremely high,'' a range within the region's
reach should the stale weather pattern prevail.
</P>
<P>
   People bothered by ragweed often notice their mouth feels itchy
after eating cantaloupe or watermelon. That's because these melons
cross-react with ragweed, creating an allergy symptom that's not
dangerous but helps pinpoint a patient's complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the other day, I had a woman tell me she felt her mouth
itched after eating cantaloupe and I told her, `I bet you're
allergic to ragweed,''' said Dr. Kathleen Sheerin of the Atlanta
Allergy and Asthma Clinic. Allergy skin-testing almost always
proves Sheerin's guess correct.
</P>
<P>
   Rain, wind or a sudden drop in temperature can temporarily lower
the pollen count. But until then, it's prime time for pollen.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we continue to not have rain, and to have high smog
levels, we will continue to have high ragweed counts,'' Sheerin
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, ragweed season lasts through mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   For seasonal allergy sufferers, the plant is a hay fever
heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both qualitatively and quantitatively, it's more bothersome
than tree pollen,'' said Dr. Kevin Schaffer of Lawrenceville's
Allergy &AMP; Asthma Center.
</P>
<P>
   A ragweed pollen count of 20 _ 20 grains per cubic meter of air
_ is as bothersome as tree pollen counts of 200. One ragweed plant
can generate 1 billion grains.
</P>
<P>
   Four-footed types get a double whammy. Not only do dogs and
outdoor cats traipse it indoors on their coats, exposing owners,
but many also sniff, sneeze and snivel themselves. ``With animals,
sometimes allergy symptoms are runny eyes and nose and sometimes
it's itchy skin,'' said Dr. Sharon Tamplin of PetSmart in Dunwoody,
Ga.
</P>
<P>
   But don't invite those pollen-loaded pets to share your pillow
out of sympathy, Sheerin warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sleep with your cat or dog, you're sleeping with a fur
ball full of ragweed.''
</P>

ESPRIT DE CORP'S CEO RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCSICO _ Jay Margolis, Esprit de Corp.'s chairman and
chief executive officer since 1996, has told employees he is
resigning his post at the clothing company, the company announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal announcement made to all employees Tuesday,
Margolis said he had decided not to renew his contract with the
firm, which had expired recently. He also said he would stay on
with Esprit until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Margolis assured employees that his leaving
would have no effect on their jobs. Management went on to say the
company is doing well this year, a vast improvement from last year,
according to a source at Esprit.
</P>
<P>
   Margolis could not be reached for comment. He is resigning both
as chairman and as CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Margolis is generally given credit by industry watchers for
revitalizing once-proud Esprit's retail and catalog sales since he
took the helm in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak in 1989, San Francisco-based Esprit had 80 stores
and discount outlets around the country. Esprit currently has 20
stores nationwide. The company's oversized, colorful catalogs were
a must-have for the trendy and style-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Esprit, which some analysts have credited with creating the
junior apparel industry, was a powerhouse brand in the 1970s and
early 1980s, with its brightly colored, sporty clothing and
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1980s, a host of factors began to drag the
company down.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts pointed to founders Doug and Susie Tompkins as the main
cause of Esprit's decline. The couple founded the company in 1968.
By the mid-'80s, analysts said, the Tompkinses _ who were then
having marital difficulties and finally divorced _ had let their
personal problems distract them from making sound business
decisions for Esprit.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't, for example, decide on a direction for the
company: Should Esprit follow its original customer base and create
more mature clothing styles, or should it continue to target teens?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other junior apparel companies began flooding the
market. Esprit responded by copying them, which confused customers.
Production costs also spiraled out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Esprit posted its first loss in 1987. From there on in, it was a
steady decline until the Tompkinses left.
</P>
<P>
   In October of 1996, the Tompkinses sold their interests in the
company's Asian and European operations to Michael Ying, an Esprit
partner in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Esprit's U.S. arm arranged a debt-for-equity exchange with
creditors Oaktree Capital Management and Cerberus Partners, which
are now controlling shareholders. Margolis was also an equity
investor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to opening new stores and reviving its catalog,
Esprit began targeting a slightly older customer _ women aged 19 to
30 as opposed to preteens and teens _ by offering higher quality
and slightly more expensive clothes.
</P>
<P>
   CEO Margolis had described Esprit's new apparel design and
market niche as ``more contemporary than the Gap but less expensive
than Banana Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that initiative, Esprit has stabilized, largely attributed
to Margolis' vision in the fields of advertising and catalog
design.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the company announced a national advertising
campaign costing an estimated $5 million to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign _ running in magazines like Elle, Cosmopolitan and
Glamour _ is being handled by Toth Brand Imaging, of New York and
Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to joining Esprit, Margolis was president of Tommy
Hilfiger, the popular teen sportswear company based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, he spent a decade growing Liz Claiborne's sales
from $550 million to $2.2 billion.

Since the late 1960s, when it was put into play by Conceptual Art,
photography has changed the history of art and infiltrated every
other contemporary art medium while diversifying exponentially
within its own highly elastic boundaries. ``The Promise of
Photography: Selected Works from the Collection of the DG Bank'' at
the P.S. 1 Center for Contemporary Art in Long Island City is a big
genial show of work dating from the early 1960s to the present. By
Roberta Smith.

star of ``Wit,'' Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama,
shows Light to be much more than a sitcom refugee. By Peter Marks.

PARCELLS SAYS HE'S FOCUSED ON THRASHING PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects number of ex-Patriots still with Jets, in 14th graf.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ While the questions about That Subject
confronted him as inevitably as unsolicited Bob Kraft suggestions
once did, Bill Parcells's facial expression remained impassive. His
vocal inflection never wavered.
</P>
<P>
   No, sir. Let the Patriots worry about suffering a relapse of
testosterone overload Sunday at the Meadowlands in their latest
reunion/grudge match with their old boss and his New York Jets.
Parcells is having none of it. Never has.
</P>
<P>
   All this babble about Tuna Bowls and one-upmanship and poetic
justice that has engulfed each Patriots-Jets clash since Parcells's
acrimonious departure from New England for his beloved New Jersey
in the wake of his 1996 Super Bowl season? That's somebody else's
game. Parcells isn't playing. And if he's hiding his true emotions,
his demurrals certainly sound sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really looked at it from that perspective,'' he
told the New York media and one Boston interloper Wednesday as the
fifth renewal of hostilities approached. ``I understand (the
buildup), but I've never been caught up in it. I never did look at
it as a personal thing. That was somebody else. Nobody knew what
was in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   What's in his heart is an unquenchable desire to beat the
stuffing out of the Patriots, but not for gloating purposes.
Parcells is too pragmatic, too obsessed with immediate objectives,
to worry about the nonessentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our opener and we don't want to start out 0-2 like we did
last year,'' he said of his defending AFC East champions and
conference playoff runners-up. ``They're a quality team in what top
to bottom is a very tough division. Offensively, they have a lot of
firepower _ top-flight receivers, quarterback, and tight end.
Defensively, they have a couple of top-of-the-line players.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's all that matters _ the strength of the opponent, not
its identity nor its psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought the Patriots' admitted overemphasis on
showing up their former coach would detract from their efforts _ as
it seems to have done while they've lost three of four meetings the
past two years _ Parcells said, ``I don't think so. I can't worry
about anyone other than my team. I'm just trying to put the best
team on the field I can for this week. That's all I worry about.
I'll worry about next week next week.''
</P>
<P>
   He presented a variation on that theme immediately after his
Long Island dissertation when he hooked up in a teleconference with
the Boston media at Foxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He offered a tribute to Drew Bledsoe, the quarterback he
alternately browbeat and coddled to stardom in New England. ``I'm
really pleased for Drew,'' he said. That provided a natural lead-in
to a question about whether Parcells would try to wreak havoc on
Bledsoe's thought process, as he reputedly has done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The scoff fairly crackled through the phone line. ``All that
stuff,'' said Parcells. ``I just don't believe in any of that. I'm
not the one playing. The players are playing.''
</P>
<P>
   And the press is hyping. So Parcells next took the opportunity
to dismiss the Tuna tempest before a new audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been kind of spiraling downward,'' he said. ``The
media makes more of it than really exists. There's not that many
players left in New England (who played for Parcells). And there's
not that many players from New England here. Hey, it holds its own
course.''
</P>
<P>
   He was partially accurate. The Patriots Alumni Association in
New York has been reduced to five _ Curtis Martin, Tom Tupa, Otis
Smith, Mike Gisler, and Ray Lucas _ with the offseason departures
of Scott Zolak, Corwin Brown, and Keith Byars. It's not that
Parcells isn't nostalgic. But business is business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corwin Brown is a special kid; I have strong feelings for
him,'' said Parcells. ``Keith, too. It's hard. But you have to move
on. I'm not saying it's over. I'm not saying they won't be back.
But you have to do what you think is best to get ready for this
week.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where Parcells's math is awry. This week the Patriots
roster includes 24 members who either played for Parcells in 1996
or were on the practice squad. No wonder his successor in
Foxborough, Pete Carroll, has attributed his club's failure against
the Jets to hypertension _ or that the Patriots coach seems to be
foaming at the mouth to settle the score or at least make it more
respectable.
</P>
<P>
   That's news to Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you're talking about is some perception,'' he said. ``So I
can't say.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to anymore. The results speak for themselves.

 &HT;    CELEBRATION GREETS PRISONER RELEASE AS PEACE PROCESS RESUMES
 &HT;    500&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEITUNIYA, West Bank _ Men wept with joy and families held
jubilant reunions as Israel resumed the long-stalled peace process
Thursday by releasing 199 Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The release was the first tangible step of a peace agreement
signed with much fanfare last weekend. Coming a day ahead of
schedule, it appeared to restore, if only slightly, Palestinian
confidence in a peace process plagued by delays.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was expected late Thursday or Friday, when Israel
would grant partial Palestinian control over another 7 percent of
land in the Arab West Bank, captured by Israel in 1967. Maps of the
transfer were awaiting approval from Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   That transfer will be followed by two more steps aimed at
rectifying the family separations caused by decades of conflict:
Opening a route for Palestinians to travel between the Gaza Strip
and the West Bank Oct. 1; and releasing 150 more prisoners Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Gaza Strip and West Bank Thursday, Palestinians
fired their pistols and slaughtered sheep in honor of their freed
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   When Samir Mansur, 38, reached his home in the village of Biddo,
he hugged his children for the first time in eight years. He had
been jailed for activism in the Democratic Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, a militant anti-Israeli group.
</P>
<P>
   In a living room where Mansur's picture hangs near a rendering
of Cuban revolutionary Che Guevera, 10-year-old daughter Bayan,
wept as she clung to her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jews killed us. We killed the Jews,'' Mansur said, after
covering Bayan's head in kisses. ``Now, we are opening a new
page.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mansur's family was reunited, another one was starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the greatest happiness of my life,'' said Salma Ibrihim
Faraj, 26, as she waited to greet Nasser Nuri Abu Aishi. They got
engaged eight years ago, shortly before he was jailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he would be in prison forever,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional Islamic modesty, Faraj waited while her Abu
Aishi hugged and wept with two male friends. Then, he approached
and give Faraj a kiss on each cheek before they shook hands. They
hope to be married in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes were a badly needed boost for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of U.S. mediators, the process was halted in
January by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said the
Palestinians were not doing enough to fight terror.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Thursday's group killed other Palestinians who
collaborated with Israel, but Israel refuses to release anyone
convicted of killing Israelis or anyone whose crime came after the
Oslo peace process was signed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Israelis Thursday protested the release of the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must fight terrorism. What is happening today is immoral,''
said Dov Kalmonovitz, a 42-year-old Israeli accountant. He has been
badly scarred since January 1988, when a Palestinian-thrown Molotov
cocktail burned him over most of his body.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   New Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak promised to hurry to peace
with the Palestinians, but Palestinians remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   He angered them with his insistence on renegotiating the Wye
River Memorandum, signed by Netanyahu in October. Barak and Arafat
completed the new deal revising Wye last week.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians complained that they were tired of ceremonies and
wanted results _ such as prisoner releases and Israeli troops
moving off predominantly Arab land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The release of this group and the redeployment gives some hope
for the people that there is a new government in Israel that is
going to carry out the agreement,'' said Marwan Barghouti, a
Palestinian legislator and cousin of two men in prison for killing
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Most Palestinian families have relatives who are, or were, in
Israeli jails and they consider them prisoners of war. Many
complained that another 2,000 remain behind bars and Israel will
only release 150 more under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The release Thursday was supposed to cover 200 prisoners. One
man, just a week from completing his sentence, refused the release
asking that his slot be used by another.
</P>
<P>
   Those released Thursday were gathered at dawn and made to sign
statements renouncing violence. Some were serving life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds jumped at the sides of their buses to shake and kiss
their hands. Bands played bagpipes to their arrival at Palestinian
police stations.
</P>
<P>
   Groom-to-be Abu Aishi was in jail for killing a Palestinian
collaborator. Now, he said, he hopes to work for the Palestinian
Authority _ as do many former prisoners _ and ``fight the
occupation in peaceful ways.''

`I WOKE UP EARLY THE DAY I DIED': ZANY CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN
AUTEUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's what must have happened. A lot of talented, relatively
famous people in Hollywood who loved Ed Wood's work _ or at least
loved the 1994 Tim Burton movie ``Ed Wood,'' about the proud auteur
of some of the absolutely worst films of the 1950s _ heard about
this project and signed on for the sheer fun of it. The idea sounds
fabulous: filming a long-lost script of Wood's, which he had
planned as a silent movie, just the way he would have wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   It would be so satisfying to report that the result, ``I Woke Up
Early the Day I Died,'' was a delight, an instant cult classic, a
masterpiece of camp. But it isn't. It's sad and misguided and
boring. Pretending to make a pathetically amateurish movie isn't
nearly as effective as accidentally making one because you don't
know any better.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Billy Zane as the thief, a mental patient who dresses up
as a nurse (good start) to escape from the institution, then pulls
off a robbery of a loan company. Here are Tippi Hedren, as the
widow of a deceased employee of the loan company, Sandra Bernhard,
as a stripper, Christina Ricci, as a teen-age prostitute, and Ron
Perlman, as the cemetery caretaker, not to mention Karen Black, Ann
Magnuson, Andrew McCarthy, John Ritter, Rick Schroder and Vampira.
Eartha Kitt performs at a nightclub; there is no dialogue in the
film, but there are screams, sobs, sound effects, a musical
soundtrack and Ms. Kitt's singing voice. Ed Wood's widow, Kathleen,
even has a tiny role. Other than Zane, most of the actors are in
only a scene or two each.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the plot revolves around the thief's loss of his
ill-gotten gains (the briefcase with the proceeds falls into a
coffin, which slams shut just as the thief is knocked cold and
falls into an open grave) and his efforts to recover it. Bagpipes,
tuning forks, the car jacking of a Checker taxi and a nighttime
cemetery scene play their parts.
</P>
<P>
   This is the feature-film debut of the director, Aris Iliopulos,
who does make good, humorous use of some black-and-white footage
from the 1950's. And the film has one nice comic moment, when
Zane's character is smothering another character with a pillow. But
Ed Wood would have made it even funnier.

`EARTH': INDIA TORN APART, AS A CHILD SEES IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Deepa Mehta's sorrowful film ``Earth,'' the second in a
projected trilogy of fire, earth and water, is bathed in a deep
golden light that at moments recalls the orange sky silhouetting
the sweaty faces of Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable in ``Gone With the
Wind'' during the burning of Atlanta. This amber glow gives the
film, which remembers the tragic events surrounding the partition
of India in 1947, a ruddy twilit sensuality along with a sense of
nocturnal foreboding.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the film, as Hindus and Muslims who have lived
together peacefully in the (now Pakistani) city of Lahore, begin
butchering one another and setting fires, you have a sinking
feeling of helplessness. Now that the evil genie of suppressed
ethnic hatred has been let out of the bottle and the cycle of
eye-for-an-eye violence and retaliation has begun, there is no
turning back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earth,'' adapted from Bapsi Sidhwa's semi-autobiographical
novel ``Cracking India,'' views these events through the eyes of
8-year-old Lenny Sethna (Maia Sethna) the pampered daughter of an
affluent Parsee family in Lahore. The Parsee community, descended
from Muslims who fled Persia in the ninth century, became closely
aligned with the British colonialists in India. During the
partition they avoided persecution by adopting a neutral stance
that Lenny's father compares to Switzerland's neutrality during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at major historical events through the eyes of a child
has its advantages and disadvantages. There's nothing like an
innocent child's-eye perspective on adult violence to underline its
tragic and senseless aspects. One of the film's most stunning
moments occurs after a train has arrived in Lahore filled with the
bodies of massacred Muslim men and children along with gunnysacks
filled with the severed breasts of Muslim women. After the news of
the massacre has spread, Lenny naively asks a close Muslim family
friend known as the Ice Candy Man (Aamir Khan) who lost his two
sisters in the massacre if their body parts were in one of the
sacks.
</P>
<P>
   But a child's perspective on such monumental events inevitably
cannot do them full justice. The movie's history and politics are
mostly laid out in conversations that the little girl overhears.
Even though the movie has scenes that don't include Lenny, the
people who loom large in her life lack the complexity of grown-up
characters examined from an adult point of view.
</P>
<P>
   As the story begins, the British have just announced the
partition of India into two countries (predominantly Hindu India
and predominantly Muslim Pakistan), and the members of the Sethna
household, which welcomes all sects, are worrying about the future.
During a dinner party, one of the guests, an imperious British
official, disdainfully predicts havoc and gets into a fight with a
Sikh (Sikhism combined elements of Hinduism and Islam) after
sneering at what he calls Sikh fanaticism. The quarrel offers just
a hint of the horrors to come.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny's world revolves around her nanny, Shanta (Nandita Das), a
beautiful young Hindu woman with several suitors. One is Dil Navaz,
the Ice Candy Man, who is a voice of reason and compassion in the
movie until the slaughter of his two sisters drives him mad with
vengeance. The man Shanta eventually chooses, Hasan (Rahul Khanna),
known as the Masseur, is a gentle, handsome Muslim who invents oils
made from pearl dust and fish eggs. So deep is his love of Shanta
(the two have an exquisite love scene) that he agrees to switch his
faith from Muslim to Hindu and take her to safety in India.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny remains unaware of the gathering storm until the streets
of Lahore swarm with rioters and arsonists stoking fires with
gasoline. As the violence escalates and the news of atrocities
enflames everyone, the neutrality of the Sethna household and
Shanta's safety become increasingly imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earth'' is a powerful and disturbing reminder of how a
civilization can suddenly crack under certain pressures. We have
only to look at the Balkans and Northern Ireland to find the same
cycle of violence being re-enacted. During the period of India's
partition, nearly 12 million Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs migrated
across the newly established borders and more than one million died
or were maimed in the interethnic violence. The aftershocks resound
to this day.

 &HT;    YOU'VE GOT MAIL -- COMING SOON FROM UNCLE SAM

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Starting next month, the Social Security
Administration will begin the largest personalized mailing ever
performed by a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   More than 125 million Americans will receive their first annual
Social Security statement from the federal government. The agency
plans to send 500,000 statements a day to workers age 25 and over
covered by Social Security who do not receive benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The statements will include how much an individual can expect to
receive for retirement, disability and survivor's benefits based on
current salary, plus the recipient's total earnings as recorded by
the agency. Workers can expect the four-page letter three months
before their next birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Social Security statement is a valuable tool that will
help Americans prepare for their long-term financial security,''
said Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel.
</P>
<P>
   A federal law enacted in 1990 requires the government to provide
annual Social Security statements to Americans by the year 2000.
The agency has experimented with mailing systems since 1995, when
it sent statements to people 60 and over. Gradually, the agency
began sending the letters to younger citizens, but never made it an
annual service.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the mailings, Americans were able to request their
statements from the Social Security Administration. During the past
12 years, the agency has responded to nearly 37 million requests.
Workers will still be allowed to request their statements after the
annual mailings begin by calling 1-800-772-1213.
</P>
<P>
   Workers who disagree with the information provided in their
statements may challenge them by also calling that number.
</P>
<P>
   The mailing will cost $70 million during the next year, or 56
cents per statement. The agency plans to make the mass mailings
part of its daily work load over the next year and will not need to
hire additional staff, said John Trollinger, Social Security's
deputy press officer.

`THE MINUS MAN': A KILLER COMES TO TOWN WITH POISON IN THE PICKUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine an overgrown John Boy Walton as a homicidal maniac and
you'll begin to get a picture of Vann Siegert (Owen Wilson), the
blond, affable drifter who is the central character in Hampton
Fancher's quietly creepy film, ``The Minus Man.'' This small, moody
portrait of a serial killer as the boy next door follows Vann in
his blue pickup truck to an unidentified Pacific Coast town where
he interacts with several unhappy souls who find in his blank,
pleasant face and good manners a vision of their own lost
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is narrated by Vann, who confides his thoughts in an
affectless drawl to a tiny portable tape recorder. ``You don't
always choose what you do,'' he observes early in the film.
``Sometimes what you do chooses you.'' Given his homicidal bent,
these and other philosophical asides assume a chilling undertone.
Every so often, Vann has fantasies (that may be flash-forwards) to
his brutal interrogation by a pair of detectives (Dwight Yoakam and
Dennis Haysbert) who have been tracking him down.
</P>
<P>
   In the film's opening scene, Vann pauses in his travels to stop
at a nearly deserted bar where he meets Casper (the film debut of
the rock singer Sheryl Crow), a bitter, shiftless alcoholic and
heroin addict whom he takes for a lethal ride in his truck. As
murderers go, Vann is as gentle as they come, giving his victims
swigs from a bottle of amaretto laced with an esoteric poison that
looks like light brown sugar and kills quickly with no hideous
spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Vann eventually rents a room in the home of an unhappily married
middle-aged couple, Doug (Brian Cox) and Jane (Mercedes Ruehl),
whose college-age daughter has fled the coop, leaving them at loose
ends and in a state of numb despair. Doug, who works at the local
post office, latches on to Vann as a surrogate son, taking him to
high school football games and helping him get a job sorting mail
in the local post office.
</P>
<P>
   As tortured in his own way as Vann, Doug gets into physical
fights with himself during which he gives himself a black eye. At
the post office, Vann also meets Ferrin (Janeane Garofalo), a shy,
lonely, hard-drinking young woman who fancies him as a boyfriend.
An awkward romance develops until their first serious embrace when
Vann's repressed psychopathic rage spontaneously asserts itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Minus Man,'' adapted from a novel by Lew McCreary, takes
such pains to avoid narrative and verbal cliches and anything that
could remotely be construed as sentimental or romantic that it
feels curiously flat. This is partly because so much of the movie
emanates from inside Vann's mind, which most of the time is devoid
of accessible emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite strong, idiosyncratic performances by everyone in the
cast and an evocatively eerie score by Marco Beltrami, the movie is
too stripped of feeling (beyond a lurking sense of imminent doom)
to be terribly engaging. Vann's landlords and co-workers are so
uniformly morose that the world he visits feels like an anteroom of
``The Twilight Zone'' in which the dominant mood could be described
as hushed American Gothic. Everyone seems to be going through the
motions of life while waiting for the end.

`B. MONKEY': A GLAMOUR PUSS WHO STEALS HEARTS AND ROBS BANKS

   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)

<P>
   The best part of ``B. Monkey'' is reveling in the dark side of
Rupert Everett. The dissolute Rupert Everett. Rupert Everett,
drinking and drugging, destroying his chiseled good looks and
recklessly putting his life in danger, as Paul, a bisexual London
criminal of some sort who owes money to some not very nice people.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers probably did not intend this emphasis. The
director, Michael Radford, who also did ``Il Postino,'' and the
writers, Michael Thomas and Chloe King, probably expected the title
character to be the focus. That would be Beatrice, played by Asia
Argento, a decadent young woman who makes her living as an armed
robber and lives in a murky but drop-dead glamorous apartment with
her partners in crime: Bruno (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Paul.
</P>
<P>
   B. (as in Bea) Monkey is her street name. One day she suddenly
decides to wash the clown-wig-red dye out of her hair. This is how
you know she's ready for a major life-style change. Which is where
the second-best part of ``B. Monkey'' comes in: Jared Harris, who
is becoming one of the most fascinating actors around. (Consider
his portrayal of Warhol in ``I Shot Andy Warhol'' and his turn as
an immoral Russian taxi driver in Todd Solondz's ``Happiness.'')
</P>
<P>
   In ``B. Monkey,'' Harris plays Alan, an elementary-school
teacher, the picture of safe, boring middle-classness, whose
after-hours job is as a disk jockey at a hospital radio station.
When Alan sees Bea in a bar, his safe, boring middle-class heart
skips a beat. Soon, after a few dates and a weekend in Paris
(during which we observe the aphrodisiacal powers of jazz), they're
living together on his shabby little houseboat, the picture of
crazed domesticity.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Beatrice _ her full name, which she pronounces
the Italian way (beh-ah-TREE-chay) _ can't seem to leave her past
completely behind. Bruno turns up, declaring his love, and moves in
with her and Alan. When the couple try to run away, trouble keeps
following them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course part of this is Beatrice's fault. If Alan admires a
car, she steals it for him. She has taken a straight job, but one
day she, Bruno and another accomplice rob a bank during her lunch
hour. (The fact that she still manages to bring a sandwich back for
her boss is, if nothing else, impressive time management.)
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Ms. Argento does anything wrong. She's gorgeous
and sexy, as Beatrice should be, but her character has been either
written or directed to be a little too aware of her charming
quirkiness. We're supposed to be as smitten with her as Alan, Paul
and Bruno are. If you're not, you won't much care what becomes of
her. &QL;

`LUCINDA'S SPELL': WILD TIME IN NEW ORLEANS, AND IT SURE ISN'T

<P>
   Let's say it's four days before the Eve of Beltane. (It's an
ancient Celtic holiday.) A mysterious visitor has just arrived in
New Orleans. He is Jason, also known as the First Horn, descendant
of Merlin, and he has these four days to choose the woman he will
impregnate to carry on his ``enchanted bloodline.'' Luckily, this
being New Orleans, an entire coven of witches has been eagerly
awaiting his arrival, each one hoping to be chosen for the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucinda's Spell,'' written and directed by Jon Jacobs, started
with that fairly enticing premise but turned it into a deliberately
vulgar, often offensive tale, suitable for insecure teen-age boys.
The witches' conversations are like some fantasy of Beavis and
Butt-head's about how women talk among themselves. At least Jacobs,
who also stars in the film as Jason, has some on-screen appeal _
somewhere between an aging rock star and a celebrity hairdresser _
but he's a little too much in love with himself to make Jason the
convincing, awe-inspiring supernatural hunk he should be.
</P>
<P>
   After the film's big demon-conjuring scene (in which one satyr
type gives new meaning to priapism), the question presents itself:
Why didn't Jacobs just go into actual pornography? It's not just
that the movie abounds in profanity, blunt sexual references and
nudity, both human and demonic; it's something about the way the
camera seems to leer at it all.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda (Christina Fulton) is a prostitute, or ``sex witch,''
who is looked down upon by the coven because of her profession. She
has a special reason to seek out Jason: they had a one-night stand
a few years ago and as a result she has a cute little blond boy
(Ajax Davis), who is now in an orphanage. If she can win the
contest _ yes, it's a contest, as in ``Who can cast the most
powerful spell?'' _ she will not only win Jason but also regain
custody of her son. Lucinda has a little trouble, though, because
the spell she's planning requires a dodo feather. ``I didn't know
dodos were extinct,'' she whines after looking all over town for
one. Oh, honey.

 &HT;    IT'S THE ENGLISH CITYFOLK VS TOWNFOLK IN BATTLE OF THE FOX
(HUNTING, THAT IS)
 &HT;    600&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The sight of English gentry atop well-bred mounts
behind a pack of baying hounds tearing after a mournful fox soon
will be consigned to landscape paintings if proposals to ban the
ancient sport are successful.
</P>
<P>
   When Parliament reconvenes next month, the fight over fox
hunting promises to be an ugly spectacle of modern Britain's deep
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   It pits country folks _ many of whom are weary of what they see
as meddling from London _ against citified ideas about animal
rights. It also involves subtle elements of class struggle spiced
with more than just a touch of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair fueled tensions in July when he
promised to keep his Labor Party's nearly forgotten pledge to end
fox hunting within two years. ``It will be banned as soon as we
possibly can,'' Blair said on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts interpreted Blair's stand as an attempt to
placate his party's left, which has been alienated by the prime
minister's turn to the center since he assumed power two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation, Blair's statement prompted a firestorm
of protests from pro-hunting groups. About 250 hunt supporters
staged an angry protest outside a Labor Party headquarters in
northern England. Some even lobbed eggs at a car carrying Blair on
a visit.
</P>
<P>
   A rally sponsored by the pro-hunt Countryside Alliance two years
ago drew 100,000 protesters to London and convinced the government
to shelve plans to end fox hunting here.
</P>
<P>
   Now, pro-hunt advocates threaten to demonstrate in force at the
Labor Party's annual conference later this month in the resort city
of Bournemouth.
</P>
<P>
   Their adversaries are no shrinking violets.
</P>
<P>
   British animal rights advocates are more vocal and politically
potent than their counterparts in the United States. They have
launched assaults on chimp testing centers, commando raids to
liberate minks and now are said to be planning sneak attacks on
amateur anglers.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the League Against Cruel Sports, the animal rights
activists disparage fox hunting as a barbaric bloodsport that has
no place in modern, enlightened society.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Britons are divided on the issue. About 215,000
people take part in about 350 hunts a year, more than half of which
involve foxes, officials say. Most of the rest have rabbits or deer
as the prey. While most foxes escape, the less fortunate ones are
mauled to death by specially trained hounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting advocates argue that foxes lack natural predators in
Britain, and are little more than pests who threaten farmers'
stocks. About 450,000 foxes are killed every year, but only about
16,000 are killed by foxhound packs. The rest are shot, gassed,
snared or trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-hunters also argue that ending the sport would kill 16,000
jobs, robbing $384 million from an already troubled rural economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hunting ban now would be taken as the final slap in the face
for rural communities already reeling from the biggest farming
crisis since the 1930s,'' said Richard Burge, the head of the
pro-hunting Countryside Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The other side dismisses the economic argument as wildly
exaggerated and abhors the notion that hunting with a pack of dogs
is an acceptable way to manage fox overpopulation.
</P>
<P>
   They also reject compromise proposals intended to license and
more strictly control hunts, insisting that only an outright ban
will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't actually think it's possible to hunt humanely,'' said
Howard Stoate, an anti-hunting leader in Parliament. ``In essence
it's a cruel sport.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's leading private landowner last week accused the
anti-hunting forces of indulging in class warfare while ignoring
the effect of existing laws that make unnecessary cruelty illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They persuade themselves to believe that such class warfare,
disguised as animal welfare, is perfectly justifiable regardless of
the enormous damage caused to rural communities,'' the Duke of
Buccleuch told a Scottish newspaper. ``As the law stands without
any need for amendment, there is absolutely nothing to stop any

 &HT;    IT'S THE ENGLISH CITYFOLK VS TOWNFOLK IN BATTLE OF THE FOX
(HUNTING, THAT IS)
 &HT;    600&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.

<P>
   LONDON _ The sight of English gentry atop well-bred mounts
behind a pack of baying hounds tearing after a mournful fox soon
will be consigned to landscape paintings if proposals to ban the
ancient sport are successful.
</P>
<P>
   When Parliament reconvenes next month, the fight over fox
hunting promises to be an ugly spectacle of modern Britain's deep
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   It pits country folks _ many of whom are weary of what they see
as meddling from London _ against citified ideas about animal
rights. It also involves subtle elements of class struggle spiced
with more than just a touch of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair fueled tensions in July when he
promised to keep his Labor Party's nearly forgotten pledge to end
fox hunting within two years. ``It will be banned as soon as we
possibly can,'' Blair said on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts interpreted Blair's stand as an attempt to
placate his party's left, which has been alienated by the prime
minister's turn to the center since he assumed power two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation, Blair's statement prompted a firestorm
of protests from pro-hunting groups. About 250 hunt supporters
staged an angry protest outside a Labor Party headquarters in
northern England. Some even lobbed eggs at a car carrying Blair on
a visit.
</P>
<P>
   A rally sponsored by the pro-hunt Countryside Alliance two years
ago drew 100,000 protesters to London and convinced the government
to shelve plans to end fox hunting here.
</P>
<P>
   Now, pro-hunt advocates threaten to demonstrate in force at the
Labor Party's annual conference later this month in the resort city
of Bournemouth.
</P>
<P>
   Their adversaries are no shrinking violets.
</P>
<P>
   British animal rights advocates are more vocal and politically
potent than their counterparts in the United States. They have
launched assaults on chimp testing centers, commando raids to
liberate minks and now are said to be planning sneak attacks on
amateur anglers.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the League Against Cruel Sports, the animal rights
activists disparage fox hunting as a barbaric bloodsport that has
no place in modern, enlightened society.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Britons are divided on the issue. About 215,000
people take part in about 350 hunts a year, more than half of which
involve foxes, officials say. Most of the rest have rabbits or deer
as the prey. While most foxes escape, the less fortunate ones are
mauled to death by specially trained hounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting advocates argue that foxes lack natural predators in
Britain, and are little more than pests who threaten farmers'
stocks. About 450,000 foxes are killed every year, but only about
16,000 are killed by foxhound packs. The rest are shot, gassed,
snared or trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-hunters also argue that ending the sport would kill 16,000
jobs, robbing $384 million from an already troubled rural economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hunting ban now would be taken as the final slap in the face
for rural communities already reeling from the biggest farming
crisis since the 1930s,'' said Richard Burge, the head of the
pro-hunting Countryside Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The other side dismisses the economic argument as wildly
exaggerated and abhors the notion that hunting with a pack of dogs
is an acceptable way to manage fox overpopulation.
</P>
<P>
   They also reject compromise proposals intended to license and
more strictly control hunts, insisting that only an outright ban
will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't actually think it's possible to hunt humanely,'' said
Howard Stoate, an anti-hunting leader in Parliament. ``In essence
it's a cruel sport.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's leading private landowner last week accused the
anti-hunting forces of indulging in class warfare while ignoring
the effect of existing laws that make unnecessary cruelty illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They persuade themselves to believe that such class warfare,
disguised as animal welfare, is perfectly justifiable regardless of
the enormous damage caused to rural communities,'' the Duke of
Buccleuch told a Scottish newspaper. ``As the law stands without
any need for amendment, there is absolutely nothing to stop any
guilty individual from being prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   The duke believes the hunt was a humane way to eradicate excess
foxes. ``Over the years I remember hounds putting a quick end to
foxes struggling in agony from gangrenous gunshot wounds and
three-legged foxes that had bitten off or torn off a leg to escape
from a snare,'' he said. ``With hounds, there can be no lingering
death. No one would claim that hunting is the most efficient method
of controlling the fox population, but if I was a fox, it is
certainly the way I would prefer.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cooper, chairman of the League Against Cruel Sports, was
appalled by the duke's comments.
</P>
<P>

groups,'' Cooper said. ``Many people in the countryside want
fox-hunting banned as well as those that live in the towns.
</P>

   ``Quite frankly I think that the duke is living in a different

the views of a Britain that is only a few months away from the

 &HT;    `` Finding the troubled woman behind tabloid princess
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 12.
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Emily Patrick painted Diana's likeness in 1986, the artist
recalls that the princess was uncomfortable with herself and was
hiding so much it was difficult to do a good portrait. The problem,
writes Sally Bedell Smith, was ``encountered by other artists as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to include Smith, who in researching the biography
describes the challenge of separating Diana's ``essential traits
from the mythic personality that had been assigned to her and then
to show how these traits guided her behavior and her
relationships.'' It proves difficult, indeed, to grasp the real
person among the images in a carnival hall of mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the competent biographer of William S. Paley and Pamela
Harriman, valiantly sifted through thousands of articles, several
dozen books, television shows, anonymous quotes and personal
interviews to ``find the woman behind the public mask.'' Blessedly,
the author has eschewed hagiography. Some Diana idolaters, in fact,
may find Smith too sympathetic to Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
   But she succeeds in her portrait _ up to a point. In detailing
Diana's childhood trauma of her parents' divorce, her habit of
lying, her destructive royal life, her bulimia and suicide
attempts, her search for salvation in men, the biographer makes a
convincing case that Diana was lost in a hopeless search for self.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's diagnosis that Diana probably suffered from
``borderline personality'' (a psychological disorder characterized
by ``unstable self-image; sharp mood swings; fear of rejection and
abandonment; an inability to sustain relationships; persistent
feelings of loneliness, boredom and emptiness; depression; and
impulsive behavior such as binge eating and self-mutilation''),
exacerbated by early parental loss, is spurious. One wonders how
anyone _ with or without identity problems _ would fare in the
British royal spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The questionable diagnosis is not the book's only drawback. In
her commendable quest to present reliable information, Smith's
portrait of Diana's life before Charles is tiresome, and she
inexplicably ignores the phenomenal public outpouring of affection
during Diana's funeral. Diana's iconography jelled in the days
after her death and created at least as much challenge for
biographers as did the living princess's multiple tabloid personas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Smith has done the best any responsible writer can _ she
has taken a fairy tale princess and rendered her as a believable
woman who, borderline personality or not, is somehow more likable
for her struggle against psychological troubles.

 &HT;    Latest work shows Stephen King is becoming more than just a
horror storyteller
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 12.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been 25 years since Stephen King published his first novel,
``Carrie,'' a book that was not even remotely a success until Brian
De Palma sent it screaming onto movie screens. During his first
quarter-century as an author, King has written about 47 books,
depending on how you number them (that's counting ``The Green
Mile,'' a novel serialized in six parts, as one book, for example).
</P>
<P>
   When people say of professional baseball players that they make
it look easy, it's the highest compliment; when said of King, it's
always been with a dismissive throat-clearing. King's prolificacy,
coupled with the genre he usually writes in _ horror _ has made him
easy to dismiss as an assembly-line author, a guy who is lousy with
prose, in both senses.
</P>
<P>
   But an appreciation for the diversity of King's gifts has been
growing. It seemed to start around ``The Green Mile'' (1996), with
its haunting characters _ and not in the usual oo-ee-oo haunting
way. The jointly published ``Desperation'' and ``The Regulators,''
also in 1996, were noted for the unusual way the two books stood
alone and yet were linked by crossover characters and themes. ``Bag
of Bones'' (1998), King's last doorstop book (the slender ``The
Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon'' followed), received the best serious
reviews of any King novel ever.
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying that King has evolved into a brilliant prose
stylist, although in terms of elegance, the difference between King
and John Updike is much less than the distance going the other way,
between, say, King and Tom Clancy or John Grisham.
</P>
<P>
   But King's growing stature hides a dirty little secret: The most
popular horror writer ever has outgrown horror. That statement will
surely horrify many of his fans, but it might just please the
author himself as he continues to recuperate from being hit and
seriously injured by a minivan in June.
</P>
<P>
   King's characters are so extensively rooted, his voice so
authentic and persuasive (whether first or third person), his
emotional depth so resonant, his narrative pacing so pitch-perfect,
that the spooky stuff now frequently seems to get in the way. Think
back to ``Bag of Bones'': Wasn't the best stuff by far the very
normal and heartbreaking love story that blossomed between the
narrator and the young single mother and her daughter, and wasn't
the ghost story rather overwrought by comparison?
</P>
<P>
   So it is with ``Hearts in Atlantis,'' King's latest, which is
most engaging when there isn't a boogeyman for miles, when a boy
and a girl in college make bittersweet love in a parked car with
the radio playing, knowing it's their last night together, or two
old friends meet unexpectedly after the funeral of a third.
</P>
<P>
   It is, really, a book about human hearts, tender and
complicated, and hearts, the card game, brutal and simple.
Atlantis, too, has a double meaning: a long forgotten silly song
from the late '60s by Donovan, and a utopia in the past that cannot
be recaptured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearts'' is not technically a novel, but five sections that
are linked yet distinct. The first, ``Low Men in Yellow Coats,'' a
novel in its own right, is set in 1960 and is the coming of age of
young Bobby Garfield, whose friendship with a mysterious elderly
man helps him deal with his mother, who veers between strict and
pathological. ``Low Men'' also has the most traditional King horror
elements, connected to his ``Dark Tower'' novels.
</P>
<P>
   Part 2 is a stand-alone novella, ``Hearts in Atlantis,'' about a
group of college freshmen at the University of Maine in 1966 who
hold all-night bouts of the card game hearts awash in profanity,
bravado and cigarette smoke. Outside their dorm, the Vietnam
protest movement is growing, though, and soon engulfs them. It's
here, in the emotional center of the book, that King reaches a
descriptive peak in evoking one slender but intensely real slice of
college life.
</P>
<P>
   (A surprising anachronism in the ``Hearts'' section has the
students talking about the TV series ``The Prisoner'' in 1966, even
though it didn't debut until 1968. King, normally meticulous about
his pop-culture references, acknowledges in an afterword that it's
deliberate but gives no reason.)
</P>
<P>
   Part 3 is a disquieting little short story, ``Blind Willie,''
about a Vietnam vet in 1983. Parts 4 and 5, set in the present, are
essentially chapters that round off the lives of some of the
characters.
</P>
<P>
   King and his publishers have made much of ``Hearts in Atlantis''
being King's big ``'60s novel,'' implying that it sums up the baby
boom generation. ``I began to see a way I might be able to write
about what we almost had, what we lost and what we finally ended up
with,'' King wrote in an afterword to the paperback edition of
``Bag of Bones,'' looking ahead to this book.
</P>
<P>
   Even though 75 percent of ``Hearts'' is set in the '60s, that is
not really what King has accomplished. The turmoil of those years
is notoriously difficult to capture in a fresh or meaningful way,
and when King has done so here, it's in the small details (a
college student drawing his first crude peace symbol on the back of
his high school letter jacket) rather than in a larger sense. As to
what ``we (boomers) finally ended up with,'' that is too diffuse to
grasp. About the only commonalities of boomers these days are a
preoccupation with our 401(k) plans and a lament for our lost
youth, neither of which King deals with, and thank goodness for
that.
</P>
<P>
   King has written well without the supernatural in the past (the
movies ``Stand by Me'' and ``The Shawshank Redemption'' were based
on his fine novellas). Maybe his accident will give him the excuse
he needs to change direction somewhat, branch out and write more
that is rooted in the real world. He's scared us plenty; the best
of his work, including the best parts of ``Hearts in Atlantis,''
shows he can move and enlighten us as well.

 &HT;    Gritty Warshawski back in action in search of justice
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 12.
 &HT;    ByCarolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  Hard Time by Sara Paretsky. Delacorte. $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   After a five-year absence, V.I. Warshawski, Chicago's toughest
female private detective, is back seeking justice on the city's
toughest streets. And, boy, was it worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   When Warshawski stops to help a dying hit-and-run victim, she is
made the prime suspect by a corrupted cop. The dead woman, it turns
out, was an escaped convict and former nanny to a prominent family.
Pretty soon, people involved in the case also turn up dead. Even
her friends, subject to threats, desert her.
</P>
<P>
   V.I., however, has a few supporters: an intrusive neighbor, her
trusty dogs, a Catholic priest, a loyal doctor, and an advocate for
the tortured in Latin America. The plot _ which roams from a
wealthy home in the suburbs to a brutal women's prison _ is
enormously complicated. But Paretsky's detail renders it nuanced
and believable.
</P>
<P>
   Her portrait of economic classes is as distinctly delineated as
Dickens', but without a drop of sentimentality. What makes V.I. so
endearing is her adherence to her blue-collar roots and her refusal
to sell out. And the plot intelligently raises issues about
torture, penal and legal systems, women's rights and the Internet.
This is Warshawski at her black-and-blue best, battling against
physical and financial hard knocks, hoping to make the world, or at
least her corner of Chicago, a more just place.

 &HT;    The trail and plot have grown cold for amateur sleuth Kinky
Friedman

   &QR;  Spanking Watson by Kinky Friedman. Simon &AMP; Schuster. $23.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be hard for the real Kinky Friedman, formerly of the
irreverent band the Texas Jewboys, to produce _ year after year _ a
humorous novel featuring New York City amateur sleuth Kinky
Friedman. The effort is beginning to show. Friedman's two books
since the clever ``Road Kill'' (in which Willie Nelson disappears)
have seemed flat _ almost half-hearted parodies of his earlier
work.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Spanking Watson,'' Kinky the detective is bored and spends
a lot of time plotting revenge on his upstairs neighbor, Winnie
Katz, whose lesbian dance class is raining plaster onto his head
and into his Don Imus mug. He hires all the Village Irregulars as
his Watsons. The action picks up halfway through, but the humor _
except for an intermittent one-liner and a chapter on Jewish
troublemakers in history _ often seems silly. Before the next
episode, someone needs to kick the Kinkster in the keister and get
him out of his room _ and his ennui _ and back to Texas.

 &HT;    As Jews celebrate Rosh Hashana today, they'll usher in a new
year _ not 2000 but 5760
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Saturday, Sept. 11.
 &HT;    By Gayle White

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Millennium? What millennium?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody keeps asking us what are we doing for the new
millennium,'' says Philip Schlossberg. ``Our new millennium is 240
years away.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg is director of Hillel, the Jewish student center at
the University of Georgia. For Schlossberg and his charges, as for
other Jews around the world, today is New Year's Day or Rosh
Hashana, literally ``the head of the year.'' While non-Jews prepare
for Y2K, they're ushering in 5760.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish time theoretically begins with creation. Jews place great
emphasis on lineage, and on passing on the truths of their faith
from the patriarchs and matriarchs of the Torah to generations yet
to come. But keeping up with two methods of counting time is not
always easy.
</P>
<P>
   Like many observant Jews, Schlossberg keeps two calendars _ ``my
Hebrew calendar and my English calendar,'' he calls them. He writes
important dates from each onto the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it gets a little schizophrenic if you have the wrong
calendar,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Both solar and lunar, the Jewish calendar alternates between
months of 29 and 30 days, since it takes 29 1/2 days for the moon
to revolve around the Earth. But the lunar calendar has only 354
days _ not 365 as the solar calendar requires, since it takes 365
1/4 days for the Earth to travel around the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, in an attempt to synchronize solar and lunar cycles,
the Jewish calendar is constructed on a 19-year basis with 12 years
of 12 months each and seven _ the third, sixth, eighth, 11th, 14th,
17th and 19th _ with an extra month.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of the extra month ensures that holidays stay
within the same season on the Gregorian or solar calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Rosh Hashana falls on the first day of the month of Tishri in
the Jewish calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought the Jewish calendar is an astonishingly
strong moral manifestation of the search for truth in the Jewish
tradition,'' says Michael Broyde, a law professor and academic
director of the law and religion program at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian calendar we live with is constant with the solar
year, but the months are arbitrary units simply dividing the world
into conventional periods,'' Broyde says. ``You could just as well
have 10 months alternating between 36 and 37 days. The Islamic
calendar is a purely lunar calendar and loses 11 days a year,
falling constantly behind the solar calendar. The Jewish calendar
is the only calendar I'm aware of that's consistent with both the
lunar months and the solar year, two truths of the natural
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world dominated by another calendar, however, ``it's
painfully difficult to live one's life in two distinctly different
universes,'' says Broyde, who is also rabbi of Young Israel of Toco
Hills, an Orthodox synagogue. ``Juggling it requires continuously
walking around with a calendar that lists both.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Jewish holidays fall on different dates of the
Gregorian calendar, ``every year Jews will say, `Gee, the holidays
are coming early this year,''' says Rabbi Steven Lebow. Or, ``Gee,
the holidays are late this year.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, he says, they're early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some years Rosh Hashana doesn't occur until about Oct. 1. Then
it seems like the holidays go on forever and ever,'' says Lebow,
senior rabbi of Temple Kol Emeth, a Reform synagogue in Cobb
County.
</P>
<P>
   For Jews, the new year begins a 10-day period of
self-examination known as the Days of Awe, culminating with Yom
Kippur, the Day of Atonement.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jewish tradition, Rosh Hashana marks the
anniversary of the creation of the world and the day on which God
opens the Book of Life to record one's deeds. On Yom Kippur,
considered the holiest day of the year for Jews, God once again
closes the book.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-seven sixty is ``just another year in the Jewish calendar
with no sensationalism attached,'' said Jan Epstein, hostess of
``Tikun Olam,'' translated ``Repair the World,'' a show on Atlanta
Interfaith Broadcasters cable television station.
</P>
<P>
   But since the rest of the world is looking forward to a new
century and a year with three zeros, Epstein says, she is more
committed than ever to emphasize the good news in the community
through her show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been so rocky the last six months of this century,
I want the good people to override the negative,'' she says.
``There are a lot of people who really work hard to make this a
better world.''

 &HT;    The doyenne of objectivism joins academy
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 12.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No fewer than a dozen Playboy centerfold models have declared
her novels their favorite books.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, was once a
groupie, as was Clark Gable.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Ephron, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Camille Paglia and the
Canadian rock band Rush _ all have been disciples to one degree or
another.
</P>
<P>
   Writers like to think they know their readers, but you have to
say this is quite a mixed bag _ and it's anyone's guess which of
them could give you a working definition of objectivism.
</P>
<P>
   When Ayn Rand died in 1982, the ideas that made her a
countercultural goddess to generations of college students and
armchair intellectuals had filtered into popular thought, where
their provenance was not always apparent or acknowledged. The
effluent had become the mainstream, something never before seen in
the history of hydraulics. When you hear educators talk about
``self-esteem,'' you're hearing the echo of Ayn Rand. When you hear
Neal Boortz yammering on about ``logic'' and ``thought process,''
you're getting a pure draft of the robust egotism that Rand
espoused in ``The Fountainhead'' and ``Atlas Shrugged.''
</P>
<P>
   They are novels as fat as ``War and Peace,'' and they still sell
100,000 copies a year. In the 1950s and '60s, young people devoured
them on the side, out of sneering professors' view. For the young,
``The Fountainhead'' and ``Atlas Shrugged'' had a veneer of
profundity, and the sex scenes were ahead of their time, even if
they were rendered with all the subtlety of someone doing a roofing
job.
</P>
<P>
   The progress of Randian scholarship
</P>
<P>
   Ayn Rand (the first name is pronounced ``Ein,'' not ``Ann'') may
have been an outsider among intellectuals and academics of the
1950s and '60s, but she was all the more popular for that very
reason. And by the 1970s, clubs committed to her ideas and think
tanks of co-religionists had spread across the country.
</P>
<P>
   People who call themselves libertarian owe a debt to Ayn Rand,
like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Now, alas, she's becoming an insider within the academy, an
institution she deeply loathed. Earlier this year, a collection of
feminist papers _ some sympathetic, others not _ appeared in a
university press series that also included titles by Plato, Hegel
and Hannah Arendt.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of Lingua franca magazine, Scott McLemee
traces Rand's lineage, and a strange story it is: A compound of
kinky sex and, well, kinky psychology and politics, too. The
progress of Randian scholarship, as McLemee writes, ``has by no
means been a straight line of ascent. The Old Guard who knew Rand
looks with unconcealed horror at the new scholarship exploring the
genesis and structure of objectivist theory. Nor would the grande
dame herself have been pleased by all the academic attention.''
</P>
<P>
   No control over membership
</P>
<P>
   She seems a cold fish, and yet she cast a certain spell. McLemee
captures the image nicely:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ayn Rand possessed not just an interpretation of the world but
the charisma of a visionary _ someone for whom even the most
abstract ideas were visceral realities. She had complex eyes. They
look black, yet her gaze is invariably likened to a laser beam. The
trace of a Russian accent was not subtle, but the most evident
thing about her voice was its precision, born of an absolute
seriousness that precluded any sense of humor. Young admirers
gathered in Rand's salon, where they emulated her use of the
cigarette holder and the categorical denunciation. No other figure
in American literature so closely resembles a Dostoyevsky
character.''
</P>
<P>
   That interpretation of the world was intoxicatingly simple: Some
people are achievers and others aren't, and the weak live off the
strong. She applied it to history, philosophy, art and sex, and the
circle of self-conscious individualists who sat at her feet
(calling themselves, with intended irony, the Collective) were
eager apostles. None were more devoted than Nathaniel and Barbara
Brandon, a young couple who had read ``The Fountainhead'' dozens of
times. Nathaniel Brandon (whose 1969 book ``The Psychology of
Self-Esteem'' would become the unacknowledged source of much of the
self-gratification of the '70s and the self-esteem dogma of the
'90s) became not only Rand's protege but also her lover.
</P>
<P>
   He was 25 years younger than Rand, and all the logic objectivism
could muster was brought to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their affair was kept secret from the Collective,'' McLemee
writes, ``but not from their spouses, who were expected to realize
that the passion of Ayn and Nathaniel was rational and undeniable,
like that of Rand's heroes and heroines. Barbara went along glumly.
Frank was also compliant and went to a nearby bar to begin drinking
himself into decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon, as McLemee says, was the Anointed One _ and then, in
1968, ``it all imploded.'' Brandon had fallen in love with another
objectivist student, and the difference in years between himself
and Rand was no longer something he could rationalize. Rand was
devastated. The movement was disillusioned. Brandon set out on his
own.
</P>
<P>
   But the ideas, many callow, others commonplace fancied up to
sound like philosophy, were in the public domain. The madame could
no longer control membership of her own salon. It would have been
the greatest indignity, after the betrayal by a man whose head
found the reasons his heart needed.

BROWNS' COUCH NO BABE IN ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects name of Couch's high school to Leslie.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Driving to and from work at Leslie County High
School in Hyden, Ky. _ early in the morning or late at night,
spring through winter; it made no difference _ Tim Koogler would
pass the two-story house and see the little boy out there on the
front lawn. The junior varsity head coach and varsity assistant
began to take the sight for granted, as if the kid were part of the
shrubbery.
</P>
<P>
   He was always on the 75-foot expanse of grass, it seemed, always
throwing a football. Often he'd be playing catch with his big
brother, but a human target wasn't a necessity. Illuminated in the
darkness by the lights his father had installed, he'd be out there
alone, improvising until bedtime, drilling passes to the utility
pole 30 yards away near the roadway that served as his makeshift
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing changed about the scene over the years, Koogler
noticed. Like the shrubs, the kid kept growing, and so did his
proficiency and his reputation and eventually his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   All of them, in fact, have reached unimaginable proportions for
Tim Couch _ former high school legend, recent college
program-saver, and current National Football League poster boy as
the top pick in the 1999 draft.
</P>
<P>
   In their latest incarnation, the expansion Cleveland Browns
decided to build their second coming around Couch, choosing the
6-foot-5-inch, 225-pound junior quarterback from the University of
Kentucky with the No. 1 selection in April and investing in him a
$12.5 million signing bonus and a seven-year contract that could
top out at $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   They've made him rich, but not the starter. When the Browns open
the season against the Pittsburgh Steelers Sept. 12, Couch will be
the understudy to journeyman Ty Detmer. Unlike previously anointed
No. 1 saviors such as John Elway and Peyton Manning, who were
thrown immediately into the fire and the fanfare, Couch will be
nurtured slowly, cultivated like one of those shrubs in his front
yard. That's been the plan right along, emphasizes coach Chris
Palmer, the former Boston University boss and Patriots assistant
who has tutored, among others, Pro Bowlers Drew Bledsoe and Mark
Brunell. The Browns experienced no dissatisfaction when they
unwrapped their prize package. Quite the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's developed very, very nicely,'' says Palmer. ``He's done
everything we've asked. And he's used to the pressure. He carried
Kentucky. He turned around Kentucky's program and now he has a
chance to turn ours around.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually. And that makes sense to Couch, an unassuming sort
who with a few blond curls could pass for Larry Bird's twin and
whose college quarterback coach, Chris Masters, calls him ``just a
big ol' country boy from the hills of Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a rookie quarterback,'' says Couch. ``It's going to take
time. I've got a long way to go. I feel really comfortable. It's
just a matter of getting repetitions. I know what I'm doing in
practice. I've just got to learn the reads during games. I think
I'm capable of playing really well. It's just a matter of
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence was really mixed in the exhibition season, he
learned. Couch was superb in two relief appearances, rallying the
Browns to victory in their Hall of Fame Game opener, a 20-17
decision over the Cowboys (11 for 17, 137 yards, 1 touchdown), and
against the Bears in a 35-24 shootout (10 for 14, 128 yards, 1 TD).
But like the rest of the team, he was a dud in a 30-3 debacle at
Tampa (5 for 12, 27 yards). He was decidedly indifferent in his
lone start, a 24-17 loss to the Vikings that christened Cleveland
Browns Stadium (8 for 17, 77 yards). And in Thursday's finale, a
30-17 loss to the Eagles, Couch (5 for 9, 41 yards) was outplayed
by fellow first-round pick Donovan McNabb of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Disregarding the numbers, he made an immediate impression on his
teammates, especially one with a rather lofty frame of reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first chance he got to play,'' recalls Dave Wohlabaugh,
Bledsoe's center with the Patriots before joining Cleveland, ``he
seemed really poised. I was shocked. He wasn't stuttering or
anything in the huddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because Couch has been preparing for this moment
almost since the cradle. Growing up in Hyden, a hamlet of 350 in
Kentucky's southeastern hills that once was a coal mining center
but whose principal employer now is the Board of Education, he
realized that his recreational opportunities were limited, if not
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go through town right now,'' says Onzie Feltner, who
began coaching Couch in the second grade at Hyden Elementary
School, ``there's probably a bunch of kids sitting in the parking
lot talking and watching the traffic go by.''
</P>
<P>
   For more interesting diversions, you'd have to drive to Perry
County, 20 miles away, to take in a movie or pump quarters into an
arcade. Or you could opt for the type of home entertainment Couch
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really have anything to do except throw a ball,'' he
says. ``There was nothing else to occupy my time. I've always seen
myself as an NFL quarterback. I've wanted to be one ever since I
can remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what he first wanted to be was just like his brother.
Four and a half years older, Greg was Tim's idol and throwing
partner from the beginning. And since Greg was a quarterback, Tim
became one, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we played football,'' recalls Greg, who now helps
manage his brother's career, ``we'd be on opposite teams so we
could both be quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim was Greg's rival in pickup games but his successor in
organized football. ``He was always one team behind me,'' says
Greg. ``He'd take over when I left.''
</P>
<P>
   That pattern began under Feltner. Tim would tag along with Greg
to practice and play along the sidelines with a bunch of other
little brothers. When his time came to don the uniform, Feltner
utilized Tim at every backfield position so he could familiarize
himself with each assignment. But there was no doubt about his
permanent position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had a strong arm,'' says Feltner. ``It seemed like
even at the start, he'd throw with his whole body; a lot of people
just throw with their arm. I guess you could call him a
tailback-quarterback. If we had to pass the ball, the quarterback
would lateral to him and he'd throw on a rollout or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   By sixth grade, you could call Tim strictly a
quarterback-quarterback, and he's been there ever since. Even then,
he seemed to be aiming toward the horizon. ``You could always tell
he had something in mind down the road,'' says Feltner.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he took over the huddle for Koogler's JVs, ``real
uncommon for a seventh- or eighth-grader,'' says the coach. But
there was no mistaking he belonged. Koogler once saw a Couch pass
leave a gouge the length of his receiver's hand between the two
middle fingers. For laughs, he'd stand at the 50-yard line and bet
Koogler a Gatorade that he could hit the goalpost with a pass.
Couch never went thirsty.
</P>
<P>
   And Leslie County High feasted. During Couch's tenure, the
stadium swelled with 7,000 fans _ 20 times the town's population _
on football Fridays as he led the team to the state semifinals as a
junior and senior. Along the way, he set national high school
records for TD passes, yardage, completions, and completion
percentage, in the process setting off a recruiting hysteria. But
he created doubts about his sanity by turning down Florida State
and Tennessee and Penn State to attend Kentucky, which was riding
the momentum of a typical 1-10 season. ``It was loyalty or
something, I guess,'' says Koogler, now the head high school coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my home state school,'' explains Couch. ``I grew up
wanting to play there. I watched them as a kid. It seemed like the
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not during his freshman year, when he struggled in coach Bill
Curry's option offense, which was catastrophically ill-suited to
Couch's talents. But he flourished after Hal Mumme took over the
Wildcats in his sophomore season and brought in Masters as
quarterback tutor.
</P>
<P>
   Masters arrived from Central Florida, where he'd worked with a
kid by the name of Daunte Culpepper, Minnesota's top draft choice
last spring. ``Culpepper can throw the ball a little farther,''
says Masters. ``But Couch can throw more types of passes. And he
throws the most catchable ball I've ever seen. He's the Greg Maddux
of football. People don't understand: Why throw your fastball if
you can win with your changeup?''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats' fortunes changed up in the next two years, capped
by last season's 7-5 record that culminated in an Outback Bowl
berth. Operating Mumme's and Masters's West Coast offense, Couch
became a sizzling commodity, setting seven NCAA records, earning
All-America honors, finishing as a Heisman Trophy finalist _ and
emerging as a prime candidate to go No. 1 in the draft if he chose
to leave school early.
</P>
<P>
   His dedication never was in doubt. A four-month season still
wasn't enough. During the winter, Tim would call Greg, who was
finishing up his quarterbacking career at Eastern Kentucky, and
have his brother bring some teammates 20 minutes down the road to
Lexington for a little seven-on-seven session with the Wildcats.
``He's going to play football until he can't walk,'' says Masters.
``That's how much he loves the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The one reservation about Couch concerned arm strength, and
Masters considers that a misconception because Kentucky's scheme
emphasized throwing underneath the coverage. ``A lot of guys can
throw 80 or 90 yards,'' says Masters. ``But not many can throw the
`out' route? Our old offensive coordinator, Mike Leach, said it
best: `I got eight or nine linemen who can throw the ball farther
than Couch. Would you want to draft them No. 1?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns eventually provided the answer, though they wanted to
make sure before committing the reborn franchise's cornerstone
pick. ``The first workout he had for us,'' says Cleveland
quarterback coach John Hufnagel, ``he had good arm strength, but
there were still some questions. The second workout, he'd answered
all the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's just one left: Can Couch dominate at this level as
he has since grammar school? Make that two: Is he jaded by the
whole process after all these years?
</P>
<P>
   ``It never grows old,'' he says, eyes sparkling. ``You always
set the challenge to get to the top after starting at the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal history says he'll do it. Just ask that utility pole.

`BEST LAID PLANS': NOIRISH, STYLISH AND A WAR OF NERVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two old friends, Nick (Alessandro Nivola) and Bryce (Josh
Brolin), are in a bar when a highly available-looking single woman
named Kathy (Reese Witherspoon) catches their eye. Fade out,
mysteriously, on the back of her head. Then it is hours later and
Bryce is frantically summoning Nick to the house where he and the
woman have had a sexual encounter that went very wrong. As proof of
that, she is now gagged and handcuffed to the base of a pool table.
She's upset. But maybe Nick is more so. Kathy was Lissa, Nick's
devoted girlfriend, before this whole thing got started.
</P>
<P>
   These are the seeds of the junior noir thriller ``Best Laid
Plans,'' a mixed bag of striking visual style and overbearingly
poisonous plotting that perhaps not even the actors could entirely
believe. Nivola, who was so good as John Travolta's malevolent
brother in ``Face/Off'' and is a handsome, coolly compelling
presence here, has said: ``We were all pretty easygoing about it.
You'd come to work, do the job, act like somebody else, then go
home and go about your life. You never felt that one person was off
somewhere exploring the recesses of their darker side.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be unfair to cite that if this film by Mike Barker (a
former BBC cameraman who directed one previous feature, ``The James
Gang''), which aspires to the chilly perfectionism and moral
ambiguity of ``The Usual Suspects'' or ``Red Rock West,'' were not
so clearly at war with itself. Visually ambitious but
exasperatingly written (by Ted Griffin, also responsible for the
solemn absurdities of ``Ravenous''), it's the kind of thriller in
which style overwhelms substance by default. In a scene in which a
character is suddenly abducted, for instance, there's as much
emphasis on the neon-colored lighting behind the car's hood
ornament as on the drama of the event. When the contents of the
heroine's purse are dumped out and searched, the camera's is right
there on the floor, looking up through a glass-topped coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   The story, which attempts a three-character war of nerves in the
form of an elaborate scam, can't easily compete with such
interesting distractions. But it means to manipulate the
characters' scruples and the viewer's suspicions. Flashing back
four months earlier, it establishes Lissa as a worldly but trusting
soul who is charmed by Nick as soon as she meets him. Nick, on the
other hand, is the sort of guy who's in a good mood right after his
father's wake. And Bryce, played with gutsy obnoxiousness by
Brolin, is a whiner from a wealthy family, the very embodiment of
values gone wrong. It seems no accident that the place where Bryce
is house-sitting, wittily done to death by the production designer
Sophie Becher, has purple carpet creeping up the bathroom walls.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the ante is raised as the characters have to make
more and more damning decisions about one another. The actors do
this earnestly (Ms. Witherspoon is touchingly anguished, Novola
charismatic), but too often the film seems to be playing ethical
dress-up with film noir crises it can't fully embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best Laid Plans'' clings to this genre plotting while also
trying to maintain a fashionable remoteness, to the point where
when an angry drug dealer punishes a thief, the sequence looks like
a sadist's dream of a fashion shoot. The setting is minimalist, the
victim seen behind a sheer white screen and the tormentor (Rocky
Carroll, playing this small role with brio) discusses economics in
terms of ``The Wealth of Nations.'' What's wrong with this picture?

 &HT;    DANFORTH TO FOCUS ON 'DARK QUESTIONS' OF WACO CASE
 &HT;    740&AMP;add. With WACO-PROBE.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening an independent investigation of the 1993
FBI assault on a religious compound in Texas, former Sen. John
Danforth promised Thursday to answer the ``dark questions'' of the
Waco incident: ``Did the government kill people?'' and ``Was there
a cover-up?''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said core values of American democracy are at stake in
his inquiry into the deaths of 76 Branch Davidians and whether
federal officials lied and hid evidence after fire consumed the
sect's fortified home outside Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``If government covers things up, if government kills people, if
that's what happened _ and I don't prejudge that _ then that
undermines what (Thomas) Jefferson talked about as being the very
foundation of government,'' explained Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a big thing,'' said Danforth. ``I think that it
is very important to try to get answers to questions that are
important for the whole integrity of our government.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno announced Danforth's appointment as
the fulfillment of her pledge for an outside probe to finally ``get
to the bottom'' of the Waco controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Repubicans have been calling for Reno to resign
since the FBI belatedly disclosed that it had used military-issue
tear gas canisters on April 19, 1993, as the agency ended its
51-day seige of the Branch Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and other federal officials had denied for six years that
the devices, which use heat to disperse the tear gas, were used at
Waco. They still maintain that the Davidians, not the FBI, started
the deadly fires.
</P>
<P>
   Saying ``I don't run from controversy,'' Reno said Thursday she
would stay on the job. However, she said her duties will no longer
include matters relating to Waco because ``I will obviously be a
witness'' in Danforth's probe.
</P>
<P>
   With Reno recused, Danforth will deal with Deputy Attorney
General Eric Holder.
</P>
<P>
   The probe will focus on ``bad acts'' rather than ``bad
judgment,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country can survive bad judgment,'' he explained. ``But
the thing that really undermines the integrity of government is
whether there were bad acts, whether there was a cover-up, and
whether ... the government killed people.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said his investigation will answer those ``dark
questions,'' not second-guess ``judgment calls'' about the federal
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department orders that name Danforth a special
counsel authorize him to investigate specific areas:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether any government agents or officials lied or withheld,
altered or destroyed evidence about what went on at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether any government agents used incendiary devices or
engaged in gunfire at the Branch Davidian compound on April 19,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether government agents started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether there was any illegal use of U.S. military forces in
connection with the operation by federal law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The orders also call for ``public dissemination'' of the
findings ``to the maximum extent possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope and my intention that the facts that are
discovered will be made available to the American people, for that
is very, very important,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the special counsel is enpowered to convene a grand
jury and take testimony in private, if need be.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth also said in a televised interview Thursday that he
would have the power to prosecute individuals for criminal
wrongdoing if that became necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he does not know how long the investigation will
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it would be a mistake to set a fixed time
limit,'' he said. ``I can tell you that my goals are first of all
to be absolutely objective, and I go into this with no preconceived
ideas whatever. So I'm going to be totally, totally objective. I'm
going to call 'em as I see 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he will enlist investigators and attorneys from
outside government to conduct at least most of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that the FBI should be investigating the
FBI,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh issued a statement saying, ``I welcome
the attorney general's selection of Senator Danforth.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said his chief deputy will be U.S. Attorney Edward Dowd
of St. Louis, ``a person who is very highly regarded in our
community, a very respected prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowd will leave his federal position and join Danforth's law
firm. A Democrat, Dowd was backed for his Justice Department
position by Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Waco investigation will be headquartered in St. Louis, where
both Danforth and Dowd reside.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders of several congressional committees have
declared their intent to hold hearings on the Waco incident and
will likely be calling the same witnesses that Danforth will be
interrogating.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this would interfere with his probe, Danforth said,
``I'm not going to try to tell Congress what to do, or what not to
do, or what I think they should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the appointment, Reno said she had found the right
person for a tough job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to find someone with impeccable credentials,
someone with bipartisan support in Washington who is widely
regarded throughout the country, someone who is independent and
someone who has the wisdom and determination to do the job the
right way,'' she said. ``I have found that person in Senator John
Danforth.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, a three-term Republican senator from Missouri, also
served as that state's attorney general and is an ordained
Episcopal minister.

`STIGMATA': CLERICS AND THE POSSESSED (HOLD THE SPINNING HEADS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just in time for Armageddon, Y2K, or the cataclysm of your
choice comes ''Stigmata,'' a silly, roiling melange of special
effects and overheated religious symbolism that at first seems to
be about the Second Coming but turns out to be a half-baked
anticlerical screed involving Vatican politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although the trailer for the movie presents ``Stigmata'' as a
kind of ``Son of the Exorcist,'' its glimpses of hell have none of
the force or ingenuity of its deeply scary forerunner. Instead of
spewed pea soup, spinning heads and the harsh voices of the
possessed growling obscenities, ``Stigmata'' gives us lots of
broken glass, bird feathers, dripping blood and desperately fancy
camera angles.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of this supernatural maelstrom is Frankie Paige
(Patricia Arquette), an airhead beautician in Pittsburgh whose
troubles begin when she opens a package sent by her mother from
Brazil. Out tumbles a rosary that Mom bought from a street peddler
in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, neither Frankie nor her mother is aware that the gift was
lifted from the dead body of a saintly priest in a small Brazilian
town where a statue of the Virgin Mary has been weeping tears of
blood beside his open coffin.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Frankie is taking a bath when she inspects the
package. As she fingers her gift, the candles around the tub begin
to flicker and a frantically flustered dove materializes out of
nowhere. Moments after she submerges herself in the water, chaos
descends.
</P>
<P>
   Amid screams, swirling camera movements and multiple exposures,
we see nails driven into Frankie's wrists and the bath water
turning crimson. The next thing, she is in the hospital where she
is initially diagnosed as suicidal and later as epileptic.
</P>
<P>
   News of her seizure reaches the Vatican where Father Kiernan
(Gabriel Byrne), its special investigator into such phenomena, is
immediately dispatched to Pittsburgh to look into the case. In an
absurd coincidence, Kiernan has just returned from the Brazilian
church with the weeping statue. But his scowling boss, Cardinal
Houseman (Jonathan Pryce) refuses to take his account seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The movie bumblingly connects these events to the discovery and
suppression of a new biblical text, written in Aramaic, possibly in
Jesus' own words. Since those words include statements that might
undermine the authority of the Roman Catholic Church, the cardinal,
loyal Vatican cleric that he is, is hell-bent to make sure that
they are never published.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stigmata,'' directed by Rupert Wainwright, is little more than
a series of frenzied music-video-style eruptions (Frankie has
seizures in a subway car, in a flower market and on the street in
front of her apartment) crudely stitched together with the plodding
scenes of Kiernan's investigation. Naturally, an attraction
develops between the investigator and Frankie who is not religious.
When in full demonic possession, she becomes a temptress with an
overdubbed baritone.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arquette, an actress so expressively inert that she makes
Daryl Hannah and Melanie Griffith seem Shakespearean by comparison,
plays Frankie as a blankly sexy cipher. Her irritated reactions to
her dire situation have all the force of a pet owner's whiny
complaints when her feline refuses to use the cat box. Even in full
seizure, Ms. Arquette doesn't have to act. The camera goes into
spasms for her and takes control. &QL;

`STIR OF ECHOES': SUPERNATURAL FORCES ENTER AN ORDINARY MAN'S
LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ``Don't be afraid of it, Daddy,'' counsels wise little Jake
(Zachary David Cope), yet another boy who can see dead people, in
``Stir of Echoes.'' You don't have to be psychic to know how hot
movies about the occult will be in the wake of ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   With its soon to be way-too-relevant theme (the Baby Boom
generation peeks into the next world) and child star with three
names (uncannily good Haley Joel Osment), that film is sure to
uncork a bottleful of copycats, but it's awfully soon to find one
on screen. Fortunately, ``Stir of Echoes'' isn't entirely about
Jake's extrasensory aptitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as written and directed by David Koepp, it's about the
ordeal of Jake's father Tom (Kevin Bacon), who begins this story as
the last man on earth who might interest himself in unseen
phenomena. With a hard-hat job that negates his rock-star ambitions
and a potentially happy marriage (to Kathryn Erbe's pert Maggie)
that is mired in quotidian detail, Tom has more than enough to
grouse about on this earthly plane.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-sensers in the audience will detect the whiff of a
different, tougher movie about Tom and Maggie's lives, but ``Stir
of Echoes'' is instead interested in invoking the G-word: ghost.
</P>
<P>
   One night, Tom is bugged by Maggie's noisy New Age
sister-in-law, Lisa (played irrepressibly by Illeana Douglas) at a
party in his close-knit Chicago neighborhood. Tom has a baby
monitor handy to hear Jake from across the street, but it turns out
he will be tuning in a more exotic frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa baits Tom into letting her put him into a trance, and when
he wakes up, all he knows is that he felt no pain when a pin was
driven through his hand, and that everyone in the room is laughing
at him. Rarely has there been a more persuasive argument against
letting oneself be hypnotized by in-laws in a semi-public place.
</P>
<P>
   After the trance, which Koepp evokes in artful, scary ways from
the viewpoint of Tom's third eye, Tom finds himself truly spooked.
He has been left with some sort of post-hypnotic suggestion that
leaves his mind a lot more open than he'd like.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for instance, the baby sitter who arrives one night
and sets off a blood-red flash in his imagination. There's also the
long-haired female specter that seems to be living at Tom's house
and speaking with Jake on a much too cozy basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stir of Echoes'' watches as Tom obsessively embarks on a
mission to find out what the ghost is after. In a taut, grippingly
intense performance, Bacon captures the frenetic torment of a man
driven to extremes (like taking a jackhammer to the floor of his
house) by forces he can't begin to fathom. But however spookily and
expertly this tale begins, it manages to become increasingly
earthbound as it draws closer to the ghost, and not merely because
Tom has by then dug up most of the backyard and tracked it indoors.
</P>
<P>
   The film has begun losing track of its highly marketable
eeriness and begun using the dramatic vocabulary of a more
run-of-the-mill thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Koepp, the screenwriter with an array of big Hollywood movies
(``Jurassic Park,'' ``The Lost World,'' ``Mission: Impossible'') to
his credit as well as some interestingly offbeat ones (Curtis
Hanson's ``Bad Influence,'' Martin Donovan's ``Apartment Zero''),
has a flair for malaise, and not just the kind induced by rampaging
raptors.
</P>
<P>
   His previous feature, ``The Trigger Effect,'' used a citywide
blackout to undo the ties holding society together, and the best
parts of ``Stir of Echoes'' have the same effect. The film goes
from watching Tom fit in with family and neighbors, however
uneasily, to declaring that all bets are off. Both he and Ms.
Erbe's Maggie are more affecting when they find themselves
strangely alienated than when they wonder who's seen a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``The Sixth Sense,'' ``Stir of Echoes'' doesn't have an
ending that mandates a second viewing; there's no final-act secret
whammy in store. But it's another thriller that packs a spooky
wallop as it conjures an unseen world within reach. &QL;

`LOVE STINKS': WHEN HER GOAL IS MARRIAGE AND HIS SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seth should have known he was in trouble when he picked up
Chelsea for their first date and saw her coffee table strewn with
half a dozen brides' magazines. When he hired her as his decorator,
she turned his guest room into a nursery. Then she bought him a
puppy.
</P>
<P>
   The goal-oriented courtship of Seth (French Stewart) and Chelsea
(Bridgette Wilson) constitutes the plot of ``Love Stinks,'' a
one-dimensional comedy that mostly falls flat. It does have a few
real laughs, though, and a surprisingly satisfying final plot
twist.
</P>
<P>
   When Seth and Chelsea first meet, at the glamorous outdoor
Southern California wedding of their closest friends (Tyra Banks
and Bill Bellamy), they charm each other with punch lines like
Seth's assessment of his dancing abilities, ``I suffer from white
man's disease, which is the No. 1 killer of rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's confident-but-clueless persona works well in his role
as a space alien passing for human on the television comedy ``Third
Rock From the Sun,'' but it doesn't fit this supposedly L.A.-cool
character. As for Ms. Wilson, the film doesn't trust her to be
sexy, although she's young, blond, shapely and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case it isn't clear that Seth stays in the relationship
only because of what he describes as outstanding sex, the costume
designer puts Chelsea in revealing, largely unbuttoned tops that
make her look half-dressed even in this age of lingerie as
outerwear.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Chelsea tells her woman friend, ``Whatever it
takes, I'm going to marry that man,'' the plot charges ahead.
Developments include the disappearance of a cat Seth is allergic
to, the disappearance of a pair of $10,000 diamond earrings, the
appearance of an Elvis impersonator who conducts Las Vegas
weddings, the gleeful recording of a joint answering machine
message, use of handcuffs, flatulence jokes and a palimony suit,
not necessarily in that order.
</P>
<P>
   The film's humor sometimes deteriorates into exchanges like this
one from the obligatory ``saying `I love you' for the first time''
scene. She: ``So say it back.'' He: ``It back.'' There is an
attempted subplot about how the relationship affects the sitcom
that Seth produces, but it seems tacked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Stinks,'' written and directed by Jeff Franklin, may
actually be misogynist _ it certainly paints Chelsea and her female
friends as grossly manipulative _ but it's hard to get worked up
about it. Whether the film is meant as an attack on women or an
affectionate portrait of men's fear of commitment, it doesn't make
much of a statement. &QL;
</P>

`BLACK CAT, WHITE CAT': GAGS AND SKULDUGGERY IN A FELLINIESQUE
CAPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are below)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Black Cat, White Cat'' was shown as part of last year's New
York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's
review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 3, 1998. The
film _ in Serbo-Croatian and Romany, with English subtitles _ opens
Friday in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The lighter side of Emir Kusturica's boisterous talent is let
loose in ``Black Cat, White Cat.'' It's a mad scramble through the
Felliniesque realm of Kusturica's imagination, and it proves
nothing if not this much: give this man the Danube, Gypsy musicians
and a camera, and you've got a party.
</P>
<P>
   The starting point for ``Black Cat, White Cat'' was Kusturica's
idea of making a documentary about the tuba-toting musicians who
roamed through ``Underground.'' He evidently hoped to dispel some
of the gloom inherent in that film's vision of his native
Yugoslavia, and he began (with Gordan Mihic) to dream up a
cheerfully absurd fable that would do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Most noticeably, Kusturica gave himself the chance to work
rapturously out of doors, bringing high spirits to his innate
fancifulness and earthy humor. This filmmaker takes an ``everything
plus the kitchen sink'' approach to telling even the simplest
story.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Kusturica's one-man war on minimalism has its
excesses. He isn't likely ever to be accused of knowing where (or
when) to stop. But ``Black Cat, White Cat'' is made with such
overriding jubilation that its coarseness is mostly liberating.
There's not a gold tooth here that isn't lingered on lovingly, and
not a pratfall that its characters won't take.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, the film's cast is made up of
nonprofessional Gypsy actors (a big grin seems to have been the
main casting criterion), and they look so plausibly like relatives
that the film's internecine plotting takes on added zest. The
skulduggery here concerns two patriarchs (one a garbage dump
magnate) and a lot of rascally young connivers.
</P>
<P>
   The shifty Matko (Bajram Severdzan), who is the closest thing
here to a hero, becomes involved in both a heist caper and in
marrying off his son Zare (Florijan Ajdini) to the wrong woman,
despite Zare's passion for a siren barmaid named Ida (Branka
Katic). When a wedding finally comes about, the barefoot bride
disguises herself as a tree stump, scampering through the forest in
one of the film's best moments of delirious abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potentially labored side of many gags here (there
are corpses on ice in an attic, zanily concealed until the water
starts dripping), ``Black Cat, White Cat'' is well worth admiring
for its sheer glee. In a repetitive but irresistible turn, Srdan
Todorovic plays a playboy gangster who's a scary, gold-chained
Balkan throwback to the disco days, with a domestic situation
that's wild enough for a movie of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Kusturica so evidently adores this gangster and all of the
film's other characters that ``Black Cat, White Cat'' becomes a
wild, warts-and-all celebration of their lives. Like Fellini, he
finds true grace where it's least expected and makes films utterly,
uncompromisingly his own.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Poking Wounds Within a Family
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're lucky enough, we work for and toward our weakest
area,'' said the filmmaker Alan Berliner, who guessed it was the
psychiatrist Carl Jung who first provided that observation. In any
event, Berliner steered toward family, particularly his own, in
three acclaimed documentaries, ``The Family Album,'' ``Intimate
Stranger'' and ``Nobody's Business,'' to be released on tape on
Tuesday by Milestone Film and Video.
</P>
<P>
   Berliner's films are praised for their introspection. They also
make the commonplace totally involving. ``In `Nobody's Business,'
Alan Berliner illustrates the power of fine art to transform
life,'' Lawrence Van Gelder wrote in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   That film, shown at the New York Film Festival in 1996, was the
third in the series. ``My family life in childhood was very
painful,'' he said. ``I've been inching my way toward `Nobody's
Business.''' The first documentary, ``The Family Album'' (1986),
led him to the general subject of family. A collection of
ingeniously pieced-together snatches from countless home movies,
most from the '30s and '40s, the film touches on life's eras:
babyhood, school, dating, marriage, child rearing, aging, death.
Accompanying them are bits of oral history and family audio
recordings. ``My school isn't like your school; I'll be a laborer
like my father,'' someone says in a typically striking remark.
</P>
<P>
   Storm clouds of trouble suddenly gather: unemployment and money
problems, excessive drinking, fighting, loss of hope and direction,
strangulating marriages, child support (or lack of it). Someone
remarks that there is a sadness to a broken family, a subject
Berliner gets to in ``Nobody's Business.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that, though, came ``Intimate Stranger'' (1991), a film
about his maternal grandfather, Joseph Cassuto, a cotton merchant
whose family bent but never broke through years of separation and
dysfunction. A Palestinian Jew brought up in Egypt, Cassuto worked
for the Japanese Cotton Trading Company in Alexandria. After World
War II, he moved to Japan, where he worked for 11 months of the
year. He left his wife and four children in Brooklyn. In the film
he is described as a man who lived to please his associates. He is
not rated highly as a father. ``There were a lot of things going on
in Brooklyn, U.S.A., but he wasn't around,'' a son says.
</P>
<P>
   The most caustic comments come from Oscar Berliner, Cassuto's
son-in-law, Alan's dedicated father and the subject of Alan's most
accomplished film, ``Nobody's Business.'' In the early '70s, Oscar
and his wife ( Cassuto's daughter) divorced after years of domestic
discord that deeply affected their young children. Now a gruff,
reclusive man in his 80s, the elder Berliner bluntly rebuffs his
son's explanation of the reasons to make a documentary about him,
which, in Alan's view, include the need for father and son to link
with each other and by extension with the world. Oscar says he sees
no such need and ducks behind a who-cares attitude. ``You're trying
to put your head on my shoulders and it won't work,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Alan said, Oscar responded to the standing ovation
he received from the audience at the New York Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   The Prince of Egypt
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to stay frisky through a tale of enslavement and
divine judgment, but Moses (the speaking voice of Val Kilmer) and
Ramses (Ralph Fiennes) are a spirited pair of youths on a collision
course as the Hebrews make their escape from Egypt. Rescued from
the Nile where his mother had set him adrift in a basket (above),
Moses is reared in the Egyptian court before being charged by God
to lead his people from bondage. Trying not to scare the wits out
of young audiences with episodes like the killing of the firstborn,
the film works hard, but, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times,
its ``strenuous efforts to deliver entertainment value are jarring
at first.''
</P>
<P>
   _1998. Dreamworks. $26.99. 97 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.
Release date: Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Cookie's Fortune
</P>
<P>
   Calling on the guerrilla wit of his best ensemble films, Robert
Altman turns Holly Springs, Miss., into a hotbed of power struggles
and flaky behavior. On one side of town a black blues club makes
the atmosphere instantly inviting. In a church on the white side, a
play about Salome and John the Baptist is taking shape under the
iron-handed direction of Camille Dixon (Glenn Close), who insists
on sharing the writing credit with Oscar Wilde. At the center of
the story is the friendship between Cookie (Patricia Neal), a
crusty old lady of wealth, and the handyman Willis Richland
(Charles Dutton), who is closer to her than any of her white
relatives. This is '70s vintage Altman, only more tightly plotted
and directed, ``with a fine cast working on a single, nicely
eccentric wavelength'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   _1999. USA. $108.01. 118 minutes. Closed captioned. 118 minutes.
PG-13. Release date: Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Forces of Nature
</P>
<P>
   A zany drifter (Sandra Bullock) attaches herself to a nervous
groom-to-be (Ben Affleck) on his way to his wedding in Savannah.
Naturally the two become attracted on the trip, which includes some
travel with a senior citizens group and a gay-bar strip scene. Ms.
Bullock may have loopy charm, but the bride-to-be (Maura Tierney)
is at least as appealing and Affleck hasn't the required Cary Grant
aura in a film ``so anxious to bolster this frail comic setup that
it makes every possible detour along the way'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   _1999. Dreamworks. $104.16. 114 minutes. Closed captioned.
PG-13. Release date: Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in
earlier conditions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOMEWHERE IN THE CITY. &LR;  Ramin Niami's self-described ``noir
screwball comedy'' puts together a melange of characters from the
same dumpy Manhattan apartment building. Che, a revolutionary with
a cell phone, is always being interrupted by calls from his mother.
Graham the acting coach is constantly appalled at his know-nothing
students. Betty the therapist talks to teddy bears. And there are
others. Though the film tries too hard to be wacky, some vignettes
are funny and, Anita Gates wrote in The New York Times, `` Niami
has a good eye for the residents of the city's underbelly.'' 1998.
First Run Features. $79.95. 93 minutes. No rating. Release date:
Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LA SEPARATION. &LR;  The time of dissolution has come in the
marriage of Pierre (Daniel Auteuil) and Anne (Isabelle Huppert). To
his bewilderment, she says she loves another, though she remains a
glum, shifty-eyed enigma. Weeks later they explode and part in a
film that purposefully and effectively leaves out much information
about them, their courtship and their life together. ``By not
giving a marital history, it forces us to see for ourselves what is
the matter,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The Times. ``It has to do
with a lack of communication.'' 1998. Fox Lorber. $89.98. French
with English subtitles. No rating.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE. &LR;  Twelve pet alligators enliven the
scene in the household of a Philadelphia blue-blood (Fred
MacMurray), who is training for the Marines (which may explain the
boxing matches going on throughout the house). A restored version
adds 20 minutes to Norman Tokar's film. 1967. Anchor Bay. 164
minutes.

ENTERTAINMENT VENTURES ON WORLD WIDE WEB HAVE GENERALLY FLOPPED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pot of gold does not sit at the end of every Internet rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   Although the World Wide Web appears to be minting millionaires _
and even billionaires _ every day, not every online entrepreneur
winds up striking pay dirt.
</P>
<P>
   John Geirland and Eva Sonesh Kedar provide such a jolt of
reality this month with a book that recounts the failure of online
content developers in delivering viable entertainment programming
to the Internet during the second half of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital Babylon; How the Geeks, The Suits and the Ponytails
Fought to Bring Hollywood to the Internet,'' (Arcade Publishing,
273 pages, $25.95), provides an easy-to-read and informative look
at how start-up companies with grand ambitions for transforming the
Web into an entertainment venue ultimately ran out of the time and
money needed to convert their vision into a mass-market reality.
</P>
<P>
   The authors neatly trace the development of the online
entertainment business through the career of Scott Zakarin, a Web
entrepreneur. Zakarin created the first online soap opera, called
``The Spot,'' in 1995. He later started a company to produce more
online programming and ultimately sold it to industry giant America
Online to focus on creating a Web site called Entertainment Asylum.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, software giant Microsoft was venturing into
online entertainment, molding its Microsoft Network online service
into a platform for delivering programs to entertain online users,
such as its ``Second City Naked News'' comedy show.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, many thought a new entertainment era was unfolding, a
golden age as significant as the early days of cinema or
television, Geirland and Kedar write. The Internet was like
television circa 1947. Like all pioneering times, the early
Internet days were wide-open. But the Internet is still searching
for its own Milton Berle, a star able to capitalize on the power of
the medium in a way that legitimizes the technology in the eyes of
the average viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Most readers of this column, for instance, have probably never
heard of the online shows discussed above, illustrating just how
unsuccessful they have been in cracking the general consumer
market.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Zakarin nor Microsoft was successful in bringing
entertainment to the Web, Geirland and Kedar write. The advertising
that appeared on such programming did not generate enough money to
meet production costs.
</P>
<P>
   By the winter of 1998, the consensus was that Internet
Entertainment had been an exhilarating failure, the authors write.
For all the creativity and money invested, online entertainment
never attracted the audience needed to make it a viable business. A
variety of forces have made the Internet better suited to carry
information than deliver entertainment. The inability of telephone
lines to carry large amounts of data limits how much audio and
video can be delivered to users' computers. Left with a choice of
television or Internet video, most consumers will opt for
television.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, even the programmers are sometimes left wondering
what to do with Internet technology. Even if bandwidth hadn't been
a problem, producers were still puzzled about the nature of
interactivity, Geirland and Kedar write. Zakarin and his team were
learning more about interactivity every day, throwing everything
against the wall to see what would stick. Although Geirland and
Kedar do not spin the tale of an innovator who turned a dream into
an online fortune, their narrative provides a wealth of insight for
executives who are trying to figure out whether their Internet
visions are real or a mirage.

</P>
<P>
   Free Press, $26
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the business opportunity of the century, this
book says, but the trick is turning the trillions of mouse clicks
into hard-core sales. This book, put out by a partner and two
directors at Arthur Andersen, provides an easy-to-read guide on how
companies such as Bloomberg, Barnes &AMP; Noble, TeleBank, Peapod and
others successfully offer goods and services over the Internet. The
authors focus only on marketing and gaining customers, however, and
provide no technical answers on how to set up a net presence.

   The cloak and dagger crowd isn't just in the international

computer system _ there are numerous ways to get information about
your competitors. John Nolan, who spent more than 20 years in

THE EMPEROR STRIKES BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Minutes before the San Francisco mayoral debate
at Mission High School, the neighborhood shook with a huge peal of
thunder. Did Mayor Brown order it through his connections? Did
Clint Reilly buy it? Did Frank Jordan steal someone else's?
</P>
<P>
   The thunder and lightning seemed to portend something great at
Wednesday's debate, but what followed was ugly noise with very few
flashes of brightness.
</P>
<P>
   And if anybody called down that thunder, it was Willie Brown,
because he was the guy in charge in that auditorium _ quite a
contrast to the last debate when he was battered by his tag-team
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Brown brought a loud crowd that heckled and hooted at Reilly and
Jordan. Brown proudly reviewed his accomplishments, such as
rebuilding housing projects, and gracefully defended Emilio Cruz,
the former, much-maligned Muni boss.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brown spoke Emilio Cruz's full name three times in one
sentence, like a magic Mission District incantation.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had a sharp insight into business, pointing to Brown and
then Reilly and saying, ``This one wants to sell City Hall and this
one wants to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly had a decent line about how Brown is ``selling the city
block by block and neighborhood by neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   But in this debate Brown counterpunched like a champ. At one
point, he reeled off a list of the special interests who gave money
to Clint Reilly when he was a political consultant, and then said,
``But I don't want to talk about those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the old Willie Brown. That was what the howling crowd
wanted, for Brown to stick his finger in an opponent's eye, and
then twist it as he pulled it out.
</P>
<P>
   If the last debate was a professional wrestling match, this was
Ultimate Fighting with an audience to match.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year-old Deborah Ortiz, a junior at Mission High School,
was a member of the panel of questioners. Afterward I asked her if
the candidates had answered her question about getting the gangs
and drug dealers off her streets in the Mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidates didn't answer my question,'' Ortiz said. ``They
kept talking about enforcement. I wanted to hear them say they will
take these drug dealers away.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked her if she wanted to go into politics, she made a
fending-off gesture with her hands and said, ``No way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians never answer questions, Deborah,'' said former
Supervisor Angela Alioto, who had stopped by to congratulate her,
perhaps for not leaving the stage in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I told you it was three angry men and an angry
crowd,'' Alioto said to me. ``This time it was worse. I've been in
two (mayor's races) and never seen anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked if it would make it better to have a woman candidate
onstage. ``Anybody would make it better,'' said Alioto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dying to hear about the issues,'' she said. ``Instead
Willie mentioned the names of everybody he ever knew in the
Mission. Frank talked about `your' parades, when they're our
parades. Clint talked about high-tech jobs. High tech? Give us low
tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Give us some other kind of debates. The candidates kept giving
little pre-formed, frozen, microwavable sound bites attacking each
other instead of really listening and answering questions.
</P>
<P>
   The audience was worse than the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   All during the debate a well-dressed woman in back of me kept
yelling ``Shut up'' at a well-dressed man nearby who kept heckling
Jordan and Reilly. ``No, you shut up,'' he yelled back.
</P>
<P>
   I asked young Ortiz if the noise is ever this bad in the Mission
High auditorium when it's filled with kids. She shook her head no,
and said with great understatement, ``It was hectic.''
</P>
<P>
   How about in future debates barring the doors to the
professional political hanger-on class? Let people in who actually
live in the neighborhood. They'd demand more of the candidates and
wouldn't put up with crude behavior in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not just talking about the revolutionary cadres who came
to support ``minor'' candidate Lucrecia Bermudez, who somehow
smuggled in a major bullhorn. They at least had a point to make,
namely why does money determine which candidates get to debate?
</P>
<P>
   They were entertaining, too. A cop played tug-of-war with a
Bermudez backer, with another playing the part of the rope. About
10 people were hauled off by the cops. Why do radical guys grow
ponytails? They make such great carrying handles.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen to the tape of the debate, you can hear Brown
talking to moderator Ysabel Duron during the melee. He said,
``Wackos, total wackos,'' and criticized the lack of control during
the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to be at the symphony this evening ... 6:30 is
the dinner and 8:30 is the performance,'' he can be heard saying on
the tape. ``I was going to be there by 8:30, but obviously I'm
not.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to love this guy. His polls are down around 30 points,
yet he didn't want to be kept late in the Mission and miss the
opening of the symphony.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us were just worried about being hit by lightning on
the way home. Somebody up there has a wild aim. Otherwise the
auditorium at Mission High wouldn't be standin.

KEVIN BACON CARRIES `STIR OF ECHOES' NICELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only real problem with ``Stir of Echoes'' is that a number
of major things about it are strikingly similar to the big summer
hit, ``The Sixth Sense,'' and it's nowhere near as original or
psychologically involving _ or as effective _ a supernatural
thriller.
</P>
<P>
   If you can ignore that humbling fact, however, it makes a
better-than-average occult entertainment, briskly adapted from
Richard Matheson's novel, directed with both intelligence and
genre-flair by David Koepp, and providing Kevin Bacon with an
unusually strong star vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Sixth Sense,'' it deals with a young,
lower-middle-class inner city boy (Zachery David Cope) who displays
a disturbing psychic affinity for communicating with ghosts of the
recent dead _ though, in this case, the boy's not at all tortured
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Also like that film, the ghosts are trying to use the gifted tot
as a medium to communicate with the living, with a specific purpose
in mind _ here, the ghost of a young, mentally handicapped neighbor
woman is trying to put the finger on her own murderer.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the focus quickly shifts from the child to his
father (Bacon), a telephone lineman who, after being hypnotized at
a party, finds he too has the same latent psychic gift, and is
horrified when it gradually starts to take over his life.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the similarity of theme, ``Stir of Echoes'' is much more
of a standard occult thriller/detective story than ``Sixth Sense.''
It doesn't subtly create a hidden world of infinite malevolent
possibilities, and it resolves itself without a surprise that
knocks us right out of our seats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film definitely has its share of hair-raising
moments, writer-director Koepp (``The Trigger Effect'') manages
several genuinely suspenseful sequences, and some of the film's
visuals _ particularly the ones recreating for us the hero's
hypnotic experience _ are striking.
</P>
<P>
   As the Average Joe struggling with the intrusion of a whole new
and terrifying dimension to his life, Bacon carries the movie on
his shoulders nicely. If not quite a ``star turn,'' it's
nonetheless the most believable, heart-wrenching and charismatic
lead performance he's managed in many years.
</P>
<P>
   Stir of Echoes. Directed and written by David Koepp. Cast: Kevin
Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Dunn, Zachery David
Cope. Artisan. 110 minutes. Rated R for supernatural violence.

CATHOLIC CHURCH TAKING IT ON THE CHIN AGAIN IN `STIGMATA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't that many decades ago that the Catholic Church was
celebrated in every other Hollywood movie. Think of all those
dedicated priests played by Spencer Tracy and Pat O'Brien. Even a
film that tried to be hard-edged, like 1963's ``The Cardinal,''
ended up being a valentine.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the very opposite is true, and the church is
really taking it on the chin this fall. Catholic groups have
already mounted a massive campaign against the upcoming ``Dogma''
(for being ``anti-Catholic''), and now we have ``Stigmata,'' a
clumsy occult thriller with the Vatican as the heavy.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a Pittsburgh hairdresser (Patricia Arquette) _ a
chain-smoking, hard-drinking, self-confessed atheist _ who suddenly
starts to display symptoms of stigmata: spontaneous, unexplained
bleeding from the wounds of Christ, as well as powerful
hallucinations.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican dispatches a special investigator (Gabriel Byrne) to
the scene, who soon determines that despite the incongruity of her
atheism, she's the real thing, in spades _ in fact, she bleeds from
more wounds than any saint in Christian history.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it gradually becomes clear to the investigator that
she's the vessel of a recently deceased Brazilian priest (a fact we
learn in the prologue), who is trying to communicate a secret so
powerful it could ``destroy the church.'' And the evil Vatican
powers (no Bing Crosby-like priests here) will resort to anything _
even murder _ to suppress it.
</P>
<P>
   If this description has a faint whiff of deja vu, it may be
because the movie is the third in recent months _ after ``The Sixth
Sense'' and this week's ``Stir of Echoes'' _ about an innocent
young person haunted by a ghost who wants to communicate a secret
to the living world. (How is it that every studio invariably gets
the same idea at the same time?)
</P>
<P>
   The film has an unusual jazzy look (its young director, Rupert
Wainwright, comes from the world of TV commercials) and Patricia
does her best, but it's wildly over-produced, much of it is
unintentionally funny, and _ since we know from the get-go the
woman's possessor is benevolent _ there's not a authentically scary
moment in it.
</P>
<P>
   Stigmata. Directed by Rupert Wainwright. Screenplay by Tom
Lazarus and Rick Ramage. Cast: Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Bryne,
Jonathan Pryce, Nia Long, Rade Sherbedgia. MGM. 101 minutes. Rated
R for horror violence.

`LOVE STINKS' IS AN AWFUL, BADLY ACTED WAR-OF-THE-SEXES TRAVESTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether or not love smells bad, there's no question about ``Love
Stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an awful, misanthropic, deadly unfunny and badly acted
war-of-the-sexes travesty.
</P>
<P>
   The film is supposed to propel TV's ``Third Rock From the Sun''
regular French Stewart to big screen stardom. And it's directed and
written by Jeff Franklin, a veteran of Hollywood who produced
``Stuart Little,'' ``Kull the Conqueror,'' ``Caspar,'' wrote the
1987 comedy ``Summer School'' and directed episodes of the TV
series, ``Full House.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's little that is redeeming or a challenge in this
shrill story about poor schmuck TV sitcom writer Seth Winnick
(Stewart), who meets the supposed girl of his dreams, Chelsea
Turner (Bridgette Wilson), through his best friend, Larry (Bill
Bellamy) and Larry's new wife, Holly (Tyra Banks). Seth and Chelsea
immediately have great sex but afterward Seth finds they have
little else in common.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea, however, feels differently. She's totally desperate to
settle down and she strong-arms Seth into a commitment and finally
an engagement. But when the guy tries to break it off, the girl
ruins his career and life, and the pair resort to warfare and
one-upmanship instead of affection.
</P>
<P>
   But in this forced fatal attraction comedy-spoof, we inevitably
wonder who the bigger dummy is. If a guy is willing to go through
this kind of hell in order to have sex, he deserves what he gets _
especially since the film gives us no reason to think their sex
life is very exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   This woeful parable about dating wants to be as sharp as
``There's Something About Mary'' but it has a nasty heart that's
nearer to ``Very Bad Things.'' It's another mean-spirited film that
finds humor in cruelty to animals and in worse humiliation of
humanity, all for cheap laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Love Stinks. Directed and written by Jeff Franklin. Cast: French
Stewart, Bridgette Wilson, Tyra Banks, Bill Bellamy. Independent
Artists. 93 minutes. Rated R for language, sexual content.

`A STAR CALLED HENRY': ENSLAVED, WITH ABANDON, TO IRISH
INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(dal) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roddy Doyle's last novel, ``Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,'' won the
Booker Prize in England, an event that consolidated the
international reputation of this brilliant Irish writer, the
chronicler of flammable personalities in confrontation with
tinder-dry lives. The flammable personality of Doyle's comically
mournful new novel, ``A Star Called Henry,'' is a young buck from
Dublin, born at the beginning of the century, who is swept into the
zany violence of the war for Irish independence. His name is Henry
Smart, and he is heedless and handsome, a lover and a gangster, a
man who rages, murders and fornicates, all with death-defying
abandon. Henry meets with a similarly profligate cast of characters
as he voyages through Ireland's bloody history.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle's new novel never lets up. It is an unrelenting tumult of
events recounted with tremendous verbal intensity. But it also
seems much of the time to be tumult and intensity for its own sake
_ a contrived larger-than-lifeness. This does not mean that it is a
novel without a theme or direction. Doyle's story is saturated with
politics; the tale of Henry shows the transformation of Irish
politics from a spirited struggle for self-determination into a
cynical grab for power in which assassination becomes a kind of
opium. But that theme is secondary to the dizzying tall tale of
Henry himself, Henry the scrapper, Henry the lover, Henry the
killer and finally Henry who redeems himself. One can be swept up
in Doyle's sheer talent as a storyteller, which is awesome. But
Henry's story itself never achieves the tragic poignancy that he
seems to intend for this book.
</P>
<P>
   The prodigal, extravagant quality of Doyle's new book is evident
from the beginning, in which Henry tells the story of the meeting
of his mother and father. ``Like me, she was never a child,'' Henry
says of Melody Smart, his mother. ``She walked into my father.'' He
was a one-legged bouncer at Dolly Oblong's bordello in Dublin and a
pitiless hit man in the pay of Alfie Landon, a leading figure in
the Dublin underworld. ``She was half his weight, half his height,
six years younger but he fell straight over like a cut tree,''
Henry says of the meeting. ``Love at first sight? Felled by her
beauty? No. He was maggoty drunk and missing his leg.''
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, ``A Star Called Henry'' belongs to the
literature of the drastic harshness of Irish life, its bitterness,
the savagery of its poverty and the consequent extremity of its
desires. Henry is forced to skip childhood. He is on his own almost
from the beginning. ``I grew and stretched and raged around the
room, filled the place with my fists and feet. I got my knees off
the floor and walked. I hit the walls and clawed them. I broke
through the clothes that were put on me. I wailed and cursed, hard
words that came through the open window to me.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he is 14, Henry is a lusty 6 foot 2 and a soldier in
the Volunteers and Citizen Army. Again, the bravery is linked to
the desperate absences of Ireland. ``I was one of the few real
soldiers there; I had nothing to fear and nothing to go home to.''
While World War I is distracting the rest of the world, Henry takes
part in the seizure of the General Post Office in Dublin, the
opening blow of the anti-British war for independence. He becomes a
useful figure in the struggle, a commander of men years before he
could vote. He tears through the hosts of Irish women that plead
for his attention. Eventually he marries a woman he calls Missis
O'Shea _ he doesn't want to know her first name _ who briefly
taught him in school when he was a boy and who becomes a celebrated
killer of British policemen and Irish traitors, continuing long
after Henry has given it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's killing and getting caught and there's killing and not
getting caught,'' Henry tells a group of young recruits. ``And
there's killing the fellas who are paid to catch you.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing comes in wholesale quantities in Doyle's new book,
as does sex and street language, narrow escapes and manly bravado.
Other themes enter into the story. Henry befriends a Latvian Jew
named Climanis, and then he is warned to stay away from him by one
of the emerging dictators of Irish nationalism. ``Did it never
occur to you to ask yourself why they've been run out of every
country they've ever landed in?'' the tyrant asks him of the Jews.
``Or is every other country in Europe wrong?'' The Irish revolution
itself is presented in ``A Star Called Henry'' as an improvident,
improvised, darkly comic event in which blood lust and ruthless
political calculation commingle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot win and winning is not our intention,'' Henry is
told by one of the revolution's leaders. ``What we have to do, all
we can do, is keep at them until it becomes unbearable. To provoke
them and make them mad. We need reprisals and innocent victims and
outrages and we need them to give them to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry tells a tough story and he tells it unapologetically. He
took life as it came without complaining when he was a child, and
now that he is a man and looking back on his first two decades, he
makes no excuses for himself. He illustrates a kind of Irish
machismo that manages to cling to a tattered corner of moral sense.
And yet the episodes of his life, however beautifully depicted in
this novel, seem like set pieces, variations on a genre. Doyle
breathes new life into them by virtue of his stylistic originality
and his use of unusual props, like Henry's father's false leg,
which is both a weapon and a talisman of family identity. Still,
Doyle's personalized trajectory through the landscape of Irish
history leaves the reader both breathless and wondering what he has
learned.

   We were paddling an aluminum canoe under a canopy of trees on a
narrow river that wound through cedar-smelling woods and swamps.
The banks were mossy and dark. It could have been the Bayou or
parts of the Everglades. But this unbroken forest, one of the
largest on the East Coast, was within an hour of Philadelphia and
two hours of New York City, in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. This
was not what we think of when we think of the nation's most densely
populated state, the New Jersey of suburban malls, office parks and
12-lane toll roads.
</P>
<P>
   The tract we chose to explore gas just a fraction of the
1.1-million acres that make up the Pinelands National Forest, which
are thick with cranberry bogs, blueberry bushes, wildlife and
folklore, including the legend of the Jersey Devil, an apocryphal
night creature whose exploits have led to tall tales about
predatory forays on local livestock and sightings by late-night
imbibers for 250 years.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Ty Meredith of Philadelphia and I had a simple
ambition: to see the region as it once was, in its wildest state.
Our goal was to paddle the Mullica River, which runs through about
15 miles of the Pinelands, from Pleasant Mills to Green Bank,
following the stream from its cloistered, fresh-water upper reaches
to the wider, more open lower river, where the water is salty and
affected by the tides of the Great Bay and the Atlantic beyond. We
could experience this transformation over a six-mile stretch in
three hours of easy paddling.
</P>
<P>
   We planned to start in the late afternoon and finish at
twilight, with the rise of the full moon. We left Philadelphia in
Ty's convertible on a recent warm Sunday, yet several miles from
Green Bank, in lower Burlington County, the air was already 10
degrees cooler, and my sense of smell awakened with the fresh scent
of the cedar forest.
</P>
<P>
   It took some searching to find a canoe rental place that would
allow us to take out a vessel after the 5 p.m. closing time. When
we found one, the shop owner generously arranged for us to return
the canoe to his home on a tiny salt creek just off the Mullica
River in Green Bank. We left Ty's car at the owner's house and, in
the shop's van, were driven the six miles up river to Pleasant
Mills, the starting point for our voyage.
</P>
<P>
   In Pleasant Mills, the Mullica is only about 30 feet at its
widest point. It is nearly entirely covered by an overgrowth of
low-hanging trees. Deep in the forest of pitch pine and cedar the
river is a rusty red, the color of tap water in a seldom-used sink.
The color matches that of the cedar trees, but actually comes from
the dissolved iron that permeates the sandy soil and was the basis
of an ambitious cannonball industry during the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   Ty, a veteran of Pine Barren outings, bent to taste the water.
``Try it,'' he said. I demurred. ``Really, it's fresh,'' he said.
``When we get down river, it'll get more salty.''
</P>
<P>
   We shoved off. Our canoe was nothing fancy: an aluminum Grumman
similar to one I used at summer camp in Minnesota a quarter-century
ago. I sat in the bow, which gave me an opportunity to set the
pace, while Ty sat in the stern, or rear, which meant he would have
the job of piloting the 16-foot craft.
</P>
<P>
   A canoe can be steered easily from the stern by holding the
blade of the paddle at a 45-degree angle from the hull, which
forces the boat to turn to that side. A beginning canoeist may
alternate several straight-ahead strokes with one long period of
turning, but this slows the boat. A seasoned sternsman like Ty
incorporates the angled steering motion into every stroke, subtly
but effectively controlling the canoe at all times.
</P>
<P>
   With this skill, Ty guided us through the twisting river, over
and around the fallen branches and foliage: reminders that, at
close inspection, wilderness is rarely pristine. The trees, many of
which were felled by a late-winter snowstorm, presented a hazard
because they were often just below the surface, demanding constant
attention to the waters ahead.
</P>
<P>
   We were enveloped by woods. The wild north bank of the Mullica
is part of the 110,000-acre Wharton State Forest, named for the
19th-Century glassworks manufacturer Joseph Wharton (who also gave
his name to the Wharton School of Business at the University of
Pennsylvania), and restricted from development by the 20-year-old
Pineland Protections Act. The south side of the river is not part
of the forest but at this stage is largely wooded and undeveloped
except for an occasional waterfront cabin.
</P>
<P>
   On the upper reaches of the Mullica we saw only two other canoes
in operation and a handful of swimmers, mainly on the bends where
the water pooled. For the most part the woods were uninhabited, and
that added to the unreality of being in New Jersey. This wasn't
Exit 16E.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped to examine the ruins of a bridge that must have been
two centuries old. The span of the bridge was gone. Only the stone
buttresses remained on each side of the river, lost in the
undergrowth, crumbling on wooden pilings, a ghostly reminder of how
this route was more heavily traveled a century or two ago, when
paths were filled with wagons transporting cannonballs to Valley
Forge or glass to markets to the west and north.
</P>
<P>
   Nature has reclaimed what little had been developed. Some 800
species of plants can be found in the Pine Barrens, including the
wild roses and laurel that flourish on the river banks.
</P>
<P>
   But one flowering plant in particular dominates the shallow
water and tidal flats: the yellow pond lily, also known as
satterdock or cow-lily. The flowers looked beautiful from the
distance, but when I reached for one, it was rubbery, with a waxy
stem. The chalky, golf ball-sized yellow flower had no fragrance,
which seemed appropriate for a plant that had no one around to
smell it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   More than halfway into our trip, the river changed dramatically,
growing wider, reaching out into vast tidal flats. We were no
longer under the roof of trees: the first of several signs we were
leaving the freshwater of the deep forest and entering the domain
of the Great Bay and the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Ty, who has fished extensively in the bays and beaches of New
Jersey, found that the water indeed tasted saltier. Waters that up
river would have been filled with trout and perch might hold
striped bass and bluefish, he said. We could see the change in the
birds, too, from the upland robins and crows, to more seaworthy
Canada geese, snowy egrets and osprey.
</P>
<P>
   The man-made features changed as well. While the north side of
the river, which holds the Wharton State Forest, remained wild,
protected woods, the south bank, near Sweetwater, now resembled the
Jersey Shore, thick with beach houses of all kinds, from two-room
cabins to the stucco minimansions. Wharton might have been
disturbed to hear Jimmy Buffet tunes blasting out of the Sweetwater
Casino, a crowded outdoor tavern with a marina and sightseeing
boat.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly to remind us that nature and casinos can coexist, an
osprey with a five-foot wingspan and vicious-looking talons swooped
to the surface and brought up a fish of 6 to 8 inches. With the
fish flapping in its grasp, the osprey circled over the Sweetwater
Casino before heading back to its nest on the wilderness side of
the river.
</P>
<P>
   Further down river, with twilight approaching, we were buffeted
by the waves of passing power boats, apparently returning from a
day spent down river or in the bays or the ocean. We paddled hard
against the wake to make short work of this stretch of river.
</P>
<P>
   We soon located our destination _ a small saltwater creek, the
tributary off the Mullica where we'd drop off the canoe and pick up
Ty's car. The full moon glowed white in the eastern sky. To the
west, the setting sun was now obscured by the thick trees.
</P>
<P>
   The woods were dark and forbidding: ripe for an apparition of
the Jersey Devil. But the only predators we encountered were more
mundane and more annoying: mosquitoes, which attacked in droves. Ty
wisely had a can of heavy-duty bug repellent at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   With some effort in the near dark, we located a small footpath
to the canoe shop owner's house. We beached the canoe and dragged
it along the wooded path. With the moon filtering through the
pines, I felt like Joseph Wharton himself, savoring the natural
beauty of New Jersey in a more pristine era before the Garden State
sprouted parkways.

   Planning to Paddle
</P>
<P>
   Canoe rentals: Bel Haven Canoe and Kayak Rentals, Route 542,
Green Bank, N.J. (609) 965-2205 or (800) 445-0953. From Exit 52 on
the Garden State Parkway southbound, turn left and go about one
mile to Route 9 south to Route 542 west. Bel Haven is about eight
miles on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Useful gear: Rubber-sole surf shoes, sunscreen,
mosquito-and-tick repellent, personal flotation device. A
waterproof bag is recommended for valuables such as camera,
binoculars, wallet, keys, maps and cellular phone. Be sure to bring
plenty of water, especially in hot weather.
</P>
<P>
   To identify plants, trees, animals, birds, reptiles and insects,
the National Audubon Society Field Guide to the Mid-Atlantic States
(Knopf, $19.95) is helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Camera tip: When using a camera in a canoe, tie 25 feet or so of
fishing line from the camera strap mounts to a seat or secure
brace; many cameras that have gone overboard can be dried and
cleaned quickly without damage to equipment or film.

TOP U.S. GENERAL BACKS CONTINUED COMBAT TRAINING ON VIEQUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told
Congress Thursday that U.S. military forces must continue target
practice on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques until an alternative
bombing range is found.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry H. Shelton, warning that the Pentagon hasn't found a
suitable alternative site, told the Senate Armed Services Committee
that Atlantic-based units of the Navy and Marine Corps need to
practice air-to-ground bombardment, artillery fire and naval
gunfire at the Caribbean firing range in order to be combat-ready
when they deploy to Europe and the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Live-fire combat training has been suspended on Vieques since a
bombing mishap in April killed a Puerto Rican civilian security
guard and injured four others.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's political leaders and their allies in Congress,
many with ties to New York state where First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton is exploring a U.S. Senate race, are urging President
Clinton to end 58 years of military training on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican leaders and many of the 9,300 residents on Vieques
want the Navy to withdraw over a five-year period from 22,000 acres
used for ammunition storage, military maneuvers and target practice
for bombs, rockets and naval gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon review panel was appointed at the request of the
president in June to examine the future use of Vieques by American
armed forces. The panel's report, originally due by Aug. 31, is
expected later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the findings of that panel will be,''
Shelton told the Senate panel.``But certainly if we are required to
give up Vieques, then there needs to be an alternative'' practice
site. The Pentagon panel hasn't found another site that would
``provide the degree of training that Vieques does and would allow
us to deploy in the same `trained-and-ready' status,'' Shelton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton added that ``we need to continue to look to see if there
are alternative sites, but we also need to look at what we could do
to maintain the current site until we could identify an
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's top uniformed commander appeared before the
committee to undergo confirmation for a second two-year term as JCS
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, after studying alternative sites, contends that only
the $720-million bombing range and maneuver area on Vieques offer
the integrated training of Navy and Marine Corps sea, land and air
forces that is required to deploy combat-ready forces.
</P>
<P>
   Four of America's senior military field commanders, whose
responsibilities include Europe, the Persian Gulf, the Atlantic and
Latin America, have written to either Defense Secretary William
Cohen or Shelton to urge resumption of training on Vieques to
assure the combat-readiness of U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials underscored the impact of losing live-fire
training on Vieques on Wednesday by disclosing that the destroyer
USS John Hancock will sail for the Persian Gulf on Sept. 17 with a
``significant degradation'' of its combat readiness because it
wasn't allowed target practice on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee's panel on readiness, scheduled a hearing
for Sept. 22 to delve into the Vieques issue for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced it is absolutely necessary to maintain the
vital military training which has been conducted at Vieques for the
last 58 years,'' Inhofe said. ``There is no other adequate location
in the western hemisphere where Navy pilots can get this kind of
necessary training.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Navy Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon
spokesman, said the chairman of the Pentagon panel, Frank Rush, the
acting assistant secretary of defense for force management policy,
continues to prepare the panel's recommendations for submission to
Pentagon leaders and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Rush is ``being very fastidious in the preparation of this
report,'' Quigley said. ``He wants it to be right and thorough and
very comprehensive, and that has taken some time to accomplish
that.''

`P.T. BARNUM': A BIG LIFE FULL OF BLUSTER, FIT FOR A THREE-RING
CIRCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a man who supposedly said ``There's a sucker born every
minute,'' Phineas T. Barnum turns out to be a sensitive sort, at
least in the new four-hour movie that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Barnum got his start in show business presenting a hoax of a
one-woman production, billing an 80-ish black slave, Joice Heth, as
the 161-year-old former nurse of George Washington. But in A&AMP;E's
two-part movie ``P.T. Barnum,'' he immediately frees her because
``slavery is surely against God's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   When Barnum's wife, Charity, is giving birth to their first
child, Barnum is a century ahead of his time by insisting on being
in the delivery room. (The midwife scolds him, ``You can't come in
here; you're a man.'' To which he responds: ``Balderdash! I'm a
father.'')
</P>
<P>
   And as for that business about suckers, early in the film the
young Barnum (Jordan Bridges) spells out his thoughts on fooling
the public. When Charity (Cynthia Dale) points out that ``a thing
is either true or it's false,'' he says that the public wants to be
amused after their ``humdrum jobs at shops and factories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not deceiving anyone,'' he insists. ``People believe what
they want to. Deep down they know the truth. But if for just one
moment they can imagine something that could not be _ yet believe
it all the same _ then who's the poorer?'' (Not Barnum. He goes on
to invent the rain check, the press conference, the publicity stunt
and the three-ring circus.)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``P.T. Barnum,'' directed by Simon Wincer, has come down
with the latest case of the social-attitude-anachronism disease
that afflicted ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Chetwynd, who wrote the film, has also occasionally given
his 19th-century characters some suspiciously contemporary
dialogue. ``Are you ready to play with the big boys?'' George
Hamilton, as a devious, mustachioed New York lawyer, asks Barnum.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from that, this is a largely entertaining four hours.
Both Beau Bridges (who plays Barnum from around the time of his
second daughter's birth to old age) and Jordan Bridges, his son,
give the title character believable charm and bluster. Following
Barnum's real life fairly faithfully, the film becomes a lesson in
suffering ups and downs, trying again and accepting grief as a
natural part of life. In the course of the film, 19th-century
mortality rates being what they were, Barnum loses two daughters, a
grandchild and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The real Barnum was born in 1810 in Bethel, Conn., and died in
1891 in Bridgeport, Conn. When he made it big, he built Iranistan,
a fantastical three-story house in Bridgeport, but he spent much of
his adult life in New York and on tour. Barnum's American Museum,
with exhibits including human ``freaks,'' was in Manhattan, as was
his first circus, at Barnum's Hippodrome.
</P>
<P>
   In the end he owed it all to the press and said so. ``Without
printer's ink, I should be no bigger than Tom Thumb,'' he said,
referring to his most famous ``discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnum recognized the power of the printed word early in life;
his first job was publishing his weekly newspaper, The Herald of
Freedom, as a teen-ager. And in the end, just as the film shows, a
New York newspaper really did publish his obituary early _ so he
could enjoy reading it.

   SOUTH CAROLINA-WESTVACO-LAND. The Nature Conservancy and
Westvaco announced their plans Thursday to join forces in the
spirit of environmentalism. Westvaco will give the Nature
Conservancy access to more than 1 million acres of Westvaco land --
including more than 400,000 acres in South Carolina -- to assess it
for biodiversity value. The odd coupling of an environmental group
and a forestry company was hailed as ``historic'' by the new
partnership's representatives. (12 inches.) By Elizabeth Hurt

AN ARCHITECT WHO QUIETLY LEFT A MARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among those who have influenced young architects over the past
two centuries, Sir John Soane (1753-1837) is a stealth bomber.
Certainly, the work of this idiosyncratic British neoclassical
architect has had a broad impact on design professionals. But it
has rarely shown up on popular radar screens like coffee-table
books or shelter magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In his own country, after his death, Soane was rejected by the
adherents of nearly every 19th-century movement _ Esthetic, Arts
and Crafts, Gothic Revival and Art Nouveau. In this century, until
fairly recently, he was largely ignored by the Modernists as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a one-off, a cul-de-sac in the history of architecture,''
said Christopher Woodward, a curator at the Soane Museum in London.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Soane was not well known until the early
1950s, when Philip Johnson, now considered the dean of American
architects, copied one of Soane's rooms for the guest house of his
famous Glass House in New Canaan, Conn. And in his speeches and
writing, Johnson, founder of the department of architecture at the
Museum of Modern Art in New York, almost single-handedly ignited
interest in Soane among American architects _ modernists,
postmodernists and classicists _ as well as among interior
designers.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 11, the Royal Academy of Arts in London will open
``John Soane, Architect: Master of Space and Light,'' a
retrospective that runs through Dec. 3, then moves in March to the
Centro Palladio in Vicenza, Italy, and, in July, to Paris' Musee
des Monuments Francais in the Palais de Chaillot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to honor Soane at the Royal Academy,'' said MaryAnne
Stevens, the senior curator at the Royal Academy, who initiated the
show, ``because he taught architecture here for 31 years and
because he has a very particular relevance for architects today.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, designed by Piers Gough, features Soane's
architectural drawings; about 50 cork and wood models, including
several made by Soane himself; a reconstruction, at 70 percent
scale, of a spectacular domed banking hall, and a computerized
walk-through of the immense Bank of England, which was considered
Soane's masterpiece, and was demolished in the 1920s. There is also
a new Murray Grigor film on Soane and a new 6-by-6-foot model of
the entire bank complex.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are two new books on Soane _ ``Soane, an
Accidental Romantic'' (Yale University Press), a biography by
Gillian Darley that just came out, and ``Sir John Soane and the
Country Estate'' (Ashgate), by an architect, Ptolemy Dean, to be
published in October.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Darley will talk about her book at a lecture organized by
the Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts and the
Sir John Soane's Museum Foundation at the House of the Redeemer, 7
E. 95th St., on Nov. 11. Robert Rosenblum, professor of Fine Arts
at New York University, will lecture at Christie's on ``Soane: In
and Out of Context'' on Oct. 18. Both talks are fund-raisers for
the Soane Museum in London. Information: (646) 654-0085.
</P>
<P>
   When Soane died, he bequeathed to the nation the astonishing
London town house he designed at No. 13 Lincoln's Inn Fields and
all his papers and works of art. The museum has been open ever
since. It is chock-full of paintings and drawings, plaster casts of
architectural elements and a full-size Apollo Belvedere.
Beautifully arranged in three-story-tall galleries with skylights,
the collections are now fairly well known.
</P>
<P>
   But Soane's architecture is not. Ms. Stevens said she hoped the
Royal Academy show would correct this and illustrate Soane's
distinctive take on classicism.
</P>
<P>
   She explained: ``Soane is most innovative in his handling of
light in interiors. What he invented was how a canopy ceiling can
be used to filter light into internal spaces in an unobtrusive but
dramatic way. Look how his ceilings sit. He brings a domed ceiling
to the floor in one curving line. There are no capitals or
entablatures to stop the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also called Soane a ``ceiling architect.'' ``That's not
trying to make him look small,'' Johnson is quoted as saying in the
catalog for the Royal Academy show. ``When you think of one's
actual experience of ceilings, you mean wall, ceiling, enclosure
and light. I copied Soane's Breakfast Room twice in two different
places where I live, and it's the most cuddly, marvelous feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Richardson, curator of the Soane Museum, added: ``Soane
contrives his interior architecture so that the spaces flow one
into another, both horizontally and vertically. With Soane, rooms
are no longer conventional boxes with windows. His ceilings do all
kinds of things. In his amazing handling of space and light, he was
very much ahead of his time.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward of the Soane Museum said: ``Most domes are heavy and
static. Soane's seem to soar up from the ground. His domes are
really canopies. It's as if he were trying to stretch a silk
handkerchief across a room, to give it uplift. He wants to impart a
sensation of lightness and transparency. This is what influences
architects today.''
</P>
<P>
   Soane was the very definition of the self-made man in an era
when lineage and class were all-important. The son of a poor
country bricklayer in Reading, England, Soane was the youngest of
seven. By sheer happenstance, a kindly London architect named
George Dance noticed him working at a building site when he was 15
and recognized his talents. The year was 1768, and suddenly Soane
went to work for Dance, living in his house in London while
apprenticing in the architecture office.
</P>
<P>
   Like his contemporary Thomas Jefferson, Soane had great
intellectual curiosity and took full advantage of Dance's fine
architecture library. Dance, in turn, became so proud of his
protege that he encouraged him to apply to the new Royal Academy, a
free school underwritten by King George III.
</P>
<P>
   Soane was accepted, one of three architects among the 77
students. In 1776, after several tries, he won the academy's
prestigious Gold Medal, which entitled him to a three-year
traveling scholarship to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   There, he carefully measured dozens of ancient classical temples
and ruins. He also became friends with many rich Englishmen making
the obligatory Grand Tour _ some of whom later became clients.
</P>
<P>
   Soane returned to England in 1780 and established his
architectural practice. An indefatigable worker, he suffered
several setbacks but by the age of 35 had been appointed architect
to the Bank of England, a project that would occupy him for 45
years. He restored, added on to and built several country houses in
England, as well as the Dulwich Picture Gallery, and the Law Courts
at Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   Today Soane is an inspiration for architects like Johnson,
Richard Meier, Robert Venturi, Michael Graves and Rafael Moneo. As
Ms. Richardson wrote in the catalog, ``In the last 30 years
architects have admired Soane's handling of space and light above
everything; they find his work relevant and stimulating.''
</P>
<P>
   The radar screen is beginning to make out the stealth bomber.

 &HT;    MEXICAN OPPOSITION PARTIES BOLSTERED AFTER PRI CANDIDATES TRASH
THEMSELVES, PARTY IN DEBATE
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Members of Mexico's ruling Revolutionary
Institutional Party _ the PRI _ lashed out at each other like sworn
enemies during this country's first presidential primary debate
here.
</P>
<P>
   They called each other two-faced liars and lousy leaders. And
before a television audience of millions Wednesday night they said
that the country their own party has governed for 70 years is awash
in crime, corruption and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate between the candidates of the PRI is a documented
confession of the failure of their governments for 70 years,'' said
a gleeful press release issued after the debate by the National
Action Party, Mexico's conservative opposition. ``It's clear now
that to achieve true change the PRI must be removed from
government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the debate there is only one indisputable conclusion:
none of the PRI's candidates would vote for their own party,'' said
columnist F. Bartolome, writing in Mexico City's Reforma newspaper,
whose editorial line is usually anti-PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's debate among four PRI presidential aspirants was
billed as a shining example of new democracy for Mexico and the
PRI. The party, which has controlled Mexico's presidency for seven
decades, is struggling to rebuild its corrupt, autocratic image by
holding its first primary election ever on Nov. 7. The winner of
that primary will go on to run in Mexico's July 2, 2000 general
election, in which the PRI is expected to face its biggest
challenge yet from opposition candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the debate, polls are split over who emerged as a
clear winner among the four PRI candidates for the nomination. But
analysts say one outcome is certain: the PRI will have to explain
why the candidates implicitly trashed their own president and party
by focusing so much on the country's troubles with crime,
corruption and social inequality.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, the PRI has to face the opposition,'' said Luis
Linares, a legislative analyst for the Mexican Senate. ``The
opposition is going to say, 'You yourselves say we need a change.
Well, the change we need is taking you out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Linares suggested, however, that the PRI could salvage its image
by trying to play up the fact that it is the only party in Mexico
so far that has scheduled an open primary in which any voter can
cast a ballot. It is also, so far, the only party to hold a debate
among its contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders for the PRI's nomination are Francisco
Labastida, the former interior secretary, and Roberto Madrazo, the
former governor of Tabasco state.
</P>
<P>
   The other two aspirants, Humberto Roque Villanueva and Manuel
Bartlett, inched up in polls after the debate _ perhaps, analysts
said, because they talked about proposals instead of attacking
their rivals.
</P>
<P>

NEW LEAD IN `WIT' TRANSCENDS A TV PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By PETER MARKS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For several years, Judith Light was a star of ``Who's
the Boss?,'' a popular sitcom on ABC. The show had a silly,
made-for-each-other premise: Ms. Light played a Connecticut
advertising executive and single mother who hired Tony Danza as a
live-in housekeeper and babysitter for her son.
</P>
<P>
   The program remained on the air long enough to freeze Ms. Light
in the minds of viewers as another of those sympathetic creatures
of television comedy who thrive on a humdrum diet of glib retorts
and artfully raised eyebrows. After the show's cancellation, she
graduated to a lucrative servitude in made-for-television movies.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Light, following in the path of Danza, who appeared on
Broadway this year in ``The Iceman Cometh,'' has gravitated back to
the theater, and not for the kind of limiting roles she took on in
her sitcom days.
</P>
<P>
   The play she has been cast in is the pride of last season,
``Wit,'' Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama, and the
assignment she landed was replacing Kathleen Chalfant, who earned
praise across the board for her portrayal of a literature professor
dying in the oncology unit of a teaching hospital.
</P>
<P>
   This might have been an occasion for cynical theater types to
gloat over the error of casting to the requirements of Nielsen
families. But it's not. The folly uncovered here is that Ms. Light
has avoided the stage for far too long.
</P>
<P>
   Her performance as Vivian Bearing, the John Donne scholar
struggling to hold on to her dignity as fiercely as the doctors
seem eager to suction it away, cuts poignantly close to the bone.
It is the sort of transformational work that would hint at other
future successes, with Shakespeare, maybe, if a full-time career in
the theater were truly an option these days. In any event, it gives
rise to a wish. Ms. Light, don't touch that dial again, at least
not for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edson's gift to middle-aged actresses is a humdinger of a
role, but also one of amazonian trials. Vivian is onstage at the
Union Square Theater, with shaved head and hospital gown, from
curtain up to curtain call, two hours in all.
</P>
<P>
   She must engage an audience, one perhaps a bit fearful of the
subject matter, with the intellectual authority she brings to bear
on her personal calamity. With ferocious clarity and, yes, with
wit, Vivian narrates the story of her approaching death.
</P>
<P>
   Haughty and dry-eyed, she may be secure in her independence and
her academic achievements. Yet she has paid dearly for her sense of
self-worth, and now must find the humility to draw herself out of
her isolation and face a final, terrible challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chalfant's naturally patrician bearing allowed her to work
from the inside out; you could feel Vivian's cool cerebration
yielding to the terror of the inescapable. Ms. Light has a softer
core, and so her Vivian is less acerbic, and more vulnerable.
Whereas Ms. Chalfant seemed a tactician obsessed with the challenge
of decoding Donne's poetry _ the play flashes back to episodes in
Vivian's academic career _ Ms. Light is an entertainer infatuated
with the theatricality of the lecture hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wit'' is an ambitious play, rife with paradoxes. It explores
the limits of art and science in coming to grips with the end of
life and how, ultimately, words and machines all fail. Yet it is a
mere exercise without a galvanizing central performance of the sort
that Ms. Light provides.
</P>
<P>
   Her innate feel for the theater, the ease with which she takes
us into her confidence, are apparent in a harrowing and deeply
affecting portrayal. The death-camp pallor mutes her prettiness,
but the supple voice _ a rarity in actors groomed in television
studios _ remains an instrument of refinement.
</P>
<P>
   One can imagine these vocal cords stirring a morning class
awake. These are all qualities that bind one to Ms. Light's Vivian,
even if the instinct is to run for cover, and she holds us through
the play's searing final scenes, in which the abstractions of
Vivian's ovarian cancer yields to the stark reality.
</P>
<P>
   The cast has changed substantially since ``Wit'' opened in New
York a year ago; the sole holdover in a major role is the
outstanding Paula Pizzi, playing an empathic nurse, preparing
either for her boards or beatification.
</P>
<P>
   Of the new arrivals, William Cain and Sally Parrish provide
solid support as Vivian's primary doctor and academic mentor. Grant
Show, a well-known face thanks to his steamy seasons on ``Melrose
Place,'' is disappointingly stiff, but then so is the character he
plays, a cancer researcher unable to view his patients as anything
but specimens.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes, though, are on Ms. Light, as well they should be. Her
conjuring up of an unstoppable life force as it draws to a halt is
cause for grief, but mostly exaltation. No wonder the lighting
designer Michael Chybowski blankets her final exit _ one of the
great treatments of nudity on a contemporary stage _ in ethereal
white light. When she departs, it is truly in a blaze of glory.

NEW STAIRCASE PLANNED FOR BROOKLYN MUSEUM  
 AUCTIONS ANNOUNCED AT SOTHEBY'S AND CHRISTIE'S  
 WHITNEY NAMES CURATOR FOR POSTWAR ART 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- ART-NOTES -NYT  (dw) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 C.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 13-year-old plan for a new version of the grand
staircase that once adorned the facade of the Brooklyn Museum of
Art is inching its way to reality. The staircase, which was
designed by McKim, Mead &AMP; White in 1907, was removed in 1934 when
modernists declared the Beaux-Arts style elitist.
</P>
<P>
   Now museum officials want to replace the staircase, which faced
Eastern Parkway. The steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art are a
popular place for visitors to linger, and the Brooklyn Museum wants
to provide a similarly welcoming gathering spot.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Golden, the Brooklyn Borough president, said in July that
his office had allocated $14 million from its capital budget to
help pay for the project. ``The new front steps on Eastern Parkway
will make this institution more accessible and more inviting to
visitors from around the world,'' Golden said. The money is to go
to the museum in installments during the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Golden's office is only too happy to discuss the
project, the museum has made no announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing something of major proportions, but we don't have
anything to show the public yet,'' said Arnold L. Lehman, director
of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The building is a city landmark and changes to it must be
approved by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the museum hired the architectural team of Arata Isozaki
&AMP; Associates and the Polshek Partnership to create a master plan
for the building, which houses the second-largest museum in New
York after the Metropolitan Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The design is still very much in process,'' Lehman said.
Although he declined to elaborate on any plans, sources close to
the museum said that the plans included creating tiered steps that
form a semicircle. The steps would create a more open entrance and
provide a setting for outdoor concerts and performances.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman would not discuss the cost of the project, and one reason
may be that he is raising money before announcing a major capital
campaign drive. Museum officials have also been discussing their
plans with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in hopes that the museum could
raise more money from the city. Like some cultural institutions,
the museum receives about a third of its annual operating expenses
from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is expected to begin in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   AUCTION ARRIVALS
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While things seemed quiet at Sotheby's and Christie's
during July and August, experts at the auction houses have been
scrambling to get material for their important Impressionist,
modern and contemporary art auctions this fall.
</P>
<P>
   So far both houses have scored a few big-ticket paintings and
sculptures, but officials at Sotheby's and Christie's said that
executors of some estates have yet to decide between the two
houses.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, most sellers want to remain anonymous. But some names
and collections are so well known that even though the auction
houses aren't talking, dealers and collectors are. One example
comes from the collection of the Sultan of Brunei, which includes
works by Monet and Degas to be sold at Sotheby's in November.
</P>
<P>
   Among the offerings is ``Little Dancer at Age 14, an 1881 Degas
sculpture carrying a $10 million to $12 million estimate. The
Sultan bought it from the collection of William Mayer Goetz, a
founder of 20th Century Fox, and his wife, Edith, at a Christie's
sale in New York in 1988. He paid $10.1 million, a record price for
a Degas sculpture at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Charles S. Moffett, the co-chairman of Sotheby's Impressionist
and modern art worldwide, declined to discuss the Sultan's
consignment. ``Most of our property has come in in one's and two's
from lots of various owners scattered all over the place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Franck Giraud, the head of Christie's department of 19th- and
20th-century art, said many collectors decided to sell this fall
because the stock market is so strong. Christe's has already won
two estates. The biggest, a collection of about 200 works that
includes 19th-century and Impressionist art, Old Master paintings
and French furniture, will be sold in New York and Monaco in
November and December. The property belonged to Akram Ojjeh, a
Syrian-born financier who died in 1991. Among the star offerings in
New York on Nov. 8 is van Gogh's ``Bridge at Trinquetaille''
(1888), which is expected to bring $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's is also selling 19th- and 20th-century art from the
estate of Erika Meldola Fallek, a Manhattan pediatrician who died
in the spring. Her collection features Matisse's ``Woman Holding an
Umbrella'' (1920), with an estimate of $4 million to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks both auction houses hope to make further
announcements. The fate of estates like the San Francisco
collection of Madeleine Haas Russell are still being decided.
</P>
<P>
   MARLA PRATHER NAMED WHITNEY'S CURATOR OF POSTWAR ART &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A major piece of the curatorial puzzle at the Whitney
Museum of American Art has been put in place this week. Marla
Prather, the curator and head of the 20th-century art department at
the National Gallery of Art in Washington, has been named the
Whitney's curator of postwar art.
</P>
<P>
   The job comes with geographic advantages for Ms. Prather. Since
her marriage three years ago to Mortimer B. Zuckerman, co-publisher
and owner of The Daily News, she has been commuting between New
York and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For the Whitney, the appointment is important and Maxwell L.
Anderson, the museum director, said it took many months of
discussions. ``Marla is one of the nation's leading scholars in
20th-century art,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Gallery Ms. Prather organized large
retrospectives for Calder and de Kooning and was the curator of its
sculpture garden, which opened in May.

 MAKING `ROSWELL' FEEL REAL

 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a

 (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., SEPT. 20, 1999) 
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of David Nutter
directing a scene from ``Roswell.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Call him a reality freak.
 &HT;    David Nutter may be most widely known as the director of some of
television's weirdest shows _ at 39, he's helmed multiple episodes
of ``Millennium,'' ``Sleepwalkers'' and ``Space: Above and
Beyond,'' as well as 15 hours of ``The X-Files,'' including the
top-notch ``Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose.''
 &HT;    But he likes his weirdness ... well, real.
 &HT;    ``The more real, the more accessible you can make a television
show or movie, the more you can ground it and the more powerful it
can be for an audience,'' Nutter says. ``If it feels real for an
audience, people will be affected by what they see.
 &HT;    ``Once people care about what they see, they'll care about the
characters,'' he adds. ``Then you can throw paranormal and sci-fi
elements at them and they'll still care.''
 &HT;    After a break from television to make the ill-fated movie
``Disturbing Behavior'' last year, Nutter returns to the small
screen as co-executive producer of ``Roswell'' The
much-buzzed-about sci-fi saga debuts Oct. 6 on the WB with an
hour-long pilot _ directed by Nutter, naturally.
 &HT;    ``Roswell'' turns the spotlight on Liz Parker (Shiri Appleby)
and Max Evans (Jason Behr), high-school students in Roswell, N.M.,
the fabled site of purported alien activity in 1947. When a bullet
rips through Liz's body, Max saves her life with a single touch,
and the teens connect on an intimate and otherworldly level.
 &HT;    Liz is human, of course, and Max is a descendant of the
extraterrestrials who crashed to Earth a half-century ago. Max's
actions leave him, his sister Isabel (Katherine Heigl) and their
friend Michael (Brendan Fehr) vulnerable to exposure.
 &HT;    Should the trio flee? Will Max and Liz ever give in to their
feelings for each other? Can Liz's friends (Majandra Delfino and
Colin Hanks) keep their mouths shut?
 &HT;    And what about Sheriff Valenti (William Sadler), who has great
interest in the events of 1947, and his son Kyle (Nick Wechsler),
who happens to be Liz's beau?
 &HT;    ``We don't want chuckles,'' Nutter says during a weekend
telephone call from his Los Angeles home. ``When you describe the
show to someone and say, `It's three kids in Roswell and they're
really aliens,' people are going to go, `Yeah, yeah. It sounds like
a teen kids show. It sounds kind of silly.'
 &HT;    ``We've tried to avoid all those things,'' he says. ``And,
fortunately, I think we did. Probably what I found to be the
greatest challenge in the pilot was getting the audience to believe
the setting, which goes back to what I said about needing to make a
show and the characters believable.''
 &HT;    Though doubters are already suggesting that ``Roswell'' is the
inevitable result of someone tossing ``Dark Skies,'' ``Dawson's
Creek,'' ``The X-Files'' and a Jonathan Frakes-hosted alien-autopsy
special into a blender, Nutter isn't sweating it. Nor, he says, are
co-executive producers Jason Katims, Lisa J. Olin and ... well, OK,
Jonathan Frakes.
 &HT;    ``We're too busy working on the show to worry much about that,''
Nutter says. ``Who has time? We're just trying to make the best
show we can.
 &HT;    ``We want to bring our own sensibilities to the show.''
 &HT;    Imbuing a show with his own sensibility is new for Nutter. As a
hired-gun director, he's used to arriving on the set, doing his job
and then heading home, but as a ``Roswell'' producer he's been
deeply involved from day one.
 &HT;    ``It's actually something I'm learning to enjoy _ or trying to
enjoy,'' he says, laughing. ``It makes me appreciate even more
everything Chris Carter does.
 &HT;    ``I'm helping to cut the show,'' he explains. ``I'm on the set
to watch it shoot. I'm involved in the casting, the music, the
main-title sequence. I'm dealing with the studio when it comes to
scripts, to make sure they're as strong as they have to be, and
also with the financial issues.
 &HT;    ``There are all kinds of hats I have to wear, and they're always
shifting and being juggled.''
 &HT;    All in all, it's a pretty amazing gig for a guy who not so long
ago fancied himself the next Barry Manilow.
 &HT;    ``Before `The X-Files' I was a music student,'' Nutter says. ``I
was always a romantic soul, so to speak.
 &HT;    ``When I got `The X-Files,' I got a chance to explore that as
much as possible with Chris, but it wasn't pushed too hard,'' he
says. ``The show didn't make melodrama out of drama and it didn't
make powerful emotional beats out of schmaltz.
 &HT;    ``That restraint was something I thought was important to carry
with me into `Roswell,''' he adds. ``I really think this is one of
the first sci-fi shows that has such an emotional love story and
such a romantic sensibility to it.
 &HT;    ``The sci-fi audience will hopefully be invited into that, enjoy
that and be touched by it.''

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. (Star) denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings
and running times are in parentheses. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``ALL THE LITTLE ANIMALS,'' starring John Hurt, Christian Bale
and Daniel Benzali. Directed by Jeremy Thomas (R, 90 minutes). This
gripping moral fable (adapted from Walker Hamilton's novel) with an
animal-rights agenda follows the flight of Bobby ( Bale), a gentle,
mentally disturbed young man, from the clutches of his monstrous
stepfather (Benzali). Taken in by an eccentric woodland hermit (
Hurt), Bobby becomes the assistant in his life's work, which
consists of burying animals and protecting wildlife from human
savagery. The movie turns nasty when the evil stepfather barges
into their idyll. But why is it that the characters who wouldn't
dream of stepping on a cockroach are also homicidal? (Stephen
Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE,'' starring Johnny Depp and Charlize
Theron. Written and directed by Rand Ravich (R, 100 minutes).
Stylish direction and the heat generated by these two stars can't
outweigh the familiarity of the story line. It concerns an
astronaut who returns to Earth behaving a little strangely. And not
for nothing does Ms. Theron, as the title character, wear the
hairdo seen on Mia Farrow in ``Rosemary's Baby.'' Even creatures in
other galaxies can guess what's coming. Still, the visual style
suggests that this first-time director might fare better with
fresher material. And Depp holds interest by playing the astronaut
as one part NASA, two parts Elvis (Janet Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT,'' starring Heather Donahue, Michael
Williams and Joshua Leonard. Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez (R, 87 minutes). A horror film shot outdoors by its actors,
who play three scared filmmakers at work on a spooky documentary,
this is a fine example of how to make something out of nothing _
nothing but terrific imagination and a game plan so enterprising it
should elevate its creators to pinup status at film schools
everywhere. With tentacles including a hit Web site, an elaborate
fake witch mythology, a book tie-in, a special on the Sci-Fi
Channel and much more, this clever little indie is at the center of
a new form of synergy and an inspired multimedia blitz (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``BOWFINGER,'' starring Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy and
Heather Graham. Written by Martin. Directed by Frank Oz (PG-13, 97
minutes). This hilarious, good-hearted spiritual descendant of
``The Producers'' is a comic coup for Martin. And it's directed by
Oz every bit as winningly as his ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' and
``In and Out.'' Murphy is razor-sharp in a dual role as both a
grinning fall guy and the kind of hotshot action star whose very
presence is enough to get a movie made. Martin, sublimely funny,
runs circles around him as an unscrupulous filmmaker trying to
trick the star into appearing in his movie. ``Did you know that Tom
Cruise had no idea he was in that vampire movie until two years
later?'' this filmmaker inquires. Made fondly and knowingly, with
nonstop good humor (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``CHILL FACTOR,'' starring Cuba Gooding Jr., Skeet Ulrich, Peter
Firth and David Paymer. Directed by Hugh Johnson (R, 110 minutes).
A deadly chemical defoliant (military code name Elvis) must be
transported to a safe place across the Montana high country in a
rattling ice cream delivery truck before it falls into the hands of
a maniacal traitor ( Firth) who wants to peddle it on the
international market. Gooding, clowning it up, is the hapless
driver, and Ulrich is his guide. Stale macho jokes and formulaic
cliffhangers drive this chase-by-numbers thriller on the bumpy road
to nowhere (Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``DEEP BLUE SEA,'' starring Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, L L
Cool J, Jacqueline McKenzie, Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgard
and Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by Renny Harlin (R, 100 minutes).
Better not mess with Mother Nature. That's the familiar message of
this man-against-shark horror film in which the research team of a
floating ocean laboratory is stalked by three 8,000-pound
genetically ``improved'' mako sharks. Ms. Burrows is the chilly,
anything-for-science marine biologist behind the research, and Jane
the hunky shark wrangler who tends these razor-toothed killing
machines. ``Titanic'' meets ``Jaws,'' without romance, history,
myth or credible characters, only nonstop action and half an ocean
full of crimson, blood-thickened water (Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``DUDLEY DO-RIGHT,'' starring Brendan Fraser, Alfred Molina,
Sarah Jessica Parker and Eric Idle. Directed by Hugh Wilson (PG, 90
minutes). Based on the vintage Jay Ward animated series, this
live-action romp tries to be both zany entertainment for children
and nostalgia for those who grew up on Ward's snarky creations
(Rocky, Bullwinkle et al). And it works pretty well, too. Beyond
the sure-fire goofy presence of Fraser and the comic possibilities
of a Canadian Mountie who rides his horse backward, this jokey romp
has an appealing, try-anything spirit. The characters now use cell
phones. And Ms. Parker's Nell, who formerly spent her time tied to
the railroad tracks, has become a former United States ambassador
to Guam. But the formula hasn't lost its fun (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``EYES WIDE SHUT,'' starring Tom Cruise and Nicole
Kidman. Directed by Stanley Kubrick (R, 145 minutes). This last
cryptic, spellbinding addition to the Kubrick canon provides a
stunning epiphany for the summer of the dirty joke. It's a
dead-serious film about eros and mortality, one that flirts with
the ridiculous but sustains its fundamental eeriness and gravity
throughout. Cruise, as a doctor caught up in a nighttime sexual
odyssey of strange, dreamlike clarity, and Ms. Kidman, as the wife
who sparks his jealousy by speaking frankly of her own libido, give
themselves over body and soul to the filmmaker's meticulous and
delicately balanced scheme. Given the dark themes and explicit
nudity found here, the R rating (achieved by digital alterations to
65 seconds' worth of film) is a joke (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``ILLUMINATA,'' starring John Turturro, Katherine Borowitz,
Susan Sarandon, Rufus Sewell, Christopher Walken and Donal McCann.
Directed by Turturro (R, 111 minutes). An enormously fond homage to
the world of acting, beguilingly presented and full of knowing
backstage humor. The usual suspects _ the aging diva (Ms.
Sarandon), the self-involved leading man (Sewell), the idealistic
aspiring playwright ( Turturro) _ are played invigoratingly, as is
Walken's snide Transylvanian-sounding critic. Turturro and Ms.
Borowitz, his somberly beautiful wife, play out a delicate balance
of love and ambition against this nicely tumultuous backdrop
(Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``MICKEY BLUE EYES,'' starring Hugh Grant, James Caan and Jeanne
Tripplehorn. Directed by Kelly Makin (PG-13, 102 minutes). The
newest Mafia comedy, which features several cast members from ``The
Sopranos'' along with Caan as a New York mob boss, plays like a
spoof of a spoof of a spoof. Grant is amusing as a suave English
art auctioneer who finds his business used as a money-laundering
operation after he becomes engaged to a Mafia princess (Ms.
Tripplehorn). Although the movie is little more than a series of
loosely connected gags, several are extremely funny. One of the
cutest running jokes involves the hopeless attempts of Grant's
character to impart properly thuggish inflections to phrases like
``forget about it.'' ``Fuggedaboudit'' is simply beyond his reach
(Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE MUSE,'' starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie
MacDowell and Jeff Bridges. Written by Brooks and Monica Johnson.
Directed by Brooks (PG-13, 97 minutes). In his latest mordantly
hilarious cri de coeur about contemporary life, the ever-grousing
Brooks takes on the capriciousness of success in a world of
show-business ethics. And in coming up with the title character,
played by Ms. Stone in a delectable comic performance, he gives
that world exactly the kind of divinity it deserves. This muse is
quite a piece of work, but she seems to get results, on the
evidence of a couple of inspired cameos here. The joke of a premise
winds down before it reaches a punch line. But Brooks again manages
to be funny and bleak with equal ease (Maslin). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE,'' starring Shawn Hatosy, Alec
Baldwin, Amy Smart and George Wendt. Written by Peter Farrelly,
Bobby Farrelly and Michael Corrente. Directed by Corrente (R, 95
minutes). Three of Rhode Island's finest, the director of ``Federal
Hill'' and the brothers behind ``There's Something About Mary,''
collaborate on a rowdily funny yet also unexpectedly tender
coming-of-age tale. This rueful and very likable comedy tells of a
Pawtucket teen-ager who is abruptly separated from his druggy old
cronies and packed off to a Connecticut prep school, where he is a
sharp-eyed observer of the characters around him. Loosely knit,
sometimes uproarious, the film benefits enormously from Baldwin's
deft performance as the boy's small-minded, memorably impossible
father (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``RUNAWAY BRIDE,'' starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.
Directed by Garry Marshall (PG, 110 minutes). When the stars and
director first collaborated, on ``Pretty Woman,'' Ms. Roberts was
cast as an adorable Los Angeles streetwalker. Nine years later,
she's as far as she can get from Rodeo Drive, geographically and
otherwise. Playing the stern proprietor of a small-town Maryland
hardware store, she takes an awfully long while to slip from
scowling into flirtatious romantic-comedy mode. And when the sparks
start flying between her character and Gere's likably stubborn
newspaper columnist, they fly on cue. Funny minor characters and
one-liners offset the not-so-pretty story of a woman who habitually
jilts her men (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTH SENSE,'' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel
Osment. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107
minutes). What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled
8-year-old boy ( Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the
child psychologist (Willis) determined to cure him, eventually
turns into New Age mush (think ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Simon
Birch''). When you trace the plot backward after its big secret is
revealed, the story doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual
smirking one-note performance. What empathy the movie generates
comes from Osment's intense portrayal of the tormented child
(Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``TEACHING MRS. TINGLE,'' starring Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes,
Marisa Coughlan and Barry Watson. Written and directed by Kevin
Williamson (PG-13, 93 minutes). Three teen-agers dislike their
nasty history teacher, so they go to her house, tie her to her bed
and hold her hostage. Surely this had a more honest viciousness
when it was first written by Williamson, who went on to write the
``Scream'' movies, ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer,'' but it has been absurdly soft-pedaled into a kinder,
gentler version. Retitled ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' from ``Killing
Mrs. Tingle,'' and no doubt with its ending changed accordingly, it
works overtime trying to make the high schoolers sympathetic. As
the teacher, Ms. Mirren is much too good for this material
(Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE 13TH WARRIOR,'' starring Antonio Banderas and Omar Sharif.
Directed by John McTiernan (R, 103 minutes). Set in the 10th
century and adapted from a novel by Michael Crichton, this
grunting, sweating, blood-gushing medieval answer to professional
wrestling is inspired by Ahmed Ibn Fadhlan's historical account of
his adventures in Central Asia. Banderas plays an exiled Persian
poet who hooks up with a group of Norse warriors to do battle with
an evil tribe of flesh-eaters. The screenplay is monosyllabic, but
the action scenes, which take you into the thick of battle, are
excitingly photographed. A charging score by Jerry Goldsmith helps
ennoble the grisly derring-do (Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR,'' starring Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo
and Denis Leary. Directed by John McTiernan (R, 114 minutes). It
was the stars, Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen, who made this story
sexy the first time around; now it's the showy big-ticket
accouterments. Brosnan and Ms. Russo seem to share the most
heartfelt moment in this halfhearted romance when they jointly go
shopping. McTiernan is better known for the action in his ``Die
Hard'' and other movies than for the tender moments therein. So the
museum heists here are more convincing and exciting than the scenes
of carefully staged amour (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``TRICK,'' starring Christian Campbell and John Paul Pitoc.
Directed by Jim Fall (R, 90 minutes). This engaging, tenderhearted
boy-meets-boy story features two handsome, doe-eyed actors in the
story of a romantic one-night stand. As in the Doris Day-era sex
comedies that are recalled here, the story is filled with obstacles
to the affair, the most noxious of them Tori Spelling in the role
of an incorrigible nuisance. Fall gives a small-town coziness to
his film's Greenwich Village settings and makes this a quaintly
likable date movie for audiences of any persuasion (Maslin).

<P>
   Sometimes the dippiest notions have the greatest potential.
``Yellow Submarine,'' the animated Beatles film that has just been
thoroughly refurbished for its video release and is having a
limited theater run beginning this week, started life as a vague
idea for a song that occurred to Paul McCartney as he was falling
asleep one night in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   In the light of day, McCartney decided that his song _ something
about everyone living in a yellow submarine _ would make a cheerful
children's tune that Ringo Starr could sing on ``Revolver,'' the
album the group was then recording.
</P>
<P>
   When McCartney brought the song into the studio that May, Starr
and the others ran with it, taking six hours to record the basic
instrumental and vocal tracks and 12 more to overdub party noises,
funny voices, brass band music and an array of maritime sound
effects that included blowing bubbles and dragging chains across a
metal tub filled with water.
</P>
<P>
   Released as a single _ the only Beatles single on which Starr is
the lead vocalist _ the song went quickly to No. 1. Within weeks of
its appearance, Al Brodax, a cartoon producer at King Features in
New York, flew to London to try to persuade the group that ``Yellow
Submarine'' could be the basis of an animated film.
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles resisted the idea, having seen and loathed the
``Beatles Cartoons'' that Brodax had been producing since 1964 and
that were running on Saturday mornings on American television.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Beatles owed United Artists a film, but had lost
interest in acting after ``A Hard Day's Night'' and ``Help!'' Here
was a project they could keep at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   They were required to provide only four new songs; the others in
the film would be drawn from the ``Rubber Soul,'' ``Revolver'' and
``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' albums, the last of which
was released just as work on the film was getting under way. They
would appear in the film in the flesh only briefly, at the end.
They refused to dub the voices, and only McCartney bothered to read
any of the scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all that, they liked ``Yellow Submarine'' when it was
released in the summer of 1968. Its story appealed to the naive
sensibility of the period, bounded by ``Sgt. Pepper'' in 1967 and
the Woodstock festival in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In it, the Beatles sail off in a magical yellow submarine with
the elderly Young Fred and save the peaceful citizens of Pepperland
from an attack by the vicious Blue Meanies. The Beatles' weapon is
music, specifically ``All You Need Is Love,'' the group's anthemic
1967 hit.
</P>
<P>
   The look of the film appealed to them as well. With its bright
colors, its pioneering blend of photography and cartoon imagery and
its menagerie of exotic sea monsters, Blue Meanies, Apple Bonkers,
Snapping Turks and Flying Gloves, the movie was a compendium of the
psychedelic Pop Art that was flourishing at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Since its original release, though, ``Yellow Submarine'' has
been hard to find. It turned up occasionally on college campuses in
the 1970s, and it was shown on television a few times, mostly late
at night. A video version was released by MGM/UA in 1987, but it
was quickly pulled off the market because of an ownership dispute
that involved Apple (the Beatles' company), King Features and
MGM/UA.
</P>
<P>
   Now the legal questions are settled, and ``Yellow Submarine'' is
back with a vengeance. And it is not quite the film you may
remember. The original mono soundtrack has been replaced with
six-channel Surround Sound using a system called Dolby 5.1, and
includes newly remixed versions of the Beatles' songs. It also
includes the scene in which the Beatles sing ``Hey Bulldog,'' a
sequence that was deleted after the earliest screenings to quicken
the pace of the film's final reel.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape (in stereo) and the DVD (a digital video disk in
Dolby 5.1, with a documentary and other extras) are to be released
on Tuesday, as is a compact disk, ``Yellow Submarine Songtrack''
(Capitol), with the new mixes of the 15 songs heard in the film.
Dozens of tie-in items, from cookie jars and tea sets to action
figures and inflatable chairs, have already hit the market. And the
U.S. Postal Service is issuing a ``Yellow Submarine'' stamp.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of renovating ``Yellow Submarine'' occurred to Bruce
Markoe, the vice president of feature postproduction at MGM/UA, in
1995, when he played the film for his 5-year-old daughter. She
loved it, Markoe said; but as a more critical viewer, he was
disappointed that the colors were not as dazzling as he remembered
them and that the soundtrack was flat by modern standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `We have something valuable here, something that a
couple of generations haven't seen,''' he said. ``I also thought
that this was a film that cried out for upgrading with today's
technology. So I went to John Calley, who was the president of the
company at the time, and pitched him the idea of renovating the
film for rerelease.''
</P>
<P>
   Markoe was told he could proceed once the legal problems were
settled. That took a year. It took nearly as long for Markoe to get
Apple to agree to allow the Beatles' music to be remixed for
Surround Sound from the master tapes.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as the '60s recordings by the Byrds, the Who,
the Kinks and other bands have been remixed and remastered to take
new technologies into account, the Beatles have generally insisted
that their music be left alone. In his meetings with Neil Aspinall,
the chief executive at Apple, Markoe argued that simply replacing
the mono recordings on the soundtrack with the stereo versions
available on CD was not the best option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Neil that audiences are used to 5.1 digital sound in
the movies now,'' Markoe said, ``and that while we could spread out
the stereo mixes for 5.1, it would compromise the recordings. I
think that was the key, because the Beatles never liked to settle
for compromises. Neil said we could go ahead, with the
understanding that if the Beatles didn't approve the new mixes, we
couldn't use them.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The audio remixing got under way in October 1997 with Peter
Cobbin, a staff engineer at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London, at
the remixing desk. Cobbin's task was inherently contradictory: the
songs had to sound much as they originally did, yet the new mixes
had to take advantage of the six-channel capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very detailed kind of attention was needed to make sure that
everything was put back the same,'' Cobbin said of his mixes. ``As
you're probably aware, there are many takes of a song, and even
within the take that was used for the record, there may be guitar
solos or vocal harmonies that were not used. So a lot of time was
spent seeing that the right elements were used.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters further was the recording technique that
the Beatles used between 1965 and 1968, when the songs on the
``Yellow Submarine'' soundtrack were recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Using the four-track equipment available at the time, the
Beatles tended to fill all the four tracks with the basic skeleton
of a song _ drums, bass and guitar, for example _ and then copy
them on to a single track on a second reel of tape. They would then
add vocals, solos and other embellishments on the remaining three
tracks. When their ideas grew more complicated, they repeated this
process until they had filled the tracks on three or four tapes.
</P>
<P>
   There were trade-offs in this method: once the earliest tracks
were mixed, copied and augmented, there was no way to reconsider
the balances. And every time a copy was made, the sound quality was
degraded.
</P>
<P>
   But EMI kept all of its Beatles session tapes, and using digital
multitracking equipment, Cobbin was able to transfer the unmixed
component tracks into a computer and remix them with a freedom that
the Beatles and their producer, George Martin, did not have in the
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleanor Rigby,'' heard early in the film, is one of the
simpler examples of what Cobbin was able to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was recorded with a string octet, laid out in a fairly
traditional manner,'' he said. ``Because the strings were recorded
on all four tracks, they had to be bounced to mono for Paul to do
his vocals. I had the four string tracks, so I could pan them the
way the players were seated. And then, when you use the rear
speakers for ambience, you do get the feeling that you're inside
the stereo image, much more than if you have the strings coming out
of one speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Cobbin's remixes have a revelatory freshness that even
Beatles purists may find surprising. The vocal harmonies that open
``Nowhere Man,'' for example, now envelop the listener; on the
original stereo recording, the vocals were on one channel and the
instruments on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The delicate percussion in ``All Together Now,'' buried in the
original recording, has a presence that gives the song a more
complex, tactile texture. And ``Only a Northern Song,'' never
before released in stereo, has become a kaleidoscopic welter of
sound.
</P>
<P>
   The mixes passed the Beatles' audition, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, it was great,'' Starr said of the 1998 session at which he
and McCartney heard the Surround Sound mixes for the first time.
``We're listening and saying, `What is THAT?' Because you hear all
these sounds that we made in the studio, but they all got buried.
It's so lively.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cobbin was working on the songs in London, Ted Hall, at
Pacific Ocean Post (POP) Sound, and Greg Kimble, at POP Video, both
in Santa Monica, Calif., revamped other elements of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's domain was the rest of the soundtrack _ dialogue, sound
effects and Martin's orchestral score. A suite from Martin's score
had been included on the original ``Yellow Submarine'' soundtrack
album and where possible, Hall replaced the mono soundtrack
recording with the album version, which is in stereo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stereo recording was not from the original scoring date
for the film,'' Hall said. ``He rerecorded it for the album several
months later, so the arrangements are a little different, and a lot
of the music wasn't included. But it sounded good and I wanted to
use it. That meant that there are stretches that are eight bars in
stereo and eight bars in mono. The challenge was to make it
seamless.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall also removed clicks, pops, hiss and other noises from the
soundtrack. He assembled an effects library by recording each of
the film's roughly 300 sound effects separately, and enhancing some
by adding bass, reverberation or other forms of processing. A few
touch ups were necessary. In one scene, the Beatles are seen
applauding, but there was no applause on the original soundtrack.
Hall and Markoe recorded some themselves. Hall also supplied a burp
for one of the Blue Meanies.
</P>
<P>
   When he transferred the effects to the new soundtrack, the
Surround Sound system allowed him to think spatially: now when the
Flying Glove menaces the people of Pepperland, it can be heard
flying around the theater, and the Blue Meanies' missiles seem to
move across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Kimble worked on the film itself. Markoe had found an original
negative for all five reels of the film, and an interpositive _ an
intermediate copy made from the negative _ of the last three reels
only. The interpositive was in good enough shape to use, after
substantial cleaning and color correcting.
</P>
<P>
   But a new interpositive had to be made for the first two reels,
which account for 40 of the film's 90 minutes. Before doing that,
the negative, which Kimble described as ``dirty, beat up and
scratched,'' had to be scanned into the computer _ a process that
took 340 hours _ and restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were tears to repair, crooked splices to fix and the
colors had faded at different rates over the years,'' Kimble said.
``Reds had become brown, whites had yellowed. In the opening
titles, there are white letterings on a black background, but the
black had become cyan. The color had to be corrected digitally.
Other problems _ frames that someone had forgotten to color, or
where there was dirt or a scratch _ had to be painted by hand. We
went through the film frame by frame.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Creating a new print took about six months, and by the time the
film and its soundtrack were reconciled, MGM/UA had spent about
$600,000, more than double Markoe's original budget.
</P>
<P>
   As complicated as the renovation was, it was the very picture of
organization compared with the chaotic original production. With
the Beatles uninterested in it, and their manager, Brian Epstein,
behaving increasingly erratically in the final months of his life
(he died in August 1967), the film was a frustrating endeavor from
the start.
</P>
<P>
   Brodax, discussing the early scripts, said: ``I flew to London
with a stack of scripts, each one with a different color cover.
First I met with Brian, and he said, `I haven't read them yet; stay
in your hotel and I'll choose one.' Five days later, I hadn't left
my hotel room and I was furious. When I finally saw him again, he
picked up the first treatment and said, `I don't like this _ it's
purple,' and threw it on the floor. The next one _ `I don't like
this, it's orange.' Then he gets to one in a green cover, which was
written by Joseph Heller, and that one he threw away, too. So I
said, `Brian, that's by Joe Heller.' He said, `I don't care who
it's by, I don't like green.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brodax returned to New York and commissioned a new script from
Lee Minoff, a 29-year-old playwright who had worked as an assistant
to director Stanley Kubrick on ``Dr. Strangelove'' and whose play
``Come Live With Me'' had just had a brief run on Broadway.
Minoff's script was quite different from the final version of the
film: he had the Beatles visit a land where submarine-people were
menaced by a large monster that used them to pick its teeth.
</P>
<P>
   That script did, however, include a few characters that survived
to the final cut _ most notably Jeremy Boob and Fred _ and it
suggests the techniques of combining film and photographs that were
adopted by the animators at TV Cartoons in London, where the film
was made.
</P>
<P>
   Other writers were later brought in as script doctors. One was
Erich Segal, then a classics professor at Yale and later the author
of ``Love Story.'' Another was Roger McGough, a Liverpool writer
and musician who later became a well-known poet. He contributed
much of the Beatles' pun-filled dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Brodax withheld the script from the production team at TV
Cartoons. He said he did this to encourage competition between the
two animation directors, Bob Balser and Jack Stokes.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Hieronimus, a broadcaster at WCBM in Baltimore and the
author of the forthcoming ``It Was All In the Mind: The Co-Creation
of Yellow Submarine,'' interviewed nearly 40 members of the
creative team, and discovered that Brodax's strategy backfired.
Lacking a script, Balser, Stokes and Heinz Edelmann, the chief
designer, contributed their own plot elements.
</P>
<P>
   For all the film's imagery of all-conquering peace and love, its
behind-the-scenes creation was a battlefield on which all kinds of
hostilities emerged. Minoff, who is now a psychotherapist, said
that the hyperintellectual Jeremy Boob was meant as a swipe at
Jonathan Miller, who had directed his play.
</P>
<P>
   One of the animators told Hieronimus that the Chief Blue Meanie
has big, round Mickey Mouse-style ears because Edelmann disliked
Disney animation; another said the character was patterned after
Brodax, whom the team regarded as an adversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, this was all done over 30 years ago, and myths
grow,'' Brodax said, dismissing talk of strained relations with the
TV Cartoons staff. ``It's like `Rashomon.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brodax is writing his own book, ``Up Periscope Yellow.'' Neither
his book nor Hieronimus' will be out in time to benefit from the
reissue of the film. But memorabilia manufacturers _ and Apple's
licensing department _ have been quick off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items for sale, or due soon, are ties and boxer
shorts, cigarette lighters, Christmas tree ornaments and several
lines of T-shirts, comic books and posters. The original ``Yellow
Submarine'' was one of the first films to generate a tie-in
industry, and some of the items sold in 1968 are now pricey
collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original `Yellow Submarine' wristwatch and alarm clock are
worth about $2,000 each,'' said Jeff Augsburger, the author, with
Rick Rann and Marty Eck, of the authoritative ``Beatles Memorabilia
Price Guide.'' He added that Blue Meanie Halloween costumes in
their original box are worth $900. But the prize rarity is a set of
Goebel porcelain figurines, which go for as much as $10,000 a set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan to collect the new stuff,'' said Augsburger, who
collects only 1960s items. ``But I've been admiring it. They've
come up with lots of interesting things, very few of which
replicate the original items.''
</P>
<P>
   Will they be worth small fortunes in a few decades. ``It's hard
to tell,'' Augsburger said. ``There's a different attitude now than
in the '60s. Back then you bought something, you played with it, it
broke, and your mom threw it away. So the pieces that have come
down in near-mint condition are worth a lot. Now people think these
things might have some value, so they protect them. In 30 years,
everyone will pull out their `Yellow Submarine' items in mint
condition, and we'll see then if anyone wants them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow Submarine'' is having a limited theatrical release.
This is because film reissues typically draw small audiences and
because the video version is due next week, said Larry Gleason, a
spokesman for MGM/UA's distribution arm. Usually the company
prefers to show a film exclusively in a theater for four or five
months.
</P>
<P>
   But unless you have a DVD player with Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound,
the only way to hear the vivid new six-channel mixes of some
Beatles favorites _ including ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band,'' ``Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,'' ``Nowhere Man'' and
``All You Need Is Love'' _ is in a suitably equipped theater.
</P>
<P>
   In New York the film opens Friday and runs through next Friday..
Elsewhere around the country, the film will be shown through
Wednesday at the Castro in San Francisco; through Thursday at the
Music Box in Chicago, the Egyptian in Seattle and the Hillcrest in
San Diego, and through next Friday at the Esquire in Denver.

BROWNS' COUCH NO BABE IN ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects name of Couch's qb coach to Hatcher.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Driving to and from work at Leslie County High
School in Hyden, Ky. _ early in the morning or late at night,
spring through winter; it made no difference _ Tim Koogler would
pass the two-story house and see the little boy out there on the
front lawn. The junior varsity head coach and varsity assistant
began to take the sight for granted, as if the kid were part of the
shrubbery.
</P>
<P>
   He was always on the 75-foot expanse of grass, it seemed, always
throwing a football. Often he'd be playing catch with his big
brother, but a human target wasn't a necessity. Illuminated in the
darkness by the lights his father had installed, he'd be out there
alone, improvising until bedtime, drilling passes to the utility
pole 30 yards away near the roadway that served as his makeshift
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing changed about the scene over the years, Koogler
noticed. Like the shrubs, the kid kept growing, and so did his
proficiency and his reputation and eventually his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   All of them, in fact, have reached unimaginable proportions for
Tim Couch _ former high school legend, recent college
program-saver, and current National Football League poster boy as
the top pick in the 1999 draft.
</P>
<P>
   In their latest incarnation, the expansion Cleveland Browns
decided to build their second coming around Couch, choosing the
6-foot-5-inch, 225-pound junior quarterback from the University of
Kentucky with the No. 1 selection in April and investing in him a
$12.5 million signing bonus and a seven-year contract that could
top out at $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   They've made him rich, but not the starter. When the Browns open
the season against the Pittsburgh Steelers Sept. 12, Couch will be
the understudy to journeyman Ty Detmer. Unlike previously anointed
No. 1 saviors such as John Elway and Peyton Manning, who were
thrown immediately into the fire and the fanfare, Couch will be
nurtured slowly, cultivated like one of those shrubs in his front
yard. That's been the plan right along, emphasizes coach Chris
Palmer, the former Boston University boss and Patriots assistant
who has tutored, among others, Pro Bowlers Drew Bledsoe and Mark
Brunell. The Browns experienced no dissatisfaction when they
unwrapped their prize package. Quite the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's developed very, very nicely,'' says Palmer. ``He's done
everything we've asked. And he's used to the pressure. He carried
Kentucky. He turned around Kentucky's program and now he has a
chance to turn ours around.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually. And that makes sense to Couch, an unassuming sort
who with a few blond curls could pass for Larry Bird's twin and
whose college quarterback coach, Chris Hatcher, calls him ``just a
big ol' country boy from the hills of Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a rookie quarterback,'' says Couch. ``It's going to take
time. I've got a long way to go. I feel really comfortable. It's
just a matter of getting repetitions. I know what I'm doing in
practice. I've just got to learn the reads during games. I think
I'm capable of playing really well. It's just a matter of
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence was really mixed in the exhibition season, he
learned. Couch was superb in two relief appearances, rallying the
Browns to victory in their Hall of Fame Game opener, a 20-17
decision over the Cowboys (11 for 17, 137 yards, 1 touchdown), and
against the Bears in a 35-24 shootout (10 for 14, 128 yards, 1 TD).
But like the rest of the team, he was a dud in a 30-3 debacle at
Tampa (5 for 12, 27 yards). He was decidedly indifferent in his
lone start, a 24-17 loss to the Vikings that christened Cleveland
Browns Stadium (8 for 17, 77 yards). And in Thursday's finale, a
30-17 loss to the Eagles, Couch (5 for 9, 41 yards) was outplayed
by fellow first-round pick Donovan McNabb of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Disregarding the numbers, he made an immediate impression on his
teammates, especially one with a rather lofty frame of reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first chance he got to play,'' recalls Dave Wohlabaugh,
Bledsoe's center with the Patriots before joining Cleveland, ``he
seemed really poised. I was shocked. He wasn't stuttering or
anything in the huddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because Couch has been preparing for this moment
almost since the cradle. Growing up in Hyden, a hamlet of 350 in
Kentucky's southeastern hills that once was a coal mining center
but whose principal employer now is the Board of Education, he
realized that his recreational opportunities were limited, if not
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go through town right now,'' says Onzie Feltner, who
began coaching Couch in the second grade at Hyden Elementary
School, ``there's probably a bunch of kids sitting in the parking
lot talking and watching the traffic go by.''
</P>
<P>
   For more interesting diversions, you'd have to drive to Perry
County, 20 miles away, to take in a movie or pump quarters into an
arcade. Or you could opt for the type of home entertainment Couch
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really have anything to do except throw a ball,'' he
says. ``There was nothing else to occupy my time. I've always seen
myself as an NFL quarterback. I've wanted to be one ever since I
can remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what he first wanted to be was just like his brother.
Four and a half years older, Greg was Tim's idol and throwing
partner from the beginning. And since Greg was a quarterback, Tim
became one, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we played football,'' recalls Greg, who now helps
manage his brother's career, ``we'd be on opposite teams so we
could both be quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim was Greg's rival in pickup games but his successor in
organized football. ``He was always one team behind me,'' says
Greg. ``He'd take over when I left.''
</P>
<P>
   That pattern began under Feltner. Tim would tag along with Greg
to practice and play along the sidelines with a bunch of other
little brothers. When his time came to don the uniform, Feltner
utilized Tim at every backfield position so he could familiarize
himself with each assignment. But there was no doubt about his
permanent position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had a strong arm,'' says Feltner. ``It seemed like
even at the start, he'd throw with his whole body; a lot of people
just throw with their arm. I guess you could call him a
tailback-quarterback. If we had to pass the ball, the quarterback
would lateral to him and he'd throw on a rollout or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   By sixth grade, you could call Tim strictly a
quarterback-quarterback, and he's been there ever since. Even then,
he seemed to be aiming toward the horizon. ``You could always tell
he had something in mind down the road,'' says Feltner.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he took over the huddle for Koogler's JVs, ``real
uncommon for a seventh- or eighth-grader,'' says the coach. But
there was no mistaking he belonged. Koogler once saw a Couch pass
leave a gouge the length of his receiver's hand between the two
middle fingers. For laughs, he'd stand at the 50-yard line and bet
Koogler a Gatorade that he could hit the goalpost with a pass.
Couch never went thirsty.
</P>
<P>
   And Leslie County High feasted. During Couch's tenure, the
stadium swelled with 7,000 fans _ 20 times the town's population _
on football Fridays as he led the team to the state semifinals as a
junior and senior. Along the way, he set national high school
records for TD passes, yardage, completions, and completion
percentage, in the process setting off a recruiting hysteria. But
he created doubts about his sanity by turning down Florida State
and Tennessee and Penn State to attend Kentucky, which was riding
the momentum of a typical 1-10 season. ``It was loyalty or
something, I guess,'' says Koogler, now the head high school coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my home state school,'' explains Couch. ``I grew up
wanting to play there. I watched them as a kid. It seemed like the
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not during his freshman year, when he struggled in coach Bill
Curry's option offense, which was catastrophically ill-suited to
Couch's talents. But he flourished after Hal Mumme took over the
Wildcats in his sophomore season and brought in Hatchers as
quarterback tutor.
</P>
<P>
   Hatchers arrived from Central Florida, where he'd worked with a
kid by the name of Daunte Culpepper, Minnesota's top draft choice
last spring. ``Culpepper can throw the ball a little farther,''
says Hatchers. ``But Couch can throw more types of passes. And he
throws the most catchable ball I've ever seen. He's the Greg Maddux
of football. People don't understand: Why throw your fastball if
you can win with your changeup?''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats' fortunes changed up in the next two years, capped
by last season's 7-5 record that culminated in an Outback Bowl
berth. Operating Mumme's and Hatchers's West Coast offense, Couch
became a sizzling commodity, setting seven NCAA records, earning
All-America honors, finishing as a Heisman Trophy finalist _ and
emerging as a prime candidate to go No. 1 in the draft if he chose
to leave school early.
</P>
<P>
   His dedication never was in doubt. A four-month season still
wasn't enough. During the winter, Tim would call Greg, who was
finishing up his quarterbacking career at Eastern Kentucky, and
have his brother bring some teammates 20 minutes down the road to
Lexington for a little seven-on-seven session with the Wildcats.
``He's going to play football until he can't walk,'' says Hatchers.
``That's how much he loves the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The one reservation about Couch concerned arm strength, and
Hatchers considers that a misconception because Kentucky's scheme
emphasized throwing underneath the coverage. ``A lot of guys can
throw 80 or 90 yards,'' says Hatchers. ``But not many can throw the
`out' route? Our old offensive coordinator, Mike Leach, said it
best: `I got eight or nine linemen who can throw the ball farther
than Couch. Would you want to draft them No. 1?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns eventually provided the answer, though they wanted to
make sure before committing the reborn franchise's cornerstone
pick. ``The first workout he had for us,'' says Cleveland
quarterback coach John Hufnagel, ``he had good arm strength, but
there were still some questions. The second workout, he'd answered
all the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's just one left: Can Couch dominate at this level as
he has since grammar school? Make that two: Is he jaded by the
whole process after all these years?
</P>
<P>
   ``It never grows old,'' he says, eyes sparkling. ``You always
set the challenge to get to the top after starting at the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal history says he'll do it. Just ask that utility pole.

   Sexy Star as Comic Muse
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Sharon Stone received the best reviews of her career
for her role in the Albert Brooks comedy ``The Muse.'' And the
actress, who's now suddenly receiving offers to appear in comedies,
still can't quite believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really owe it to Albert, who takes a woman like me, who
plays out-there kind of dramatic roles, and puts her in a comedy,''
Ms. Stone said. ``There was a kind of generosity there that few
people have.''
</P>
<P>
   Has she appeared in a comedy before? ``Well, I thought `Basic
Instinct' was a riot, but that's just me,'' said Ms. Stone,
referring to the Paul Verhoeven blockbuster that made her a sexy
star.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Stone's earliest films was an underappreciated Nancy
Meyers-Charles Shyer comedy, ``Irreconcilable Differences'' (1984),
about a Hollywood couple who lose their way on the path to success.
But most of Ms. Stone's career, which has had a few stumbles,
includes action movies like ``Total Recall'' and ``The
Specialist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Muse,'' which has performed modestly at the box office, is
a satire about Hollywood in which the Brooks character plays a
screenwriter who has been told by sleazy studio executive that he's
lost his edge. Desperate, he's told by a friend about a Beverly
Hills muse. In Greek mythology, the Muses were the nine daughters
of Zeus, each responsible for a different facet of creativity.
</P>
<P>
   The show-biz muse, as played by Ms. Stone, repairs people's
creative and personal lives but is also quite a diva _ demanding
gifts from Tiffany's and suites at the Four Seasons Hotel in
Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Critics were generally dazzled by Ms. Stone as the Muse. Janet
Maslin of The New York Times called her performance ``delectable.''
And Kenneth Turan, in The Los Angeles Times, said she proved to be
``a wonderful choice.'' He added, ``Her sure-handed, gleeful work
in `The Muse' plays well against Brooks' anxiety and underlines her
own real gift for confident verbal humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone said that Brooks had telephoned her and told her the
story of ``The Muse,'' and that she had accepted the part without
even reading the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like he trusted me, and that's the key,'' she said.
``He told me to bring my ideas and dreams to work. Less confident
and less intelligent directors aren't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone has changed her life considerably in the last few
years, after her marriage to Phil Bronstein, executive editor of
The San Francisco Examiner. Bronstein is recovering from
angioplasty, and Ms. Stone said she was trying to stay in San
Francisco to move into a new home and stay close to her husband,
who's back at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've moved my city of residency from L.A. to San Francisco,
and I'm spending time with Phil and I'm going to see what
happens,'' she said. ``It's all very good. I'm enjoying what I
have. I've gotten these amazing reviews. I'm reading scripts. And I
feel there's a whole new avenue open to me in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone has two films that she's set to work on: ``Beautiful
Joe,'' a comedy with Billy Connolly, and ``Simpatico,'' an
adaptation of a Sam Shepard drama that will also star Nick Nolte,
Jeff Bridges and Albert Finney.
</P>
<P>
   At 41, Ms. Stone said that the roles were still coming and that
she had no problem playing ``moms or teachers or lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   She said: ``I also have a life, a great life, a great husband. I
love San Francisco. You meet people and they're map makers and
bookbinders and Silicon Valley start-up computer founders and, to
be honest, it's delightful not to just discuss movies, which you do
in L.A.'' She added, ``I love movies, but it gets a big narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she ever worry about roles drying up?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' she said. ``I have enough of a body of work. If
people are looking for someone like me, well, I'm their gal.''

   Retro Is a Stretch
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schrader is flying to the Toronto Film Festival this
weekend in a hopeful, and nervous, mood. The screenwriter of ``Taxi
Driver'' and ``Raging Bull,'' as well as the director of ``American
Gigolo'' and ``Affliction,'' plans to show his newest movie,
``Forever Mine'' on Sunday night. And he hopes that a film company
will buy and distribute the movie.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Schrader movie unusual is that it's a far cry
from the dark and melancholy dramas that have stamped the career of
the 53-year-old filmmaker. The movie stars Joseph Fiennes, Ray
Liotta and Gretchen Mol. It is both a thriller and a sultry
romantic ode to Hollywood movies of the 1940s and 1950s, those lush
and stylish melodramas, made by directors like Douglas Sirk and
Nicholas Ray, that starred actresses like Dorothy Malone and Lana
Turner and actors like Tyrone Power and Rock Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   The movie involves a love triangle and murder plot over a period
of 14 years, set on the pink beaches of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader has been trying to get the project off the ground for
more than a decade. Various studios have owned the script, and then
dropped it. And then Schrader found a financier, Damita Nikapota, a
Sri Lankan businessman living in London who helped pull the $20
million package together.
</P>
<P>
   In David Thomson's Biographical Dictionary of Film, Schrader is
termed a director who ``has placed himself on the edge of the
mainstream.'' Thomson wrote: ``He understands commerce very well;
he could explain how to make hits. But some perverse, rugged
integrity has left his work increasingly hermetic and narrow in its
range.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader's new film is perhaps an effort to break loose of that
range. The director-writer said he always yearned to make ``a
really grand, romantic love melodrama that harks back to the '40s
and '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Those kinds of meloddramas were once the life's
blood of movies. But they became kind of stigmatized and extinct.
We've moved to a very cynical and ironic deconstructive age. And
these were films that wore their hearts on their sleeves. They're
very unfashionable now. In fact they're so unfashionable it's one
of the reasons I wanted to go back to them. Personally, I think
we've run aground of this deconstructive, ironic style.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, who left Los Angeles for New York in the 1980s, lives
mostly in Chappaqua, N.Y., now because of the good school system
for his two children, Holly, 15, and Sam, 12. Schrader and his
wife, Mary Beth Hurt, the actress, also keep an apartment on
Riverside Drive in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader recently reteamed with his friend Martin Scorsese and
wrote the screenplay for a film of the Joe Connelly novel,
``Bringing Out the Dead,'' about ambulance drivers dealing with the
underbelly of New York. The film, which stars Nicolas Cage, opens
on Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader said he realized that his leap into old-fashioned
romantic melodrama will surprise, if not shock, critics because of
his reputation as a filmmaker with a bleak sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I should change my screen name to something like
`Brittany Cartledge,' something romantic,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   But Schrader said he believed that moviegoers were ready for a
return to the lush-style films of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sort of backlash now against irony and cynicism and
deconstruction,'' he said. ``It just feeds on itself. It becomes
less and less about the world, and more and more about itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he nervous about showing the film for the first time to
distributors?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've developed a kind of steel stomach over the years,'' he
said. ``But that's not enough to protect me from a situation like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapper's New Role
</P>
<P>
   As one of rap's longest-running stars _ 15 years, and more than
20 million CD's sold _ LL Cool J has also emerged as one of the
busiest actors in films. The rapper, whose real name is James Todd
Smith, has top roles in two current films, as an evil millionaire
in ``In Too Deep,'' and as the cheerful chef on a shark-fighting
expedition in ``Deep Blue Sea.'' (Preview audiences found him so
likable in that role that instead of being eaten by the shark as
originally planned, his character was saved at the end and someone
else was eaten.)
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old entertainer, who is also appearing soon in ``Any
Given Sunday,'' a football drama directed by Oliver Stone and
starring Al Pacino, said that, in pursuing a film career, he had
studied the work and choices of his favorite actors: Pacino, Robert
Duvall, Morgan Freeman, Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the craft of acting,'' said LL Cool J, who grew up
in Queens, N.Y., and lives on Long Island. ``I try to study
diligently and pay close attention to what's going and really do
good work and deliver what the director wants.'' He added: ``What I
like about acting is simple: I get to play different lives.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last spring Paul Kellogg, the general and artistic
director of the New York City Opera, was in the managerial
doldrums. He was approaching the end of his third season with the
company and by most measures had made striking progress in carrying
out his vision. So what was the matter?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he was grappling with the long-standing
acoustical problems of the New York State Theater. Despite some
structural alterations to the auditorium for the purpose of
improving the acoustics, which Kellogg oversaw in the summer of
1996, the theater remained a dry environment for the singing voice.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg recently announced a bold though controversial plan to
deal with the acoustical shortcomings of the hall by installing a
sophisticated electronic sound enhancement system. That system is
now in place and ready for Saturday's opening night performance of
Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the spring, Kellogg faced a more immediate problem: a
steep drop in audience attendance. Ticket sales for the fall season
had been very encouraging. But March and April saw a dip, which was
worrisome and frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Kellogg decided to keep the long view about the
falloff in attendance. ``It generally takes three years for a shift
in artistic direction to show itself at the box office,'' he said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it worked out. As of now, ticket sales at City Opera
are booming, a greatly relieved Kellogg reported. So far, some $7
million in subscriptions have been sold, a $1 million increase over
this point last season.
</P>
<P>
   And, interestingly, the unusual repertory that City Opera is
known for is doing particularly well. The four performances of
``Central Park,'' the trilogy of one-act operas that received its
world premiere this summer at City Opera's sister company,
Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, are almost sold out. Rameau's
little-known ``Platee,'' a production directed by Mark Morris with
costumes and sets by Isaac Mizrahi, is ``selling wonderfully,''
Kellogg said, as is Handel's ``Ariodante.'' As of now, the seven
performances of Rossini's ``Viaggio a Reims'' are selling 16
percent better than the eight performances of Puccini's ``Boheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his predecessors, Kellogg believes that the greater New
York City area can support two major opera companies. But he
realizes that to thrive City Opera must distinguish itself from the
Metropolitan Opera, its neighbor in Lincoln Center. The company
cannot be perceived solely as a lesser Met.
</P>
<P>
   The best way for City Opera to fashion a strong identity,
Kellogg knows, is by offering unusual repertory. New works have
been important to the company, like Hugo Weisgall's gripping
``Esther,'' given its premiere in 1994, and Tobias Picker's
``Emmeline,'' introduced in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Neglected operas have also been championed by the company,
particularly 20th-century American works that have yet to find
their place in the canon, like Carlisle Floyd's ``Of Mice and
Men,'' a critical and audience triumph at City Opera last season.
And the company has had considerable success with Baroque and early
Classical period operas by composers like Handel and Gluck, works
mostly passed over by the Met as too intimate for its house of
nearly 4,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   But City Opera, like other companies, pays the bills through
standard repertory. This season, there will be 18 performances of
``Carmen.'' And if the company cannot present world-renowned
singers in the staples, as the Met is expected to, it can offer
audiences younger, emerging singers who look like the characters
they are portraying and make up in enthusiasm what they lack in
vocal charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg is fond of saying that his company's mission is to
present opera ``that is also great theater.'' In fact, City Opera
has been bolder than the Met at rethinking the audience favorites.
The current ``Madama Butterfly'' is a good example, a revelatory,
daringly abstract production by the director Mark Lamos that
rescues the work from the Japanese exotica and tired realism that
mar so many standard stagings.
</P>
<P>
   So things have been going fairly well during Kellogg's tenure,
it would seem. The company has had its share of ill-conceived
efforts. But, overall, critics have applauded City Opera's
imagination. Kellogg ``has taken to flooding us with new and
interesting things,'' wrote Bernard Holland, chief music critic of
The New York Times, last season. Audiences are getting noticeably
younger at the house, circumstantial evidence that City Opera is
attracting the newcomers coveted by orchestras and opera companies
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   If this pattern continues, those who care about the future of
the performing arts should take heart. Despite the reported graying
of audiences for classical music, the lack of arts education in
secondary schools and the sway of popular culture, Kellogg is
convinced that new audiences can be developed.
</P>
<P>
   But companies must understand, he says, that the potential
audience is not monolithic. There are people, mostly younger, who
are fairly new to opera and come to check out the name works. Every
time Kellogg sees a family with children or a college couple
dressed up on a date attending ``Tosca'' or ``The Magic Flute,'' he
knows he is reaching that segment of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the well-informed opera fans who are drawn to
unusual fare, like last season's productions of Jack Beeson's
``Lizzie Borden'' and Strauss' ``Intermezzo,'' and this season's
production of Virgil Thomson's ``Mother of Us All,'' with City
Opera's powerhouse prima donna Lauren Flanigan in the role of Susan
B. Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   There are also culturally curious people who may not know opera
but love theater. They, Kellogg believes, are just as likely to be
attracted to ``Of Mice and Men,'' because word spreads that the
production is powerful and affecting, as they would be to
``Carmen'' just because they have heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if there is a lid on the future growth of City Opera it
could be, in a sense, the ceiling of the New York State Theater
itself. Given its particular mission, the company is in the wrong
place. And the problem is not just the proximity of that opera
house with the big arching windows in front.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, when City Opera agreed to join the New York City
Ballet as occupants of the New York State Theater, the company
operated at the City Center of Music and Drama, on West 55th
Street, which was built in 1923 and was then in disrepair. Lincoln
Center offered a modern theater in a new arts complex that was
intended to be a model for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center did become a model for other cities. But now we
have learned better. Putting concert halls, opera houses and
theaters together in a fortress of culture with ample underground
parking may have seemed wise when cities were declining and arts
patrons lived in the suburbs. But cities have rebounded. Today,
ideally, a cultural institution should forge its own identity in
its own neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   All of Kellogg's predecessors have fantasized at times about
moving the company to a theater somewhere else in town. In 1991,
Christopher Keene, then the general manager, went to the press with
a plan to move City Opera to the New Amsterdam Theater on 42nd
Street as part of the redevelopment of that now-thriving block. The
plan obviously never materialized. Some past company officials
regret that it ever left City Center, which has since been
renovated.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the question of location are the specific
inadequacies of the State Theater as an opera house. The dry
acoustics and large size of 2,730 seats combine to make it an
exasperating space for the younger singers the company cultivates.
When you hear a fledgling tenor struggling to make an impact there
as Don Jose in ``Carmen,'' City Opera can seem like a company that
is exploiting rather than nurturing young artists. And Kellogg's
desire to present opera as a form of vivid theater is also
hampered.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing points this out better than comparing productions at
City Opera and Glimmerglass. When Kellogg was tapped for the City
Opera post, he retained his position as the longstanding artistic
director in the Cooperstown company. He envisioned a cooperative
relationship between the two under which new productions were
developed and introduced at Glimmerglass in summer festival
conditions that allowed for ample rehearsal time, then brought to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the plan has succeeded. Audiences here and there
have been treated to some memorable shared productions, like Lamos'
colorful, moving and ingenious staging of Britten's theatrically
cumbersome first opera, ``Paul Bunyan.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Glimmerglass performs in an ideal 900-seat theater with
excellent acoustics and inviting intimacy. Those who regularly
visit both companies tend to agree that much is lost when a new
production travels from Cooperstown's dream house to a problematic
theater three times the size in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This puts Kellogg's decision to experiment with a new sound
enhancement system in context. He felt he had to do something to
make the State Theater a more intimate and hospitable place for
opera, and an extensive renovation of the hall would be
prohibitively expensive and architecturally unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But in embracing an electronic sound system, no matter how
unlike traditional amplification its designers assert it is, the
company is starting down a slippery slope. Opera houses are among
the last bastions of natural sound. Will managers and talent scouts
be able to trust what they hear at City Opera? Will singers with
smallish voices grow dependent upon enhancement? Will audiences,
especially younger people who have grown up with amplified music
and are not as bothered by the idea as are traditional opera buffs,
start expecting it everywhere?
</P>
<P>
   Fears of such scenarios explains why even Beverly Sills, the
greatest star singer in the history of City Opera and a former
general manager, has said she hopes the electronic enhancement will
be a stopgap until the theater can be fully renovated.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg reports he has received relatively few letters of
protest about the new sound system, which he interprets as a sign
that his audience is willing to give it a chance. Still, one
suspects that even he must secretly yearn to pick up his company
and move to a smaller house, either a renovated older theater or a
new one. This is especially so now that his vision for the company
seems to be catching on with audiences, as ticket sales seem to
indicate.
</P>
<P>
   But imagine the company in a beautifully restored old theater in
Times Square. Or even a new theater of, say, 1,500 seats in
Chelsea, or northern Manhattan, or the far Upper West Side. That
would give City Opera an instantaneous and vital new identity. To
build a proper theater would probably cost at least $150 million.
In this age of almost obscene prosperity for the super-rich, there
are people who could write a check for that sum.
</P>
<P>
   For now, and probably for some time to come, Kellogg and his
audiences will have to make do with enhanced sound and its
attention-grabbing Lincoln Center neighbor.

BROADWAY'S FALL LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By JESSE MCKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is the year that fall came early.
</P>
<P>
   The signs were everywhere. On Broadway, the usually slow August
had two openings _ ``Kat and the Kings'' and ``Voices in the
Dark.'' But neither show impressed critics, who apparently hadn't
had enough time to get over the dyspepsia from last season's
lukewarm fare.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, producers gobbled up theaters as soon as closings
were announced. ``It's theater owners' nirvana,'' said Rocco
Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters. ``There's nothing left.
</P>
<P>
   By July, the fall schedule was mostly set, leaving would-be
transfers like the new musical ``Jane Eyre'' to hope for a vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, some things remain the same. Autumn falls, and hope
springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who work on these projects for years, it's natural
to think that you've found something that will attract new
audiences and create unique new experiences,'' said Jed Bernstein,
president of the League of American Theaters and Producers. ``You
have to. If they were rational about the risk, nobody would produce
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is plenty of reason for excitement. Fall will see
veterans like Carol Burnett (in ``Putting It Together'') and Lauren
Bacall (in ``Waiting in the Wings'') astride Broadway while
Christopher Walken (in ``The Dead,'' a musical) and Liev Schreiber
(as ``Hamlet'' at the Public) will be at home Off.
</P>
<P>
   Star power has found its way to Off Off Broadway too. Naked
Angels, the promising downtown troupe, will feature Fisher Stevens
and Annabella Sciorra in ``Shyster,'' while at the Wooster Group,
the avant-garde troupe based in SoHo, Willem Dafoe and Steve
Buscemi will share duties in ``North Atlantic,'' a 1983 play set on
an aircraft carrier.
</P>
<P>
   For those seeking a little suspense, there are plenty of
potential cliffhangers.
</P>
<P>
   THE MUSICALS
</P>
<P>
   After a season packed with straight plays, four musicals are
confirmed for Broadway this fall, with more aiming for the spring.
Let's begin with the kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday Night Fever,'' based on the 1977 disco epic, is
shaping up to be the season's 800-pound gorilla, with the earliest
opening, for a musical on Oct. 21, and the largest advance, $12
million and counting. Still, the burden of filling that pristine
white suit falls to James Carpinello, an almost unknown actor in
his Broadway debut.
</P>
<P>
   It is the perfect scenario for a breakthrough, or breakdown, for
Carpinello in a role made famous on film by John Travolta.
Producers aren't counting on his name recognition to sell tickets,
but if his moves are less than ideal, critics may be jive talkin'
about Carpinello.
</P>
<P>
   Another breakthrough watch is on at ``Marie Christine,'' the
composer Michael John LaChiusa's adaptation of ``Medea,'' set on
the bayou. The musical, opening at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in
December, stars Audra McDonald, a three-time Tony winner considered
one of the theater's brightest young stars.
</P>
<P>
   The question here is whether Ms. McDonald, who won each of her
Tonys in supporting roles, can excel as a leading lady. One
producer dismissed the concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Tonys? At 29?'' he said. ``You do the math.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nathan Lane and Victor Garber will be in a workshop
production of Stephen Sondheim's con man musical ``Wise Guys,''
starting at the New York Theater Workshop in late October. The
workshop is seen as a warm-up for a spring Broadway run. Critics
aren't allowed in, but you can expect bootleg reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wise Guys'' is the first of several Sondheim shows, a summary
of which sounds like the old wedding day ritual: something old,
something new, some Carol Burnett revue. There's an October
production of ``Do I Hear a Waltz?,'' Sondheim's 1965 collaboration
with Richard Rodgers, at the George Street Playhouse in New
Brunswick, N.J., and ``Putting it Together,'' with Ms. Burnett,
opening on Broadway on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The fall's major revival is ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' the 1948 Cole
Porter musical about the backstage battles of an estranged couple,
opening on Nov. 18 at the Martin Beck. Everything about the
production has a classy feel, with choreography by Kathleen
Marshall (artistic director of the ``Encores!'' series), and a
top-notch cast (Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie star)
assembled by the director Michael Blakemore (``City of Angels'').
The challenge is to generate buzz with a musical that has never had
a Broadway revival.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Swing,'' a collection of songs and dance
highlighting the swing music and dance fad. It opens on Dec. 9, but
there is one worrisome omen; those nifty Gap ads have stopped
running.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLAYS
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson will play the smooth-talking Starbuck in the
Roundabout's revival of ``The Rainmaker,'' opening on Nov. 11 at
the Atkinson. Can Woody pull off stage acting? Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, producers can't seem to get enough of grande dames.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, ``Scent of the Roses'' will bow at the Belasco with
the six-time Tony winner Julie Harris as a South African dowager
with a valuable painting. On Dec. 16, Noel Coward's ``Waiting in
the Wings,'' about a group of retired actresses, flies into the
Walter Kerr. The stately cast list includes Ms. Bacall and Rosemary
Harris. Jokes about the cast's collective age are circulating, but
the show has racked up over $2 million in sales in the last month,
said its producer, Alexander H. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Two new comedies round out the list. The first, ``Epic
Proportions,'' by Larry Coen and David Crane which opens on Sept.
30 at the Helen Hayes, follows the misadventures of a crew filming
a 1930's biblical epic. Homeless as of yet, but intriguing, is
``Wrong Mountain,'' David Hirson's tweaked look at the theater and
its absurdities. (A giant parasitic worm has a large role.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most interesting ensemble is ``The Dead,'' a musical
adaptation of Joyce's short story opening at Playwrights Horizons
in October. In addition to Walken, the cast includes Blair Brown,
Daisy Eagan and the performance artist John Kelly. (Just imagine
the cigarette breaks.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be raw,'' said the producer Gregory Mosher. ``It's a
new musical, so it may take a few months to shake out.''
</P>
<P>
   He may just as easily have been speaking of the season to come.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: A PAPER'S TRAIL TO A WACKY WORLD
 &HT;    By JOE MURRAY
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I'm visiting in our nation's capital for most of
the month of September, seeing what I can see and writing what I
can write.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington bureau of Cox Newspapers has an apartment to
accommodate visiting editors, and that's where I've set up
housekeeping. Just what I need: bedroom and living room, kitchen
and bath, and located not far from the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   No telling what the rent amounts to, but I'd guess that back
home in Lufkin, Texas, for the same money each month you could be
paying off a two-story house on a three-acre lot.
</P>
<P>
   Nice place, though _ fancy enough that there's a security guard
around the clock, making sure the lobby doors are always locked.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what it is out there that they're so worried about.
Probably better that I don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   But what I like most is that each morning there's a fresh
Washington Post outside my apartment door. The Post, most people
agree, is one of the two great newspapers in America, the other, of
course, being the Lufkin Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   It's a special privilege living in a city where there's a great
newspaper. The least I can do is read it.
</P>
<P>
   That's how I'm currently occupying myself, sipping on a
fresh-brewed cup of coffee and savoring the news of the day. If you
like, feel free to read over my shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The top story is headlined ``Yeltsin Linked To Bribe Scheme,''
all about an investigation showing evidence that a Swiss
construction company has been paying off credit card bills for the
Russian president and his two daughters, amounting to tens of
thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on free enterprise. In the good old days of communism,
daughters didn't have credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Here's something even worse, to my way of thinking: Guns seized
by police in neighboring Fairfax County, Va., have been used as
trade-ins for new weapons for officers, rather than having them
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   No way of knowing how many find their way back into the hands of
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of wonderful quotes:
</P>
<P>
   From the police chief, ``We do it as a cost-saving measure,
saving the taxpayers money. A lot of police departments do it. It's
legal.''
</P>
<P>
   From a county supervisor, ``My God. I did not know.''
</P>
<P>
   Which of the two seems to you the more honest?
</P>
<P>
   Moving right along, the moving finger writes that a new poll
shows Bush would win over Gore, 56-37 percent, with only 7 percent
undecided, if the election were held today.
</P>
<P>
   As for who is considered the stronger leader, Bush is the
overwhelming choice with 70 percent. Obviously, neither substance
nor substance abuse seems to be at issue.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't think these are perilous times in our nation's
capital, consider this: The D.C. Superior Court is quickly running
out of free lawyer money, maybe as soon as next week when it
reaches a $25 million spending cap imposed by an uncaring Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That's the funding used for hiring court-appointed attorneys for
indigent crime suspects. Rep. James P. Moran Jr., D-Va., called the
situation ``inexplicable and inexcusable.'' He took the words right
out of taxpayers' mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, D.C. police have no choice but to concentrate on
arresting a better class of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this fashion note: Elizabeth Dole is getting less bangs
for her buck at the beauty shop.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP presidential contender has ``a new bangs-free, unpoufy
coiffure'' ... that's ``not only softer, it is easier to
maintain.''
</P>
<P>
   See, I've learned something already in Washington _ a new word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unpoufy.'' If only we could say the same for more of our
political leaders.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. has been on a roll _ toting up record sales and
profits, assembling a stable of foreign subsidiaries including
Volvo and Jaguar, taking a lead in cutting pollution from light
trucks, forging into uncharted waters with a strategy to offer an
array of consumer services of which cars will be just a part.
</P>
<P>
   Only students of history or those with long memories will recall
how this dynamic company has sometimes teetered on the precipice _
most notably, just after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ford was in a financial free-fall at a time when its
founder, Henry Ford, was growing senile and incapable of wielding a
firm hand over a company bedeviled by strikes, material shortages
and archaic manufacturing processes. Ultimately, the company was
saved by Henry's young grandson, Henry II, and a group of ``whiz
kid'' executives recruited from the Army Air Force. And it was
saved, too, by a car, which turned 50 years old this year.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ground-breaking '86 Taurus that appeared during another
troubled chapter in the company's history, the '49 Ford was born of
desperation. It was sleek and daring by the standards of the day;
it set benchmarks for styling and packaging, and it proved to be a
hit with a car-buying public that was hungry for anything new from
an industry that had curtailed production during the war, then
started anew for 1946 with the old prewar designs.
</P>
<P>
   The car now known as the '49 Ford would not have existed but for
Henry Ford II (who died in 1987, and who was the uncle of the
current chairman, William Clay Ford Jr.)
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1940s, the company had fallen to No. 3 in sales,
behind General Motors and Chrysler, and was losing $9 million a
month; Robert McNamara, who rose through Ford's ranks in the '50s
to become president, once said that the company had not shown an
appreciable profit in the 20 years before Henry II took over. This
was in stark contrast with GM, which became healthier and wealthier
each year.
</P>
<P>
   As old Henry Ford was losing touch _ his pacifist, anti-union,
anti-Semitic views had tarnished the good will he once gained with
his willingness to hire blacks and improve the lot of working
people _ his most trusted aide, a combative ex-fighter named Harry
Bennett, was poised to take over. Henry's son, Edsel, was dead, and
the Ford family concluded that its only hope to save the company
was to install Henry II, then 28 years old, as president. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In September 1945, Henry's wife, Clara, and Eleanor Ford,
Edsel's widow and Henry II's mother, joined forces to give the
patriarch an ultimatum: Either make his grandson president or
Eleanor would sell her 42 percent stake. Henry, darkly able to
comprehend, didn't want strangers to take over, so he resigned and
elevated Henry II. The pugnacious, pistol-packing Bennett was
immediately ousted. Henry died in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the unenviable position of trying to stem the flow of
red ink and realizing he couldn't save the company alone, Henry II
hired the best business talent money could buy. Immediately after
the war, the 10 Whiz Kids _ bright former Air Force officers with
advanced degrees in economics and management _ offered themselves
as a package deal. In addition to McNamara, they were Charles B.
Thornton, Ben D. Mills, Arjay Miller, George Moore, W.R. Anderson,
C.E. Bosworth, J.E. Lundy, Francis C. Reith and James O. Wright.
These men brought modern business practices and accounting
principles to Ford. And Henry II lured a former GM vice president,
Ernest R. Breech, away from Bendix Aviation and empowered him to do
whatever was necessary to save the company.
</P>
<P>
   Breech convinced Henry II that Ford needed to rebuild itself
along the lines of GM Breech hired Harold T. Youngren, Oldsmobile's
former chief engineer, who assembled a staff of 120 additional
engineers, many from GM Breech essentially ran Ford until Henry II
edged him aside a decade later by telling him, ``I've graduated.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like every other American automaker, Ford yearned to get a new,
restyled postwar car on the road as quickly as possible. Breech
recognized that the car proposed by Ford's chief stylist, E.T.
Gregorie, would be too large, heavy and expensive to serve as an
entry-level Ford, so Breech made it the 1949 Mercury. Gregorie's
proposed Mercury became the '49 Lincoln. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that left the company without a '49 Ford. Breech contacted a
golfing buddy, industrial designer George W. Walker, who came up
with a smaller, lighter design. (The styling of the car was
actually done by a team of Studebaker designers at the behest of a
laid-off colleague, who thought _ correctly, as it turned out _ he
could land a job with Walker if he could present a suitable styling
proposal for the next Ford.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walker's 1949 Ford went into production in May '48, and despite
manufacturing glitches _ leaks, rattles and the like _ proved a
tremendous hit. Its ``spinner'' grille, evocative of an airplane
propeller, became a Ford touch. The sedan seated six, its trunk
carried farmers' milk cans upright and its clean, squarish
silhouette and flush fenders made its styling a benchmark. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Youngren, the engineer, developed an independent front
suspension similar to GM's, and reworked Ford's aging V8 engine to
improve its cooling and add horsepower. Ford also, for the first
time, offered a conventional overdrive transmission instead of a
two-speed rear axle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Base prices ranged from $1,333 to $3,563 ($9,600 to $26,000 in
1999 dollars). Production for the year exceeded 1.1 million, though
Chevrolet still slightly outsold Ford.
</P>
<P>
   More important was the car's legacy. Although a new Ford body
arrived for 1952, the 1949-51 cars established a clean, modern look
that set a pattern for many Fords to come. Indeed, J. Mays, the
wunderkind who now heads Ford's design operations as a vice
president, has held up the '49 as an example of the honest and
unpretentious style he wants to see in future Fords. ``People buy
Fords because they are genuine, honest, salt of the earth,'' he
said in a 1997 interview, adding that the '49 was notable for its
``integrity to the Ford brand.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, no automaker really needed an all-new postwar car
so soon, because pent-up demand guaranteed Detroit a sellers'
market for anything on wheels from the war's end until 1951. Yet
car manufacturers raced to get new designs to the public; first out
were redesigned '47 models from Kaiser, Frazer and Studebaker.
</P>
<P>
   This was a period, too, when the Big Three solidified their
market positions and began driving out the so-called independents
like Crosley, Nash, Packard and Willys. The '49 car brought Ford
back from death's door and kept it in the big leagues. In 1950,
Ford Motor Co. passed Chrysler to reclaim the No. 2 spot among
automakers.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS IN 2nd TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Historic, but Often Overlooked &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1949 Ford Sold Better Then Than Now
</P>
<P>
   As important as the 1949 Ford was in saving the company and
setting a design course, the car has never been especially popular
among collectors. Older and newer Fords tend to be more prized:
those from the 1930s, for example, or two-seat Thunderbirds and
first-generation Mustangs.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of '49 Fords range from about $3,000 for a sedan in fair
shape to $8,500 for a similar car in excellent condition, according
to the ``Cars of Particular Interest Value Guide.'' Rare body
styles, like convertibles and station wagons, command substantially
more, from $12,800 to $31,000. But there aren't a lot of sedans and
coupes left, partly because the '49s weren't especially well built.
The August issue of Hemmings Motor News listed only 11 Fords for
sale, compared with 20 Fords from '40 and 17 from '36.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are reproduction parts as plentiful as for earlier models.
Almost every nut and bolt is being reproduced for early V8 Fords
through '48, but there are fewer for '49-'51 models.

   MIDEAST-PEACE _ BEITUNIA, West Bank _ Scenes of weeping men and
jubilant family reunions Thursday illustrated new peace process
momentum, as Israel turned over prisoners and land to the
Palestinians. These were the first tangible steps of the peace
agreement signed last weekend. Coming a few days ahead of schedule,
they, at least momentarily, diminished the disappointment
Palestinians feel in a peace process plagued by delays. A handful
of Israelis protested the release of men they consider terrorists,
but, at homes throughout the occupied territories, Palestinians
were firing gunshots and slaughtering sheep in honor of their
returning heroes. Next, Israel is supposed to open a route for
Palestinians to travel between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
Oct. 1 and release 150 more prisoners Oct. 8. (Kaplow, Cox News

   MEXICO-PRI _ MEXICO CITY _ Mexicans never saw anything like it
before. Two top presidential contenders from the same party sparred
bitterly during a historic debate Wednesday night. The debate was
among the four contenders for the presidential nomination
representing Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI. Former Tabasco Gov. Roberto Madrazo, who is running a campaign
against his own party's record, came out a clear winner according
to overnight polls. Analysts say he is the man to watch. But will
he continue an aggressive campaign or fade under pressure from the
party elite? (Ferriss, Cox News Service)

NFL MATCHUPS FOR WEEK 1 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The following games will be played this weekend and Monday night
in The National Football League:
</P>
<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Vikings at Falcons (4 p.m. Sunday)
</P>
<P>
   ``What did we play in last year?'' asks cornerback Ray Buchanan,
``a fantasy football league?'' The Falcons are at it already.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T. The Falcons say they are getting none. In a way they
are right. The Vikings are favored in one of the most intriguing
opening-day matchups in years. But they should be. Atlanta will see
that life without star receiver Tony Martin, whose speed softened
defenses, will be much more difficult. And Vikings wide receiver
Randy Moss will do more than run deep routes. He is now a complete
receiver. Minnesota's defense will be much better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Vikings, 30-27
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals at Eagles
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer this week ripped the Cardinals organization over
how they were handling the contract holdout of star wide receiver
Rob Moore. Several days later Moore was in camp. That is the
growing influence of Plummer inside the organization and it will
soon be felt across the league. Plummer will play with a sore thumb
and wide receiver Frank Sanders has an injured ankle but Arizona
has more than enough firepower to beat what may be one of the worst
teams in the league this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals, 20-7
</P>
<P>
   Ravens at Rams
</P>
<P>
   Brian Billick is one of the best offensive minds in the league
but last year he was working with Moss and Cunningham and Carter,
now he must coach the enigmatic Scott Mitchell. Suffice to say that
Baltimore won't be scoring 556 points the way Billick's Vikings did
last year. Still the Ravens may surprise a few people solely
because of Billick's smarts alone. Meanwhile, the Rams were
promising until quarterback Trent Green was lost for the year with
a knee injury. His replacement Kurt Warner makes his first NFL
start. It won't be a memorable one.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 17-0
</P>
<P>
   Bills at Colts
</P>
<P>
   Coach Wade Phillips has used some interesting language in
describing his quarterback situation. He calls Doug Flutie the
starter but says backup Rob Johnson is a close second. Why Flutie
just isn't The Guy and that's that is a mystery. It is as if the
5'9'' Flutie still suffers from vertical discrimination. Then there
is Manning, who should have a breakout season. This game could be a
great one because the past nine meetings between these two teams
have been decided by seven points or less. But also the quarterback
play should be outstanding. The problem for Manning is that Buffalo
has a far better defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bills, 30-20
</P>
<P>
   Panthers at Saints
</P>
<P>
   New Carolina Coach George Seifert has a sparkling 98-30 career
NFL coaching record. He won't see a winning season this year as the
Panthers are clearly rebuilding. New Orleans is not. They have
running back Ricky Williams, who looks like a good player. What
Williams will see against Carolina is what he will see each week:
Seven and eight man fronts. Quarterback Billy Joe Hobert scares no
one but is good enough to pass this weak test.
</P>
<P>
   Saints, 21-13
</P>
<P>
   Bengals at Titans
</P>
<P>
   In his six career starts against Tennessee quarterback Jeff
Blake is 3-3 with a 93.9 passer rating, but the Titans have won
three of the past four games. The reason why is running back Eddie
George, who has rushed for 538 yards during that span. Cincinnati
gave up an average of 360.2 total yards a game last season and did
nothing in the off-season to improve its defense.
</P>
<P>
   Titans, 24-14
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys at Redskins
</P>
<P>
   One of the best rivalries in the history of the league has lost
some of its spark, but this is still one of the most important
games of the week. The Cowboys, Redskins and Giants are all close
in talent level but the Cowboys, especially on offense, have an
edge because of their aging but still skilled veterans. Last season
Dallas' offensive line allowed a league-low 19 sacks and might be
better this year. But Washington is playing at home where it has
won four of its past five games. The home cooking is what gets it
done for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins, 21-14
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs at Bears
</P>
<P>
   One of the near certainties in the NFL is that Kansas City will
play well in the regular-season and fall apart in the playoffs. In
the 1990s Kansas City's opening day record is 8-1, tying the
franchise with Miami for tops in the league. Elvis Grbac is an
average quarterback but he is much better than Shane Matthews,
making his first NFL start for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs, 20-3
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Patriots at Jets
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Bill Parcells, coaching against Pete Carroll it
is no contest. Parcells is 5-1 against him, mainly because Parcells
knows the New England personnel as well or better than Carroll
does. Throw in the fact that the Jets have won five of the past
seven home games against New England and the Jets should win. But
it will be close, since under Parcells his teams usually play
average football the first few games, then take off. This year will
probably be different because Parcells is ready to make a
championship run.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 35-14
</P>
<P>
   Raiders at Packers
</P>
<P>
   These two teams have not played each other since December of
1993. For the Raiders this is the beginning of a brutal season
thanks to the league's toughest schedule. There is little chance
the Raiders can win this game because the Packers have a 60-20 home
record since 1989 and it would take a lot better team than Oakland
to get their season off to a bad start.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 30-10
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Lions at Seahawks
</P>
<P>
   No Barry Sanders means few victories for Detroit. Ron Rivers
just isn't quite the same thing. Besides, Seattle has won its last
three home games against Detroit. The Lions plan to open up their
passing game a little more this season out of necessity since
Sanders is gone. And why not? Little else will work. The advantage
clearly belongs to Seattle because they will be able to pound the
ball with running back Ricky Watters.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks, 26-6
</P>
<P>
   Giants at Buccaneers
</P>
<P>
   Two of the fastest, most well coached defenses face each other
in the opening week. The Giants always have a difficult time with
Tampa Bay, losing two straight games. This occasion should be
different. Defensive end Michael Strahan leads the NFL with 29
sacks over the past two seasons and he is determined to push the
Giants deep into postseason. He is good enough to carry the team on
his back alone. Also, quarterback Kent Graham, because of what he
perceives as a front-office snub, is out to prove he can be a top
player in this league.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 13-10
</P>
<P>
   49ers at Jaguars
</P>
<P>
   When San Francisco this week released safety Merton Hanks the
significance of the move was missed by many. The 49ers are old and
their stars, like Hanks, are losing their potency. Meanwhile, all
around them, teams are getting younger. With Bryant Young still
recovering from his broken leg, San Francisco has no one to stop
the young stud, second-year player Fred Taylor, who tied Moss last
year for a rookie-high 17 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 42-28
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Steelers at Browns
</P>
<P>
   The fact that football is back in Cleveland is a beautiful
thing. That is the fun part. Reality will hit the city sometime
around the second quarter. The Browns will be good in several years
because of general manager Carmen Policy but for now this is not a
good team. Ty Detmer is the quarterback, they will start a rookie
at wide receiver and cornerback, and Chris Palmer is in his first
year as head coach. The only wildcard: Running back Jerome Bettis
is questionable with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers, 20-10
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Miami at Denver
</P>
<P>
   This game should be tight, since five of the past six meetings
have been decided by seven points or less. Normally this has the
smell of a big Broncos win. Season opener. Monday Night Football.
John Elway's induction into the team's hall of fame at halftime.
And the Broncos have won 24 regular-season home games. But Miami
actually has more offensive firepower than Denver. And the Dolphins
have all sorts of wild defensive schemes to throw off first-time
starter Brian Griese, who looked great in preseason, but that was
then.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, 21-20

DANFORTH PROMISES TO ASK THE `DARK QUESTIONS' ABOUT WACO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Republican Sen. John Danforth, appointed
Thursday by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate the FBI's
April 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound that ended in a
deadly inferno, said he will seek answers to the ``dark questions''
about the ill-fated raid.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them, Danforth said at a packed news conference at
the Justice Department here, are: ``Was there a cover-up? ... Did
the government kill people? How did the fire start? And was there
shooting (by government agents)?''
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Danforth, 63, an 18-year veteran of the
Senate and a former Missouri attorney general, was Reno's latest
salvo in an effort to blunt cascading Republican criticism over
revelations that the FBI launched incendiary tear-gas devices into
the compound in the final hours of its 51-day siege there.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said at the news conference that the revelations _ coming
after she and FBI officials had denied for six years that flammable
devices had been used _ ``have caused the American people to raise
new questions, questions that deserve to be answered. Senator
Danforth, I think, is a person who can find those answers.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth left the Senate in 1995 and is respected by members of
both parties for his independence and integrity. One of his last
forays into the limelight came in 1991 when he strongly defended
Clarence Thomas, whose bid for confirmation as a Supreme Court
justice, was almost sunk when law professor Anita Hill charged that
he had made improper sexual remarks and advances _ allegations that
Thomas denied.
</P>
<P>
   The embattled Reno brushed aside Republican calls for her
resignation. ``I don't run from controversy, and I don't run from
situations where we need to pursue the matter to get to the truth
and then take whatever steps are appropriate,'' she said. On
Wednesday Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott became the
highest-ranking Republican to urge her to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, after her long defense of the FBI's actions in the April
19, 1993 raid, is known to have been furious when, on Aug. 25, the
bureau finally acknowledged use of the devices and when it later
discovered two videotapes recording the decision to use the
canisters but took four days to tell her it had the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and FBI officials still maintain that even though the
canisters were used, the fire that swept the compound was set by
the Davidians themselves. About 80 cult members died, many of them
children.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's news conference, Danforth said he had been assured
complete independence in conducting his probe. He said he has
authority to subpoena witnesses, to empanel a grand jury and to
question both Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that to avoid a conflict, she would hand
administrative control over the Danforth probe to Deputy Attorney
General Eric Holder, who was not involved in any decision-making
over Waco.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department press release quoted Freeh as saying, ``I
welcome the attorney general's selection of Senator Danforth.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno praised the former senator as ``a man of impeccable
credentials, a record of integrity and a determination to get to
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, now in private law practice in St. Louis, said he will
steer clear of investigating what he termed ``judgment calls'' by
law enforcement in the events leading up to the FBI's final raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country can survive bad judgment. But the thing that
really undermines the integrity of government is whether there were
bad acts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judgment calls, he added, include whether the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was justified in initiating an
investigation of the Branch Davidians for firearms violations. Four
BATF agents were killed in a shootout at the Davidian compound on
Feb. 28, 1993, an event that started the FBI's standoff with the
cult and its enigmatic leader, David Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's order appointing the senator directs him to investigate
whether any FBI agent or other government official lied or withheld
evidence or suppressed evidence in the aftermath of the Waco
disaster. Danforth also is empowered to probe whether FBI agents
fired on the compound and whether U.S. military personnel were
misused in any way.
</P>
<P>
   In a display of bipartisanship, Reno said Danforth will be
assisted by Edward Dowd, the U.S. attorney in St. Louis. Dowd is a
Democrat who was recommended for his current post by House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. He will resign his position and begin
building a staff of lawyers and investigators, working initially
out of Danforth's St. Louis law office.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said FBI agents will not be used for investigative work
in his probe. He also said he has no intention of asking Congress
to halt its own investigations of Waco until his is complete. Two
such probes are under way, with Republican leaders promising open
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell people in Congress what to do,'' Danforth said.
``I wouldn't begin to do that.'' He added that he expects his own
probe to be completed by the end of President Clinton's term, which
is Jan. 20, 2001.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Capitol Hill reaction to the Danforth appointment was positive.
``I have a great deal of respect for Sen. John Danforth,'' said
Senate Judiciary Chairman Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``I am
confident that he will do his level best to accomplish the goals
tasked to him by the attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said congressional probes are warranted because ``Congress
was misled by the executive branch.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said of Danforth:
``There's no more honorable person that has served in the Senate.
He will do a superb job.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., called Reno's choice ``a superb
appointment. He's a Republican but he's above partisan motive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said he would hold off on legislation establishing a
five-member bipartisan commission to investigate the Waco incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``All investigative resources must be made available so that
Sen. Danforth can complete this inquiry as quickly as possible,''
Hyde said. ``Six years has been too long to wait for the truth.''

<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ Raiders cornerback Charles Woodson was taken
aback when he first saw the betting line on Sunday's season opener
in Green Bay.

   Despite having the fifth-ranked defense in the NFL last year,
the oddsmakers listed the Packers as 9 1/2-point favorites over the
Raiders in the opening line.

   ``Man, that's pretty rough,'' Woodson said. ``It's like they're
saying we don't belong on the same field as those guys. The coaches
made mention of it. And we're looking forward to going out and
proving ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders feel they possess a championship-caliber defense and
get their first chance to confirm that sentiment on against Brett
Favre, arguably the best quarterback in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful right arm and playmaking ability of Favre will give
the Raiders an indication of just how staunch their defense is at
football's most famous address, Lambeau Field. And the Raiders'
defense, which ranked fifth overall last year, isn't shying away
from this challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to go against the best right off the bat because you
know that you're going to have to be at your best to be
successful,'' defensive tackle Russell Maryland said. ``Going
against a guy like Brett Favre makes it easy to keep the guys'
attention during the week. This game isn't going to make or break
our season, but it will give us a true test of where we need the
most work.''
</P>
<P>
   Designing defenses to deal with Favre can cause several
sleepless nights for defensive coordinators. With some
quarterbacks, keeping them in the pocket and not allowing them to
scramble is one method for success. But Favre can destroy a defense
while throwing from the pocket, and he's equally as effective when
he's forced to scramble and improvise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brett Favre's obviously dangerous when he breaks
containment,'' said coach Jon Gruden. ``He's dangerous wherever he
is with the ball. We have got to do a great job of holding our
coverage and maintaining our lane integrity in terms of our rush.''
</P>
<P>
   According to cornerback Charles Woodson, Favre's ability to
improvise is his strongest asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's a playmaker and has the ability to get himself out
of trouble,'' Woodson said. ``When he's running around, that means
we have to stay with their receivers for a longer period of time.
But I think we'll do all right.''
</P>
<P>
   What should be cause for concern for the Raiders is that Favre,
a three-time league MVP, says he's in the best shape of his life.
He dropped 20 pounds in the offseason, which should make him even
more elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm about 215, 216, which is much lighter than I have been in
the past,'' Favre said. ``I feel the best I've ever felt,
physically and mentally. I've worked this offseason to give my team
the best possible chance to win and I feel like I've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite throwing 31 touchdowns last season, it was an erratic
season for
</P>
<P>
   Favre. He also tossed 23 interceptions, which was the
second-highest total of his career. The Raiders hope they can bring
out the skittish side of Favre on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to go out and play Oakland Raiders' defense, not
fall into the trap of playing Brett Favre's game,'' said defensive
end James Harris. ``Sometimes he's going to get outside the pocket.
We just have to try to force him into some mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Packers are breaking in a new head coach (Ray
Rhodes), one would think that Favre might have difficulty learning
a new offensive system. But fortunately for Favre and the Green Bay
offense, they'll run the same West Coast offense they've been
running when Mike Holmgren was there from 1992-98. Offensive
coordinator Sherm Lewis remains on staff and will be the man
calling the plays. Holmgren called the plays while he was coach.
But with change comes the factor of the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of starting over again, even though a bulk of our
veteran players are still here and the nucleus that has gotten us
to where we are is still here,'' Favre said. ``We still feel like
we're starting over and not sure of what's going to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Favre is concerned that the timing between him and his favorite
target, receiver Antonio Freeman, is not where it should be.
Freeman, because of a contract dispute, missed all of the team's
minicamps and most of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Antonio and I) haven't had that much practice time together
and in preseason games I think I threw one ball to him,'' Favre
said. ``We're not where we want to be and we won't be for this
game. We won't be for the next game. It's going to take some time
because he missed every minicamp and he showed up halfway through
training camp. So we're not where we want to be, but that's part of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Any glitch with Favre and Freeman can only help the Raiders.

 &HT;    WorldCom withdraws support for BellSouth network tests
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A key rival to BellSouth for the future of the Georgia
phone market has pulled out of the process for testing BellSouth's
network, threatening not to offer local service here unless the
system dramatically improves.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharply worded filing with the state Public Service
Commission, Mississippi-based MCI WorldCom argued that the testing
_ aimed at proving BellSouth is ready for competitors _ will
instead let it off the hook. C.K. Casteel Jr., MCI WorldCom
regional executive, said involvement in the tests here would mean
spending millions of dollars on a virtually foreordained result.
Although administered by Hewlett-Packard and KPMG, the test was
designed by BellSouth, he said. ``They are likely to clear the
two-foot high jump _ the bar they prepared for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom will focus on Florida, where testing should be more
complete, Casteel said. MCI WorldCom, the nation's second-largest
long-distance company, offers local service to businesses and wants
to compete for consumers, too, Casteel said. ``If you do the right
things, we will come here as fast as we can. If you don't, we won't
come here ever _ it really is that clear-cut.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom wants the PSC to revise the tests. Not likely, said
PSC spokesman Bart Gobeil. The tests were shaped and approved by
the commission, he said. ``It's almost insulting, the idea that we
are just going to do what what BellSouth wants. We are going to do
what the people of Georgia want.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous occasions in which a host of companies acted
together in critiquing BellSouth's efforts, this time MCI WorldCom
stood alone. The largest potential ally, AT&AMP;T, is simply not ready
to abandon the testing effort, said spokesman Bryant Steele.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Telecom Act requires Bell companies to build
connections to local networks that allow rivals to compete on equal
footing. When those systems are endorsed by federal regulators,
BellSouth will be permitted to offer long-distance. Phil Jacobs,
BellSouth president for Georgia, criticized MCI WorldCom for
shifting from Georgia to a state where the process is less
advanced. ``This is yet another stall tactic. We think we are close
_ and MCI WorldCom must think we are close, too.

REPORTER TRIES TO LEARN WHAT DAD DIDN'T SAY ABOUT WWII SUB DUTY
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Repeating story moved originally Sept. 7 to fix name of
submarine from Blowfish to Bowfin in last graf of first take;
accompanied by info box, SUB SERVICE-HAMMERHEAD) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAX B. BAKER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ They knew him as ``Alby.''
</P>
<P>
   His real name was Arthur L. Baker. In 1942, he was 18 and
gangling, with dark, thick, wavy hair and an angular jaw. ``Alby''
is what his buddies called him, and my dad stenciled that name onto
his sailor's cap.
</P>
<P>
   He served about three years in the Navy as a torpedoman on the
USS Hammerhead, a 312-foot submarine, with about 70 other enlisted
men. Dad's job was to slide the torpedoes into the tubes and launch
them.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, I romanticized my dad's years in the Navy and his
adventures beneath the South China Sea. I loved to open a glass
bank to look at the foreign currency and tiny wartime snapshots
he'd stuffed in there.
</P>
<P>
   It was heady stuff. My old man _ a Chevrolet dealer in Odessa,
Mo., a town on the edge of the tall-grass prairie, about 40 miles
east of Kansas City _ sinking Japanese ships, dodging depth charges
and swimming in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   But other than a few funny stories he liked to tell, all I had
from Dad's war years were those fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   He was a quiet, introspective man who didn't talk about the war.
When he died of lung cancer more than 11 years ago _ passing away
three hours after the birth of my son, Ben _ he took his stories
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Ben and my daughter, Johanna, who was born three years later,
ask about Grandpa Baker. To them, he's an abstraction _ a
photograph on a bookshelf, a guy my mom talks about when we visit
her in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   So when a friend told me the U.S. Submarine Veterans of World
War II were holding their annual convention in Fort Worth this
year, I decided to stop by _ to see if I could answer a few
questions about my dad for my kids.
</P>
<P>
   And for myself.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   During a stroll around the Radisson Plaza Hotel last week, a
visitor could pick up snatches of war stories from the more than
1,600 submariners who attended the convention.
</P>
<P>
   When they served nearly 50 years ago, they were young and strong
and in the prime of life. Now they are in their 70s and 80s, their
once-clear skin mottled with age spots, their hair silver or gray.
Two of the veterans were tethered to oxygen tanks. One used a cane.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing bright yellow-and-blue vests festooned with Navy
insignia and embroidered with their boats' names, the men scanned
the faces and the names on the vests, looking for long-lost
shipmates. There were gleams of recognition, slaps on the back,
emotion-heavy conversations as they recalled adventures and lost
friends of a half-century past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard stories about me in the Navy I haven't heard,''
joked Pete Cook, 78, of Eaton Rapid, Mich., who was a motor
machinist on the Sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to find someone who knew my dad, I went to a table that
held three-ring notebooks containing sign-in sheets for the boat
crews. No names appeared on the sheet for the Hammerhead.
</P>
<P>
   There were crew members from the Amberjack, Guardfish, Seacat,
Bowfish, Sculpin and Sailfish. But no one who sailed with my dad on
the Hammerhead's first three war patrols, from June 1944 to January
1945, had registered so far.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at the registration desk, Joe Allison of Fort Worth wore
a gimme cap emblazoned with the name of his boat, the Silversides.
Allison, a 75-year-old retired trucking company transportation
manager, wore a button on his vest showing him in his Navy uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was about 25 then,'' Allison laughed, lifting up his
hat. ``I had hair back then, too. It was a long time ago, you know
it. ...''
</P>
<P>
   From Allison and retired Rear Adm. Corwin ``Mendy'' Mendenhall
of Benbrook, Texas _ who was selling his book ``Submarine Diary'' _
I learned something of what my dad's life was like aboard the
Hammerhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of submarine service was silence and secrecy; long
stretches of tedium and waiting, interrupted occasionally by brief
periods of excitement, terror and peril,'' Mendenhall writes in his
book. ``From the standpoint of public visibility and wartime
recognition, the role of the submarine navy was scarcely
glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   They lived in steel tubes with passageways so narrow that
sailors had to sit down or flatten themselves against a bulkhead to
allow others to pass by. A submarine's groaning metal skin was so
thin that crewmen could hear the clicks of the firing pins in the
depth charges before they exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The subs' torpedoes were inferior and sometimes didn't work.
They didn't have advanced radar; equipment was known to jam or
malfunction. Most of the officers were in their 30s; many enlisted
men were still in their teens.
</P>
<P>
   One war correspondent wrote that submarines _ called boats from
the German word ``unterseeboot'' _ slid into harbor ``salt-caked,
battered and ugly.'' Personal hygiene was an expendable luxury. The
men reeked after months of washing _ and then infrequently _ with
oily-smelling water collected from the condensation on pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Handpicked and psychologically tested, 16,000 sailors served on
288 U.S. submarines during World War II. They made up about 2
percent of the nation's naval force but are credited with about 55
percent of the Japanese ships sunk during the war. Self-described
``night crawlers,'' they did most of their work in the dark,
without fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   They were a tight-knit, clannish bunch. And they died in record
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The fatality rate for the Navy overall was about 2 percent. But
on submarines, 22 percent of the sailors _ or more than one in
every five _ did not come home. Fifty-two submarines were lost; 375
officers and 3,131 enlisted men died.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought we were crazy. I don't know if it was
romantic,'' said Malcolm Cross, 76, of Fort Worth, an ensign on the
Tench. ``Once you left Pearl Harbor, you were going west and into
Japanese hunting grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison served as a yeoman on the last four patrols of the
Silversides. He said there were many moments when he was ``scared
as hell,'' one of them when a ``running hot'' torpedo got stuck in
the launch tube.
</P>
<P>
   ``And about that time we got our first depth charge, and I
thought the torpedo went off,'' Allison recalled. ``I jumped out of
my wits.''
</P>
<P>
   Silversides safely ejected the torpedo later.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Fletcher, 74, who lives near San Antonio, told of a daring
daylight attack by his boat, the Bowfin. The sub followed a small
Japanese tanker into a harbor, waited for it to reach port, and
then fired two torpedoes into it.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   ``We sank a ship, a big crane and the dock,'' Fletcher said with
a laugh. ``And then we headed for deep water, so we could submerge
to avoid attacks by aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked these men why my father never told me his stories,
Allison recalled his time as a typist during shore duty on Midway
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I typed the letters of commendation and condolences to the
next of kin for 75 to 80 men,'' Allison said, boasting of his
typing skills. ``It didn't mean as much to me then. I was young,
and it was a job.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he choked up and dabbed his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never told ``my own wife and my own child'' how he
feels now about typing the letters to the names on that list.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Allison shied away from joining veterans groups,
except the one for submarine vets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people ask me, `Did you see any action?' I tell them, `If
anyone served on one patrol, you saw all the action you wanted to
see.'''
</P>
<P>
   All of that made me want to know even more about my dad.
</P>
<P>
   But when I passed by the sign-in books again on my way out,
still, no one from the Hammerhead had registered.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It's a habit I inherited from my father.
</P>
<P>
   I get up late at night to read and think. Dad did the same
thing. Many a time, I tried to sneak in late _ after a night of
doing things I shouldn't _ only to find him sitting at the kitchen
table.
</P>
<P>
   Three nights this past week, I read over the Hammerhead's war
patrol reports. A friend obtained them for me years ago from the
Navy's archives. The reports were written by Capt. J.C. ``Jack''
Martin, skipper of the Hammerhead on the first three of its seven
war patrols.
</P>
<P>
   I try to imagine my father in the torpedo room, or standing
watch on the conning tower, as he experienced the events recounted
in the archives.
</P>
<P>
   The first patrol lasted 72 days, including the voyage from Pearl
Harbor to Fremantle, Australia, and then 33 days in action near the
island of Formosa.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, 1944, at 8:53 a.m., the submerged Hammerhead fired
three torpedoes from its stern tubes at an oiler. The torpedoes
missed, and the sub ``went deep'' to avoid bombs and depth charges
until the ``screws faded out.''
</P>
<P>
   Early the next day, the Hammerhead encountered a 15-ship convoy.
Sunup was only about an hour away, but Martin ordered a surface
attack. A large black rain cloud provided some cover; nevertheless,
Martin wrote, he had ``a very naked feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   After firing six torpedoes, and hearing four explosions, Martin
knew the Hammerhead had hit its target _ a large freighter. The sub
fired four more torpedoes from its stern tubes, probably sinking a
second ship, then submerged.
</P>
<P>
   The Hammerhead scored no more kills before returning to
Fremantle on Aug. 17. But there is a lighthearted entry about the
initiation rite administered to crewmen crossing the equator for
the first time: ``51 polliwogs entered the domain of Neptunus Rex
with appropriate costumes, haircuts and slight medical and
electrical treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hammerhead's second war patrol in the South China Sea lasted
54 days. Martin, my dad and the rest of the crew attacked two
Japanese convoys _ on Oct. 1 and Oct. 20. They sank five cargo
ships and damaged other vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The skipper writes that in the second attack, two ships ``broke
out in flames ... casting a bright glow over that portion of the
horizon. We started cheering, and the two ships started falling
back from the rest of the convoy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the next page, Martin notes: ``Incidentally, none of the
escorts helped the two crippled ships nor made any effort to pick
up what few survivors there might have been. I doubt if there were
any.''
</P>
<P>
   Dad's third war patrol lasted 53 days. The Hammerhead attacked
several convoys and damaged a Japanese oiler but sank no ships. The
seas were rough, and this may have hurt their chances of success.
</P>
<P>
   During a surface passage through the Lombok Strait in Indonesia,
Martin writes, a Japanese patrol boat attacked the submarine. ``It
was interesting watching all those of us left on the bridge trying
to dig foxholes in the decking as the shells landed,'' the skipper
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The Hammerhead returned to Australia from its third patrol in
January 1945. My Dad had already left the boat at Subic Bay in the
Philippines and finally returned to the United States to marry my
mother. After the war ended in August, my parents lived briefly in
California, but they were back home in Missouri by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   I telephoned my mom after reading the war patrol reports. She
recalled that my dad didn't join the submarine veterans
organization when it was established in 1955 and that he ``didn't
trade war stories much.'' But years later, after my dad retired, he
helped form a Missouri chapter of the submarine veterans
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes back to this,'' Mom said. ``They laugh about it among
themselves. ... But they don't tell war stories to other people. It
is hard to drag out of them. They don't care about sharing all
that.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Finally, two men who served on the Hammerhead signed the
registration book.
</P>
<P>
   But when I telephoned 80-year-old Art Rawson in his hotel room,
the Hammerhead's former executive officer said sadly that he and
the other man didn't serve with my dad. Nevertheless, he agreed to
meet me in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good boat. They weren't as lucky as some of the other
subs. We didn't get some of the contacts that some did,'' said
Rawson, a tanned, impish, vivacious man, an Annapolis grad who also
commanded surface ships.
</P>
<P>
   Rawson said that my dad, as part of his job as a torpedoman,
would have checked the fuel level in the torpedoes, made sure the
propellers weren't sticking, and loaded them into the bow and stern
tubes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also may have made what they called `gillie,' or alcohol,''
Rawson said with a laugh. ``When we wanted to have a party, they'd
take this torpedo alcohol and strain it through bread to take out
the impurities. It was awful stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Rawson said he could only guess why my dad didn't talk more
about his wartime experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at this as a team effort, rather than an individual
effort,'' Rawson said. ``We all stood watch.''

   TIMOR-INDONESIA-MILITARY (Jakarta) _ When reports swirled here
on Wednesday that Indonesia's president, B.J. Habibie, was about to
resign, some of his advisers detected the handiwork of the
military. ``The military is strongly against allowing peacekeeping
troops into East Timor,'' said Umar Juoro, an economic adviser to
Habibie. Juoro's suspicions, which are shared by many in Jakarta,
underscore the fact that the army has emerged once again as the
central player in a national crisis. By Mark Landler.

   ISRAEL-PRISONER-RELEASE (Jerusalem) _ The release 199
Palestinian prisoners was the first concrete step in the revival of
the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort. Coming five days after a new
peace agreement was signed in Egypt, the event kicks off a packed
schedule of changes, including an imminent land transfer and the
opening of a safe passage route between the West Bank and Gaza. For
Palestinians it was a day of dancing the debka and firing
celebratory gunshots into the air. But their joy was tempered by a
widespread disappointment with their leaders who, many think,
failed in negotiations to secure the release of enough prisoners.

accept federal spending limits, says the list will be updated each

 &HT;    Early birds: Kids line up for new Harry Potter
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anyone who doubts that kids are wild about Harry
Potter wasn't at any of the Atlanta-area Chapter 11 stores
Wednesday morning. Droves of youngsters and their parents were
lined up at 7 a.m. when the 13 bookstores opened three hours early
for the arrival of the third installment of J.K. Rowling's popular
series.
</P>
<P>
   By 8:15 a.m., more than 1,000 copies of ``Harry Potter and the
Prisoner of Azkaban'' (Scholastic, $19.95) had been sold, says
Chapter 11 owner Barbara Babbitt Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' Kaufman said. ``We sold out by 10. Some
of the kids showed up with their allowances that they had been
saving for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who arrived early got a special deal. For three hours
only, customers could buy the book for $11.99 _ and get free
doughnuts. After 10 a.m., books sold for $13.97.
</P>
<P>
   Other stores in town reported a brisk business, but nothing like
that at Chapter 11. Kaufman sees the huge crowds as a precursor of
what is likely to happen when the author comes to Atlanta for a
book-signing at Hobbit Hall in Roswell on Oct. 20 and at Chapter
11's Peachtree Battle store on Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worrying me already,'' Kaufman says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Precious memories: Celestine Sibley's granddaughter Sibley
Fleming has signed a two-book deal with Hill Street Press in
Athens, Ga., for a novel and a memoir about the late Atlanta
Journal-Constitution columnist. The nonfiction book will feature
Fleming's memories about her grandmother as a public figure and as
a family matriarch. Accompanying the text will be a collection of
never-before-published photographs as well as some recipes the
columnist shared with her granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is about the inheritance left to me by my
grandmother,'' says Fleming, 35, an Atlanta children's book author
and free-lance writer. ``It is not a book about diamond tiaras or
strings of pearls, but instead it is an up-close look at the
richness of life, the miracle of relationships and the wisdom that
comes from greeting each day with an open mind and sense of humor.
Anyone who knew my grandmother knows that not only did she write
about life with passion and grace, but she lived it that way as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill Street president Tom Payton expects to publish the memoir
in time for Mother's Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kid stuff: The Harry Potter books are not the only hot
children's books. Hollywood has discovered that tomes for teens and
younger readers are a rich source for television and feature films.
Among those in the works are ``Drive Me Crazy,'' a film starring
Melissa Joan Hart (``Sabrina the Teenage Witch'') and based on Todd
Strasser's novel, ``How I Created My Perfect Prom Date''; ``Stuart
Little,'' a film based on E.B. White's tale about a mouse raised by
humans; ``Goodnight Moon,'' an HBO film based on Margaret Wise
Brown's children's book; and two feature films from Warner Bros.
based on ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' and ``Harry
Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mystery women: Some say that in the corporate world men
compete and women network, which explains why some female mystery
writers have formed a group called Femmes Fatales to help promote
their books. In addition to publishing a newsletter, the group will
appear on panels at several bookstores in Atlanta this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Femmes are Atlanta writer Teri Holbrook, author of the
recently released ``Sad Water'' and nominated for the prestigious
Edgar, Agatha, Anthony, Macavity and Georgia Author of the Year
awards for her two earlier novels; Elizabeth Daniels Squire, a
Southern mystery writer whose ``Where There's a Will'' is set in
the Asheville, N.C., area and on the high seas; Toni L.P. Kelner, a
North Carolina native who lives in Boston but sets her books,
including the recent ``Death of a Damn Yankee,'' in North Carolina;
and Marlys Millhiser, a Boulder, Colo., native whose latest
mystery, ``Nobody Dies,'' takes place in a Las Vegas casino.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is death, but don't expect a grim panel, Holbrook
says. ``Mystery writers tend to be in a good humor most of the time
since they have used fiction to kill off people they're mad at.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors will appear at the Emory University Library at 5
p.m. Friday; Barnes &AMP; Noble in Buckhead, 2900 Peachtree Road, at 3
p.m. Saturday; Barnes &AMP; Noble in Gwinnett, 2205 Pleasant Hill Road,
at 6:30 p.m. Saturday; and the Science Fiction &AMP; Mystery Book Shop,
2000-F Cheshire Bridge Road N.E., at 2 p.m. Sunday. Information:
770-723-0282.

`AFTERGLOW'

  (jt) 
 By JON PARELES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOT ALLISON: ``Afterglow'' (Arista). Dot Allison's songs dream
of escape. ``Close your eyes,'' she sings, ``let me take you to the
sun.'' In a breathy, hovering voice, she seeks realms where time
stands still: love, longing, heaven. The music wafts around her,
full of wispy chords and muffled echoes and distant effects.
Sometimes there's a stolid beat; sometimes there are no drums
anywhere, only sustained sounds with disorienting electronic edges.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allison was the singer in One Dove, a band from Manchester,
England, that released an album in 1993 and broke up three years
later. Her first solo album, ``Afterglow,'' holds on to One Dove's
juxtaposition of eerie, languorous electronics, bleary borderline
dance music and quietly torchy pop songs; now, she is more willing
to trust in stillness and delicacy. ``Did I Imagine You,'' with
lyrics by Hal David (Burt Bacharach's longtime collaborator), turns
from a hesitant reminiscence into an angelic chorale; ``I Wanna
Feel the Chill'' is a ghost waltz of detuned piano and guitar.
While ``Afterglow'' does have some earthbound moments, for most of
the album Ms. Allison drifts away from everything except a
perpetual yearning.

RELEASED PALESTINIANS MET WITH SUPPORT, DERISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ Kefa Aqra had waited nine years for this
day.
</P>
<P>
   When a bus finally rounded the corner early Thursday carrying
the 199 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons, the 60-year-old
mother strained to see if her 25-year-old son was among those
peering out from the bus windows.
</P>
<P>
   When she saw him, she held on to her traditional white Islamic
veil and ran alongside the bus, reaching up to him and saying,
``This is peace. This is true peace. My son is home. Thank God, my
son is home.''
</P>
<P>
   For the families and supporters of the freed Palestinian
prisoners, it was a day to honor the men they view as war heroes in
the Palestinian struggle and a recognition of what they see as the
fruit of peace.
</P>
<P>
   But for many Israeli victims of the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict, the homecoming scenes were chilling images of criminals
set loose and what they believe is a grave injustice wrought in the
name of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the Palestinian security prisoners is perhaps the
most profoundly emotional issue surrounding the painful
reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians that is the peace
process. And all that emotion was let loose Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While Aqra waited for her son, Wa'el, to go through the final
paperwork before he would be released into the custody of the
Palestinian Authority and freed, a handful of Israeli protesters
screamed at her and the other families gathering to greet prisoners
outside a military checkpoint near Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your sons are murderers! They are murderers! How many did they
kill?'' shouted Meir Indor, head of the Israeli Terror Victims
Association who was wounded in an attack by a militant in Tel Aviv
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame! Shame on you!'' he screamed, his voice cracking with
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner release was a major sticking point in the dramatic
negotiations that led up to last week's signing of a modified
version of the Wye River land-for-security deal. The 200 released
Thursday were the first of some 350 prisoners who will be freed
under the revised agreement dubbed ``Wye II.'' To go free, the men
had to sign a form disavowing the armed struggle against Israel and
expressing support for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Amran Hussein, 33, who had served 14 years in Israel's notorious
Ashqelon Prison for a string of six grenade attacks that wounded
seven Israeli soldiers, said, ``I'm optimistic about peace, that
the struggle will achieve its ends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to look at the Israelis as neighbors and live with
them if I get my full rights,'' he added, surrounded by family
members. ``But if the other prisoners are not released, if the
settlements continue, if house demolitions and land confiscation
continues, then the conflict will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those released had killed Palestinian collaborators
during the violent seven-year ``intifada,'' or uprising, against
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza that ended with
limited self-rule after the signing of a 1994 peace agreement.
Other prisoners had wounded Israelis in attacks, but Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak insisted he would not free anyone who had
killed an Israeli. The terms of the deal also include the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from a further 11 percent of the West
Bank, which when completed will place roughly 40 percent of the
West Bank under full or partial Palestinian control. Those
redeployments are expected as soon as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After processing, Wa'el Aqra was free, and when the bus pulled
into the Palestinian police headquarters in Ramallah he pushed his
way through a crowd and wrapped his mother in his arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our happiness is very great. But it is incomplete. We left
many brothers behind,'' he said, echoing a sentiment expressed by
many of the freed prisoners about the roughly 2,000 of what they
call political prisoners still held in Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Wa'el served nine years for the 1991 murder of a Palestinian who
had collaborated with the Israeli military.
</P>
<P>
   The Aqra family story is one of armed resistance against the
Israelis, of prison sentences, of violence, and of suffering. She
has four sons and five daughters. All four of her sons have been in
and out of Israeli prisons for much of their lives. For most of the
last 15 years, she has spent her weekends visiting prisons.
</P>
<P>
   She is proud of what she calls ``their service in the armed
struggle for Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a patriot,'' she said proudly, beaming at her son.
</P>
<P>
   Wa'el and his brothers were part of an underground police force
for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah political party
throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Wa'el's return home finally
unites the long fractured family.
</P>
<P>
   Wa'el's brother Ahed, 29, watched as his brother waved to people
lining the streets and honking car horns in support of the released
prisoners. He said he was very happy to see his brother, but
reflected on all the sacrifice and all the violence. ``All that we
have done, it wasn't worth it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed his deep cynicism about the Palestinian Authority
in which he worked for three years as a police officer in security
services but saw many people who fled the intifada come home to
better jobs in the Palestinian Authority. He said he is infuriated
daily by the fact that Palestinians still live under nearly
complete Israeli control. He still can't see his sisters who live
in Gaza because Israel does not permit open access between the West
Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that struggle, all those years in prison for this? What do
we have to show for it all?'' he asked.

   Amid the shouting of the handful of Israeli protesters at the
Israeli checkpoint, Dov Kalmanovitz, 42, stood like a ghost of the
victims of past violence. His face is still badly disfigured from
the burns he suffered when a Palestinian militant threw a molotov
cocktail in his car as he was returning to his home in the Israeli
settlement Beit El in January 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He was there in protest, standing off to the side of the
families hugging the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not here as a political movement, but as one person. And
I want to say that the release of these people shatters the
morality of our justice system,'' he said. ``They are criminals and
they should have to pay for what they did.''

MAYOR JENNINGS URGES CONGRESS TO APPROVE GUN CONTROL BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Albany, N.Y., Mayor Jerry Jennings joined dozens of
mayors from across the country Thursday at a rally on the steps of
the U.S. Capitol to urge Congress to approve gun control
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The mayors, who were joined by dozens of police officials and
mostly Democratic lawmakers, said they strongly support legislation
that would require that guns be equipped with safety locks and that
background checks be conducted on people who purchase firearms at
gun shows. The bill would also ban high-capacity ammunition clips,
which allow rifles to be modified into high-powered assault weapons
that can fire several rounds of bullets in a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the measures in May as part of a larger
juvenile justice bill. The House passed its own juvenile justice
bill in June, but that legislation did not contain any gun control
measures. Later, a separate gun control bill was defeated in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   However, lawmakers from both chambers of Congress began meeting
on Thursday in an attempt to reconcile the differences between the
juvenile justice bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a common sense solution,'' Jennings said in an
interview. ``It's nothing draconian. The NRA (National Rifle
Association) has got to get the message.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has vigorously lobbied against the gun control measures
and is credited with defeating the House gun control bill.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has said it is
unlikely the House will accept the Senate gun control measures as
they are currently written and that they will have to be weakened
if a deal is to be reached. Hatch is one of the key negotiators
trying to resolve the differences between the Senate and House
juvenile justice bills.
</P>
<P>
   But Jennings and the other mayors hope they can convince House
lawmakers to accept the Senate gun control provisions, which they
say are supported by a majority of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Thursday showed 90
percent of the people polled favor background checks at gun shows
and 79 percent favor equipping guns with safety locks. The poll
also showed that 70 percent of people who identified themselves as
Republicans also favored these gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a slippery slope that is going to take away
people's guns,'' said Paul Helmke, the Republican mayor of Fort
Wayne, Ind. ``It's saying let's use some common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings and Albany Deputy Police Chief Jack Nielsen met
Thursday with Reps. Michael McNulty, D-N.Y., and John Sweeney,
R-N.Y. to discuss the gun provisions.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty said on Thursday that he favors the Senate gun control
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney voted to support the House gun control bill _ which was
less strict than the Senate gun proposals _ but that legislation
was ultimately defeated by mostly Democratic members who favored
stronger measures.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings and the other mayors also attended a White House event,
where President Clinton announced a $15 million federal gun
buy-back plan while urging the House to go along with the Senate
gun control bill.
</P>
<P>
   The buy-back initiative would give police departments up to
$500,000 to purchase guns in and around public housing projects for
a suggested price of $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every gun turned in through a buy-back program means
potentially one less tragedy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House estimates the program will bring in close to
300,000 guns. The plan is modeled on local programs used in New
York and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The District of Columbia bought 2,306 guns during a two-day
offer last month at a price of $100 per gun. That
no-questions-asked program took in guns from across the city, not
only from neighborhoods near housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Washington program, the national buy-back offer would
not include amnesty for any crimes committed with the guns.
District of Columbia police are currently running ballistics tests
on the 2,306 guns to see if any of them match to crimes committed.

GORE HEADS FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUSH STOOD UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Displaying a nimbleness not normally seen in his
presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore Friday morning will
visit the same Rhode Island elementary school where Governor George
W. Bush of Texas left about 150 schoolchildren disappointed on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The children at the Ella Risk Elementary School in Central Falls
were sitting shoulder to shoulder on the floor of the gymnasium
Wednesday when they were told that Bush's plane was delayed from
New Hampshire and he would not be coming to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   With education a top issue for each of the presidential
candidates, Bush caught flak for canceling the school visit but
still attending a $1,000-a-head fund-raiser in Providence. He was
also criticized by New Hampshire Democrats for using schoolchildren
as political props during a trip to the Peter Woodbury Elementary
School in Bedford, N.H. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat, invited Gore to visit the
children, many of whom had been looking forward to meeting their
first presidential candidate. Gore is squeezing in the trip on his
way to New Hampshire, where he will be talking about long-term
health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore will be there regardless of the weather,
rain or shine,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary. ``He's
made education the top priority of his campaign and he'll look for
every opportunity to meet with kids, teachers, and parents.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the Bush campaign noted that Governor Lincoln Almond
of Rhode Island visited the school Thursday to make up for Bush's
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very interesting that the sitting vice president
is not only copying the governor's theme _ `prosperity with a
purpose' _ but is also copying his schedule,'' Bush spokeswoman
Mindy Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane retorted: ``The vice president's schedule is always more
responsive to kids than to cash. Apparently, the governor does not
follow that same principle.''

BORING AND MORE BORING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley made it
official Wednesday that he is running for president. The earth did
not move.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley hopes to win the Democratic nomination by being the
unClinton in the 2000 primaries, in which he will be the only
alternative to the president's sidekick, Vice President Al Gore.
But that's a competition between a boring candidate and an even
more boring candidate, and so far hardly anyone has stayed awake
long enough to care much.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are weary of the long-running, tumultuous Clinton saga
and are taking it out on Clinton's loyal lieutenant. The fatigue
factor is influencing national polls that consistently show Gore
trailing the Republican frontrunner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. In
a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, 53 percent of those
surveyed said they were ``just plain tired'' of Clinton. In a trial
heat, Bush creamed Gore, 56 percent to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But so far Bradley, 56, doesn't benefit much from that
particular Gore problem. He doesn't come within hollering distance
of the vice president with the Democrats who count. The same
Post-ABC poll shows Gore leading Bradley by 69 percent to 24
percent among Democrats likely to vote in the primaries. That lead
has remained constant since early last spring, when Bradley began
making serious presidential noises.
</P>
<P>
   Voters may have their doubts about Gore's leadership abilities
but at least they have heard of him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, out of public sight and mind since he quit the Senate
in 1996, is largely an unknown figure outside inner Democratic
political circles and the world of basketball, where he was once a
star. That may not be a total disadvantage, since as a senator he
had a reputation for being an even more boring speaker than Gore.
Both men are uncommonly cerebral for politicians and both suffer
from the compulsion to prove it until our eyes glaze over.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bradley has raised $12 million for his campaign, far
short of Gore's $20 million but still a heroic achievement for a
guy taking on the establishment favorite. He has spent a great deal
of time campaigning in New Hampshire, which holds the first
primary, and it has paid off with two recent local polls indicating
he is running only a few percentage points behind Gore there.
</P>
<P>
   And he has settled on a strategy that demands more than sounding
a theme of Anybody-But-Gore. He is coming at the veep from the
left. This is not a good position from which to run a general
election campaign, but it may stir up the animals in the Democratic
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Republicans turned the liberal label into a political
downer, President Clinton has labored mightily _ and with
considerable success _ to reposition his party in the philosophical
middle. But Bradley believes that true liberals are still out
there, hiding in the weeds, waiting for a new savior.
</P>
<P>
   And he has demonstrated some courage. He is the only
presidential candidate in either party to unequivocally support
teaching evolution as the dominant scientific theory explaining the
rise of different species _ without adding political baloney about
balancing it with creationism as though the literal interpretation
of the Bible carries the same weight. He alone is not bothering to
pander to the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley's positions are nearly as mushy as Bush's. He says
he will get into the sticky details later, a promise Bush has also
made. For the moment, he is offering soothing generalities that do
not provoke the controversies stirred up by Gore's much more
specific policy pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Bradley is counting on the character issue to carry
the day, although Gore's own personal conduct is as pristine as
Clinton's is dark. In politics, guilt by association may not be
fair, but it can be lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's liberal credentials are genuine. He may be flaunting
them now for a new purpose, but his Senate record indicates he is
no Bill Come Lately. The Republican National Committee responded to
the formal opening of his campaign by charging that he is recycling
the ``old ideas'' of the left. Indeed, his lifetime liberal voting
rating by Americans for Democratic Action, which monitors such
things, is 90 percent, only slightly behind Sen. Edward Kennedy's
95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To make the most of his political absence the past three years,
Bradley is also peddling the notion that he is an outsider more
attuned to real America than the sinful ways of Gore's Washington.
This works only if you forget that he was a senator for 17 years
and presumably played the insider game the same way everyone else
does.
</P>
<P>
   He should junk this approach. It is intellectually dishonest. At
least with Al Gore, you know what you get _ and it's pretty solid
stuff.

TUSSLE OVER GUNS WITH NO SHOTS FIRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, Sept. 16)  
(dw) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps, I suggested to this NRA member, he admires the artistry
in an antique gun. Or maybe he appreciates the mechanics of a
modern one. No, he said, those aren't his reasons. He wants guns
for hunting and for self defense and he intends to never give them
up.
</P>
<P>
   This man has owned guns for probably 40 years, since he was a
kid and was given his grandfather's. I don't have guns in the house
and agree with folk singer Cheryl Wheeler whose answer to American
violence is ``take away the guns.''
</P>
<P>
   But this man and I are both afraid. Because he is afraid he
wants his guns. Because I am afraid I don't want a gun and I'd be
relieved if others didn't either.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Margerison, who leads the Oat Valley Baptist Church in
Cloverdale, Calif., describes himself as ``an independent,
fundamental Baptist,'' adding, ``You probably can't get more far
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up on a farm he often cut school to go rabbit hunting.
He likes setting up pop cans and doing target practice. Plinking,
he calls it. Sometimes when he and the family are having a barbecue
they do a little plinking, he says, explaining, ``There's a science
to it. You have to consider the wind, the distance. It's
competitive. And it's relaxing.''
</P>
<P>
   I've never plinked and am voluntarily ignorant about guns. When
Roger mentioned his son's new single-shot 22-bolt action I just
nodded. I used the term ``assault weapon'' at one point and he
stopped and asked me what I meant by that.
</P>
<P>
   I had to say, ``I don't know. The big kind of movie gun.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the term is used too liberally as a propaganda label
for anything that shoots. The only thing I know about guns is that
every recent blood bath was accomplished with one or several. I
don't know what part of gun control would work but it seems like we
have lost our sanity around guns. Guns weren't always sexy. People
didn't always talk of blowing someone away or taking someone out.
Every child who commits suicide or shoots up a school makes people
like me cry for someone to get rid of the guns, whether they're in
someone's hall closet or being sold on the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Never happen, says Roger.
</P>
<P>
   I am not of the gun world. My father didn't own a gun. My
husband doesn't. My sister in Massachusetts doesn't have a gun but
I imagine some of my Pennsylvania relatives still hunt. It is
reported that everyone from soccer moms to computer whizzes are
arming themselves in California and that gun sales are up 30
percent from a year ago. But my California friends, as far as I
know, don't have guns, except for one avid hunter. Parents I know
with little kids don't let them have toy guns. A friend who used to
be a cowgirl once carried a rifle just like she wore cowboy boots,
but she's into something else now.
</P>
<P>
   I think guns in homes are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Roger believes, ``A home is safer with a gun than without.''
</P>
<P>
   So, this gun debate is very personal. And after that it gets
political.
</P>
<P>
   I think there ought to be a way to allow sports people to
continue their hobby but end the adolescent Ramboism that is
mistakenly identified as a right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Roger was a Marine and cries when he sings patriotic songs. ``I
would never take up arms against my country,'' he says. ``I fought
for my country.'' But the possibility is there, he says, and
mentions the Waco controversy in which federal agents are suspected
of starting the fire that killed 76 cult followers in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He fears that if his name were on a list of gun owners that some
day the government would come and take his guns away. When I ask
how many guns he owns he won't give me a number.
</P>
<P>
   He believes it is the goal of ``some in the government to remove
firearms from private homes,'' and that the underlying purpose of
gun control laws is to add a new one every year until guns are
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   He says it's his duty to protect his family and were he to dial
911 the police response time to his house would be 15 to 20
minutes. ``If someone breaks into my house with a gun or a knife
they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   This has never happened. He knows of one person who used a gun
on someone who was breaking into his house. That was in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   I ask if being a gun owner is inconsistent with being a preacher
and he pulls out the Bible and reads from Luke to show that two
disciples of Jesus carried swords. ``Jesus said if youlive by the
sword you die by the sword, but he never said don't carry the
sword.''
</P>
<P>
   That was it. I met the other side and no shots were fired. I
don't agree with him but I think I understand him better which is
something in this hugely polarized issue. He said it was nice
talking because ``my side tends to demonize yours.'' He gives me
some NRA literature and we shake hands.

A.J. FOYT RETURNS TO STOCK CAR RACING 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 THE LEDGER, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A.J. Foyt does not have a car. He doesn't have a driver. He has
not named a crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   He does have a major sponsor and a big name.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Foyt is the only driver in history to have won the Indy
500, the biggest event in open-wheel racing, and the Daytona 500,
the most important stock car race, and LeMans, the crown jewel of
sports car racing.
</P>
<P>
   With financial backing from Conseco, which also sponsors his
Indy Racing League team, Foyt has announced he is getting back into
stock car racing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a late start, Foyt says he'll be ready for next
February's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't really the question, though. The question is whether
Foyt has jumped into water that's over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt's first major hire was Waddell Wilson, who, like Foyt, was
at the top of his game during the '60s and '70s when his engines
powered Cale Yarborough and others to the top.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Wilson, who will be general manager of Foyt's
team, has bounced around a bit without much success.
</P>
<P>
   When Foyt and Wilson were at their best, stock car racing was a
very different sport. What worked then won't come close to working
now. While Foyt realizes that, one wonders if he is aware just how
much the sport has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt has never been involved, fulltime, in stock car racing.
When he came over it was just for a race or two in what was then
the best equipment available, like the Wood brothers' Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   While Foyt may have the money and the facilities, whether he'll
have the know-how is something else again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's very tough. I know it's more sophisticated now,''
Foyt said. ``This is a new team, but we're going to try and get
people who have won, try and put the best car we can with the best
aerodynamics out there.''
</P>
<P>
   If Foyt is to be competitive, who he hires will be the key.
There are only a few drivers, engineers and crew chiefs out there
who truly understand what it takes to make a Winston Cup car go
fast, but most of them have jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, there were more good drivers than there were cars.
Now, it's turned around,'' Wilson said. ``But there's still no
magic to it. It's a matter of getting good people and putting them
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt's team is going slow in its search for a driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have one with experience,'' Foyt said. ``But I'd
rather have a driver who's a little naive as long as I know he's
willing to go forward, stick his foot in it even if he has an
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt said he is in this for the long haul. So is Conseco, which
has given him a four-year deal.

PBS DOCUMENTARY DETAILS LIVES OF AN INTERRACIAL FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without a doubt, someone, somewhere will call ``An American Love
Story'' an ``important'' film. If it opens eyes to the invidious
racism all around us, it certainly is that.
</P>
<P>
   But is it an enjoyable film?
</P>
<P>
   Depends on one's definition of enjoyment, and perhaps on one's
own voyeuristic needs.
</P>
<P>
   The peeping tom in each of us is always ready for a little
thrill. Lifting the curtain on something we aren't normally privy
to is titillating, exhilarating, even enlightening. But where some
are happy to go home after a glimpse of the forbidden fruit, others
insist on settling in for the long haul and gathering enough fruit
for a few pies and maybe a compote for later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Jennifer Fox is that type. She and
soundwoman/co-producer Jennifer Fleming lived with the Wilson-Sims
family of Queens, N.Y., for a year and a half, bunking on the floor
of the daughters' bedroom to make ``An American Love Story,'' a
10-hour documentary series that marks the swan song of PBS'
``American Playhouse'' after an 18-year run.
</P>
<P>
   The film was prompted by Fox's experiences in the early '90s
when she was in a relationship with an African-American man. Fox,
who is white, was stunned by the overt racism they encountered. She
set out to find an interracial couple willing to share their lives
with the rest of the nation, or at least the portion that watches
PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Fox found Karen Wilson, a corporate human resources manager, and
Bill Sims, a blues musician. Wilson is white, Sims is black. They
have two daughters, Cicily Wilson and Chaney Sims. The daughters
are now adults; Cicily was 20 and Chaney 12 when Fox was filming in
1992 and '93. The lag time between shooting and making it to air
was taken up with securing funding for post-production and
distilling a thousand hours of footage down to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is eager to point out that ``An American Love Story'' is her
version of reality, and not necessarily anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally do not make a huge distinction between a
documentary and fiction,'' Fox said recently. ``I think we have to
acknowledge that all film is a kind of fictionalization because the
reality is I shot 1,000 hours of the Wilson-Simses' lives. That is
a minute number of hours in their real life, of that 18 months.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, we are left to contemplate how important ``An
American Love Story'' really is, because, just as with an
entertainment contrivance like MTV's ``The Real World,'' the scenes
that lack dramatic impact _ those everyday moments that don't fit
into a traditional story with beginning, middle and end _ never
make it to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   What we're left with, then, is Fox's subjective view of a blip
on the Wilson-Sims radar screen. Admittedly, it's a big blip,
encompassing a number of family dramas, including Karen's decision
to have a hysterectomy; Cicily's experiences at a mostly white
college and her semester abroad in Nigeria; Bill's battle to make
it in the music world and with his addiction to alcohol; Chaney's
first ``date,'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's triumph is in providing insights into interesting people,
particularly the enigmatic Bill Sims, a dour, distant man with two
personas: ``home'' and ``away.'' The commitment that Bill and Karen
have to their marriage and their family is nothing short of
inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Combining cinema verite with interviews and voice-overs, Fox has
less success conveying cause-and-effect relationships. Cicily, for
instance, struggles with her identity as a person of mixed-race
background, feeling she doesn't seem to fit in either the white
world or the black. But the viewer never sees the incidents or
encounters that prompt these sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to imply that Cicily is making it all up. It simply
shows how a documentarian can't always massage a story to achieve
the desired effect. For nosy nellies, that may not matter, but for
anyone contemplating a 10-hour investment in ``An American Love
Story,'' it's a dramatic reminder that fiction is often more
enjoyable than fact.
</P>
<P>

the life of an interracial family in Queens, N.Y. Produced by

PETTY: A NEW COMMITMENT TO WINNING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It has been a struggle at Petty Enterprises this year. It always
is when a team tries to reinvent itself, and that's what one of the
oldest names in stock car racing is trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Petty Enterprises turned out winning race cars with
almost monotonous regularity. Through most of the '60s and '70s, it
was the dominant team in racing, rising to the top with the backing
of Chrysler's Plymouth division and producing the sport's first
true superstar in Richard Petty.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Petty retired after the 1992 season, the
performance of Petty Enterprises had fallen off. Essentially, the
Pettys hadn't changed but racing had, leaving them behind.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, Petty Enterprises has made a new commitment
to winning.
</P>
<P>
   The effort moved into high gear this season when Kyle Petty
fully integrated his team with that of his father's. The new look
will continue in 2000 when STP, the main sponsor of Richard Petty's
car for 29 years, leaves after the Fourth of July race at Daytona
and gives way to General Mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Petty Enterprises is not the same as it was a year ago,'' said
John Andretti, who drives Richard Petty's No. 43.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a family operation anymore. I don't know the
exact number, but we've probably got 100 people working here now,''
Andretti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing the things it takes to win,'' he said. ``We've got
the people we need, the engineering, the right pieces. Kyle coming
on board was a big help, even if it hasn't shown up that much on
the track, yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought a lot to the team, he just didn't bring any cars,
so we were kind of behind there for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Petty's move was like starting over. Almost everyone who
worked on his car was released at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you do something new, there's always a wave,''
Andretti said. ``But now we have something we can build on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the nice thing is, it's still a family atmosphere,'' he
said. ``Richard has time for everybody. You can walk into his
office and talk about anything anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuing rejuvenation of Petty Enterprises has stabilized
the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti, who worked on a handshake basis with no formal
contract, has reportedly signed on for three more years, taking him
out of the rumor mill that had him tied to a number of other teams.
He said it was flattering to be mentioned in connection with Robert
Yates and others, but he has no plans to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we're building something here and I'd be foolish to
leave,'' said Andretti, who left the Petty team in 1994 and
returned in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of loyalty at Petty Enterprises. Richard's been
through it all and he knows what it's like,'' he said. ``When
people leave here, they're always trying to come back. That's the
way I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti had his first win for Petty Enterprises this year in
April at Martinsville, Va. Given what's happening, it was, he
hopes, only the first of many.

POLICE REVAMP BRINGS OUTCRY FROM PRO-BRITISH PROTESTANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ Pro-British Protestants Thursday denounced a proposal
to revamp, rename and downsize Northern Ireland's police force, all
while quadrupling the number of Catholic officers over the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Some Catholic nationalists also denounced the report, saying it
offered only cosmetic change. But others suggested it may be time
to put aside Catholics' historic hostility toward the police and
change the institution from within.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiling 175 recommendations aimed at making a police force
that is 92 percent Protestant more acceptable to a population that
is 43 percent Catholic, Chris Patten, chairman of the Independent
Commission on Policing, said the report offered ``a new beginning''
for an organization that has been at the center of the conflict in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic nationalists see the Royal Ulster Constabulary as
biased against them and an instrument to maintain the privileged
status of Protestant unionists. Protestants see the force as the
only thing that kept the IRA from wiping them out or forcing the
Northern Island into the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a police service that commands the respect of both
sides is essential for long-term peace and stability, many here
believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We propose in this report a transformation of policing that is
an integral part of the process of transforming Northern Ireland,''
said Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong. ``If this is
not the way forward, I simply do not know what is.''
</P>
<P>
   Patten dismissed suggestions by unionists that the
recommendations, which include changing the force's name to the
Northern Ireland Police Service and scrapping other symbols that
Catholics find offensive, would effectively disband the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are transforming the RUC, not disbanding it,'' said Patten.
</P>
<P>
   But David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, the biggest
party in Northern Ireland, said the report amounted to a
``gratuitous insult'' to Protestants and to the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, especially to the memory of the 302 officers killed
by paramilitary groups in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble called the report ``the most shoddy piece of work I have
ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that the force's 11,400 fulltime officers
be scaled back to 7,500 over the next ten years, and it calls for
hiring one Catholic for each Protestant during that same period.
Combined with early retirement packages, Patten said that would
double the number of Catholics in four years and make them account
for more than 30 percent of the force in ten.
</P>
<P>
   Many Protestants see this as pushing them aside to accommodate
those who used violence to try to destroy the police and the state.
Some unionists vowed to stage a campaign to simultaneously save the
Royal Ulster Constabulary and destroy the Good Friday Agreement of
1998 that led to the police review.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign of a mutiny within the police force itself,
however. Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said his officers did not
like everything in the report but did not view it as an insult. If
the proposed changes made the police acceptable throughout the
community, Flanagan said, ``then this is a hurt we have to
endure.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary officers seem resigned to the proposals, even if
many don't like them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change has to come,'' said Nigel Lindsay, a detective. ``I'm
not afraid of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Patten acknowledged that the dramatic demographic change could
occur only if Catholic nationalist leaders urge young people in
their community to put aside their longstanding distrust of the
police and join.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's imperative that Catholic, nationalist and
republican politicians and leaders get off the fence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were hints that some of them will. Seamus Mallon, deputy
leader of the moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party, which
represents most Catholics, said the report offered ``a new and
golden opportunity'' for nationalists to help create a police
service that would command their respect.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein, political allies of the IRA, gave a more cautious
response, saying it wanted to study the report in more detail. But
many here saw Sinn Fein's decision not to reject the report out of
hand as a hopeful sign.
</P>
<P>
   Some nationalists, however, dismissed the proposed changes as
cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've changed the name, but maintained the status quo,''
said Peter Montgomery, a community worker in the Markets, a
republican enclave in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the recommendations seek to normalize the police force
here, one of the most heavily armed in the world. They call for
replacing anonymous patrols in armored cars with beat cops, and for
abandoning heavily-fortified police stations for less intimidating,
more welcoming buildings. The section on community policing calls
for officers to be assigned to the same area for up to five years,
to were their names on their uniforms, and for structured meetings
with area residents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recommendations on creating partnerships between
police and the public draw on Massachusetts' experience with
community policing, such as the work of the Ten-Point Coalition in
Boston that involved black ministers helping to reduce youth
violence. Kathleen O'Toole, the former Massachusetts secretary of
public safety, is one of the eight commission members and an author
of the report.
</P>
<P>
   While the commission's recommendations are not binding, and many
cannot be put into effect unless paramilitary groups' cease-fire
holds and the stalemate over the creation of a local government is
broken, the British government has vowed to implement the report it
commissioned 15 months ago under the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement is threatened by the refusal of the Ulster
Unionists to form a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein until
the IRA begins disarming. Patten's proposals would guarantee Sinn
Fein two seats on a 19-member board that is proposed to oversee the
new police service.
</P>
<P>
   Patten said that many recommendations, such as eliminating the
British symbols and oath to the British monarch that have deterred
Catholic nationalists from joining the police, can be implemented
immediately. But he acknowledged that civilian oversight of the
police can only be put in place if the dispute over forming a
power-sharing cabinet is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policing in Northern Ireland has suffered, often with
disastrous consequences, from being a political issue, and from
being associated with the dispute about the state itself,'' said
Patten. ``We believe that it is possible to find a policing
solution to the policing problem, but only if you take the politics
out of policing.''
</P>
<P>
   As hard as handing Hong Kong back to the Chinese was, Patten
said overseeing the police review was ``the most difficult and
gruelling job I have ever done.'' The commission held public
meetings attended by more than 10,000 people across Northern
Ireland, received 2,500 written submissions, and met with
criminologists and police departments in Europe, South Africa and
North America, including Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That consultation process produced one of the more surprising
findings in the report. O'Toole said the commission had wanted to
ban the use of plastic bullets, which police here use to control
riot situations, and which have killed two dozen people, including
children. When asked what they would do if confronted by people
throwing petrol bombs at them, other police departments, including
Boston's, said they would fire live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to recommend scrapping (plastic bullets) in the
worst way, but we could not find alternatives for them in those
situations,'' said O'Toole.
</P>
<P>
   For some, like Jim McCabe, whose wife Nora was killed by a
plastic bullet, the recommendations seem like nothing more than a
cosmetic change. For others like Kathleen Ferguson, whose son
Michael, a police officer, was shot dead by the IRA as he walked a
beat in 1993, the report seems like a capitulation to the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``What good will come from changing a name?'' she asked.

DESIGN REVIEW: AN ERA'S HAUT MONDE FASHION, JUST AS INGRES
REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not only did the French painter
Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780-1867) turn out masterly
portraits, he was also a gifted fashion reporter. No detail of
with-it couture escaped his eye, from the viewer-friendly
decolletage of the loud-patterned silk evening gown worn by Madame
Moitessier, who posed for him in 1856, to the blue satin bows and
marabou feathers that enhanced the coiffure of the Princesse de
Broglie (painted 1853). To gowns, suits, jewelry, caps, shawls,
swords and shoes, he brought the same sharp focus as the
fashionable faces and bodies he painted.
</P>
<P>
   And so it suits him well (no pun intended) that the big show of
Ingres portraits opening Oct. 5 at the Metropolitan Museum should
be accompanied by ``Costume and Character in the Age of Ingres,''
an exhibition at the Met's Costume Institute that celebrates the
clothes admired and inspired by the artist. It's the first time the
Costume Institute has mounted an exhibition in conjunction with a
major loan show of paintings. And it's a great idea. A lively,
ambitious display of clothes for both genders, drawn entirely from
the Met's own collections, it plays to an obvious fact: that the
spirit of Ingres', or any, age is revealed through costume as well
as art.
</P>
<P>
   The show _ conceived by Richard Martin, director of the Costume
Institute, and assembled with the aid of acting curator Myra Walker
_ appropriately begins with underwear. The complex architecture of
elegant outer garments required real infrastructure, and an array
of delicately embroidered chemises, wasp-waist corsets _ including
a man's belly bracer _ pantaloons, sleeve supports and crinoline
hoops reveals how interior garments helped shape the exaggerated
silhouettes of the period. (One of the corsets allows for nursing:
lacing on the left side facilitates its lowering just enough to
give an infant access.)
</P>
<P>
   Upscale women had to change their clothes several times a day:
for activities at home, for social visits and for dinner. A
stunning parade of day dresses, ranging in style from the
column-slim Empire gowns of the century's early years to the
full-skirted extravaganzas with nipped-in waists and puffy sleeves
of the 1850s and '60s, shows the possibilities open to women of
taste and deep pockets. One strongly shaped American dress from
around 1835, in a burgundy silk compound weave, has a tight,
corseted bodice, with sleeves that puff out in midarm and then go
slim to the wrist, above a bell-shaped skirt that reveals the
ankles and a pair of lovely beaded shoes. It's a knockout among the
frilly silks and muslins that surround it.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast is a frou-frou American day dress of 1855 in
yellow silk brocaded with multicolor floss. Fringes abound: on its
capelet collar, huge tiered sleeves with wide, lacy wrist coverings
and a two-tiered skirt that bells out in soft folds. Not to be
overlooked, either, is a European dress of 1857 in multicolored
plaid silk (the popularity of plaid was undoubtedly due to Queen
Victoria's liking for Scottish tartans), with a heavily worked
bodice and large, loose capelet-type sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Male plumage was drabber, but it too had a complex social
language. One exhibit shows a dashing kind of civil uniform, a
bourgeois outfit with a stylishly skinny silhouette that took off
from a councilor-of-state getup like that portrayed in Ingres'
rendition of the foppish Comte de Pastoret (1826). The ensemble
here, designed to confer a touch of aristocracy, includes a fitted,
high-collared cutaway coat of black wool embroidered with black
silk floss (1824-1830), a white weskit embroidered in silk and gold
thread, a pair of very tight breeches and black shoes adorned with
bows. (By midcentury, breeches had been dropped for trousers,
signaling the true modernization of the Renaissance dress code.) A
sword and a high-crowned Napoleonic hat complete the ensemble. It
would look respectable at any 19th-century European court, but it's
a far fit from the robust, muscular figure that is the male ideal
today.
</P>
<P>
   What the haute monde wore for warmth was still meant to preserve
the fashionable silhouette. For milder weather, women could choose
from many breeds of shoulderwear, as the Costume Institute calls
it: shawls, mantelets, tippets, sacques, pelerines and visites
whose brilliant embroidery was inspired by Greek, Oriental and
Slavic motifs. (If you've always wanted to know what a tippet
looked like, here's your chance.) For more inclement days, women
wore pelisses, floor-length coats like the European model of 1825,
made of brown silk with puffed sleeves, tied with bows down the
front and augmented by a Paisley shawl.
</P>
<P>
   Although it offered little weather protection, a popular outdoor
garment for women in the early part of the century was the spencer
(presumably named for the Earl of Spencer), a short, pert cropped
jacket with a boyish look. It is shown here in three materials:
green silk taffeta, polychrome printed cotton and rust silk satin.
</P>
<P>
   For men, there were stagey ``Phantom of the Opera''-style cloaks
for wear at night, like the English garment on display of dark-blue
wool and silk camlet (1829-33) with a capelet and a long, full
skirt. Daytime might call for a carrick, a long coat _ exemplified
here by a French model from 1812 _ of beige wool broadcloth with
buttons down the front and a ruffly, many-tiered capelet topped by
a conventional collar. The dashing carrick stayed popular until
about 1850 when, as noted in a French magazine of 1852, it became
identified with mountebanks, coachmen and liveried servants.
</P>
<P>
   If opulence reared its head in daytime clothes, it positively
bloomed at night. Gowns of the type that appear in Ingres paintings
run from the Empire period in the early part of the century to the
fussy Rococo style of Empress Eugenie's Paris in the 1850s. Early
Empire dresses tended toward the bare and sheer, and were worn no
matter what the weather, like the wisp of an 1810 French evening
number on view, in white muslin decorated with silver tinsel.
Deeply decollete, with tiny puffed cap sleeves, it must have
entitled its wearer to many a shiver in winter.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, a grand French ball gown of 1847-48 is almost a
coverup. Of luxurious, light blue Chine silk in a multicolor floral
pattern, it has a modestly revealing neckline, with puff sleeves
fringed in gold. A nipped-in, vestlike bodice and a full flowing
skirt complete the ensemble, which in its extravagance recalls
Ingres' depiction of Madame Moitessier's finery.
</P>
<P>
   A lone man's outfit is shown in this display, dating from the
late 1830s to the early 1840s. Of black wool, it has a
tight-fitting cutaway jacket, designed for a nipped-in waist
achieved with the help of a corset, and skinny fly-front pants
replacing the once-customary breeches. Alas, it represents the last
pronounced silhouette in men's wear before it lapsed into the
blocky, body-concealing construction carried down to present-day
suits.
</P>
<P>
   This engaging show is enhanced by the use of French furniture, a
display of period jewelry, a cluster of carte-de-visite photographs
by their inventor, Andre-Adolphe-Eugene Disderi showing upscale
subjects and their finery, and fashion plates from periodicals and
books. As shows go, it wears its learning lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Costume and Character in the Age of Ingres'' remains at The
Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 81st Street, (212)
989-5500, through Nov. 21.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. House of Representatives voted
overwhelmingly Thursday to condemn President Clinton's clemency
offer to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists linked to a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   The House said the clemency deal ``sends the unmistakable
message to terrorists that the United States does not punish
terrorists in the most severe manner possible under the law, making
terrorism more likely and endangering every American.'' The
criticism came in a non-binding resolution approved by a 311-41
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators and leaders of a conservative law
enforcement group also criticized Clinton for seeking tighter gun
laws while, at the same time, offering clemency to Puerto Rican
nationalists who were convicted of gun-related violations.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a group news conference in front of the U.S.
Capitol, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said it was ``an abomination
of justice'' for Clinton to offer clemency to the members of the
FALN, the Puerto Rican independence group linked to bombings that
killed six people and wounded others in 130 bomb attacks in the
1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said the clemency deal shows the
president has a ``double standard.'' On the one hand, Clinton is
pressing for20more gun control laws, said Craig, but he also is
granting clemency to people who were convicted of firearms
violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That says a great deal to Americans,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Bryant Jennings, a 21-year veteran of the Memphis,
Tenn., police department, added that Clinton's decision ``is a slap
in the face to every hard working police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rollin Kiser, police chief in Marysville, Ohio, and a 33-year
law enforcement veteran, said criminals convicted of gun violations
should serve prison sentences and that there should be no
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of accountability. Kiser said. ``If you do the
crime, you do the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fotis, the executive director of the 65,000-member Law
Enforcement Alliance of America, a conservative police group that
opposes additional gun control laws, said Clinton was ``releasing
convicted terrorists for politically motivated reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans allege that the president's clemency offer was
designed to win support among New York's Hispanic voters for
Hillary Clinton's possible candidacy for a U.S. Senate seat. Law
enforcement groups and anti-crime advocates also have lambasted the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband first proposed the clemency offer Aug. 11, Mrs.
Clinton was silent but announced last weekend that she opposes it.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 Puerto Ricans were members of the Puerto Rican
nationalist group known as the FALN, based upon the Spanish acronym
for Armed Forces of National Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 16 members of the pro-independence Puerto Rican
organization was convicted of crimes stemming from attacks that
killed or injured people, according to deputy White House chief of
staff Maria Echaveste.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the nationalists have served at least 14 years for
crimes such as possession of an unregistered firearm, interstate
transportation of a stolen vehicle or seditious conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer of clemency would require the convicts not only
to accept traditional federal parole restrictions on travel but
also to sign a document pledging to renounce violence. Twelve of
the jailed militants have thus far accepted Clinton's offer, which
expires Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The law enforcement group, whose membership includes police
officers and crime victims, took out a four-page advertisement in
the Washington Times on Thursday to criticize Clinton's clemency
offer and the president's push for more gun laws. In the ad, the
group called the Puerto Rican nationalists ``violent terrorists
involved in bombing attacks that killed or maimed innocent
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement was signed by 2,200 law enforcement officials
from around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Others at the press conference included Sen. Rick Santorum,
R-Pa., Reps. Bob Barr, R-Ga., Roscoe Bartlett, R-Md. and Virgil
Goode, D-Va.

 &HT;    Illustrator gives Harry dimension
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Mary Grandpre was handed the awesome task of
determining exactly how an 11-year-old wizard named Harry Potter
would look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was like any other job _ one time, one cover,''
says the 45-year-old free-lance illustrator, who never dreamed the
book would become a worldwide phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   She will eventually illustrate all seven books planned for the
popular series. She recently completed a portrait of Harry for a
Nickelodeon magazine cover that may be turned into a poster.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpre, who lives in St. Paul, Minn., was selected by
Scholastic, the American publisher of the Harry Potter books. A
different illustrator is responsible for the British versions of
the books.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpre has never met or spoken to author J.K. Rowling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The publisher is the go-between, and they don't want us to get
together because we'll muddy each other's waters,'' she explains.
``I've heard she likes my illustrations, which makes me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic had seen six children's books Grandpre had
illustrated and called to request a style they'd seen in one of
them. Grandpre describes that style as ``soft, surreal fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a slightly disheveled Harry in the midst of an
exciting adventure, Grandpre's book jackets incorporate whimsical
symbols and characters from each book.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of years, Grandpre was represented by Centerville
artist agent Scott Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has great imagination, great design and a passion for the
arts,'' Hull says. ``I immediately recognized her work when I saw
Harry Potter. She can really bring things to life.''
</P>
<P>
   The bringing-to-life process begins with a careful reading of
the manuscript. ``The thing that grabs me as an artist about Harry
Potter is its magic, the character of Harry and how we kind of fall
in love with him,'' Grandpre says. ``I thought the book was really
rich, full of a lot of visual ideas, imaginative.''
</P>
<P>
   On a first reading, Grandpre typically marks up the text _
underlining and circling paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the book carefully, and as I'm reading the story I'm
listening to what the author has to say about his (Harry's)
physical looks and I try to picture this boy by the way she
describes his movements or the way he talks,'' Grandpre said.
</P>
<P>
   After presenting a few ideas to Scholastic's art director,
Grandpre began creating the ``couple of roughs with pencil and
tracing paper'' that eventually became the pastel-on-paper
wrap-around cover art. The original is ``about 18 inches high by 30
inches wide'' and took five days to create.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpre works in a studio that's been added to the back of her
1940s house in St. Paul. ``It still has enough charm to make me
happy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Though she is proud of her Harry Potter work and loves working
with the ``wonderful and supportive people at Scholastic,''
Grandpre says it's frustrating to become known for something
``that's different than what you really love to do in your heart.''
Her true love is illustrations that are ``a little more removed,
abstract, sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for the low-down on the next Harry Potter adventure,
Grandpre admits she doesn't have a clue, though it's certain she'll
be one of the first on this side of the ocean to know what magic is
in store for readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read the fourth Harry Potter book,'' Grandpre says.
``I know it's going to be a while.''

 &HT;    Wizard-in-training makes sales soar
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Don't be surprised if the print on this page
disappears after you've read it, or a large screech owl suddenly
swoops down and makes off with your newspaper. And don't be
unnerved if the portrait of author J.K. Rowling should come to life
off the book jacket and stroll over to the sketch of her best-known
character, who may then be inspired to climb on a broomstick and
head out the window.
</P>
<P>
   If all of this sounds far-fetched and impossible, then you're
obviously a Muggle and shouldn't be reading this story anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, it all sounds perfectly plausible or at
least intriguing, you may be destined to become a Harry Potter fan.
</P>
<P>
   You won't be alone. The 11-year-old wizard has successfully cast
his spell on both children and adults alike and has become a
regular on best-seller lists in America and abroad _ first in
``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' then in ``Harry Potter
and the Chamber of Secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   His third adventure, ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
Azkaban,'' arrived in bookstores Wednesday. The series is penned by
British writer Jo Rowling, who lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, and
was so poor when she began writing it that she couldn't afford to
make a photocopy of her manuscript and instead had to type it twice
on an electric typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   These days, J.K. Rowling's name is synonymous with magic,
delightful adventures and great fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the third book on reserve at the library,'' says
9-year-old Al Maurice of Centerville, whose mom labels him a ``book
eater.''
</P>
<P>
   Al's number of summer reading hours earned him the right to
place his bookmarks in his favorite library books. He chose the
Harry Potter book, which follow the adventures of a young wizard
and his friends, family and the ``Muggles,'' _ people without
magical powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the details,'' Al explains. ``They don't just say Harry
goes to wizard school, they tell you all about it and about the
forest around it. And I like the imaginary sport _ Quidditch _ they
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Stevens, 9, received the first book in the series as a
gift from his grandmother, Alberta Stevens, who says she heard
about Harry Potter via ``grandma war stories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when grandmas get together and talk about what their
grandchildren like,'' explain Alberta Stevens, who lives in
Columbus. ``Our librarian is also a grandma and she told me about
this wonderful series that the kids just adore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it the minute it came to be sure it was appropriate for
him and I thought it was delightful,'' she says. ``Values are part
of the story _ caring about other people, protecting, compassion.
Harry is a little kid's hero and they're hard to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel says he began to like the book ``toward the end of the
first chapter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wizard but he's not perfect,'' he says of the main
character.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Walt, professor of children's literature at
Massachusetts Bay Community College, says Boston bookstores opened
early Wednesday morning so that excited children could pick up the
new book before heading for school. She says that's happened in
other cities as well, including London, where the book has been
available for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   She isn't surprised at Potter's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flipped over it,'' she says. ``I was utterly taken with its
applicability to middle-school children. It addresses all the
issues those children are facing, especially feelings of
self-worth, competition, membership in a group. Underneath all the
adventure, it addresses their fears and reassures them that they're
going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt says even reluctant readers are ``gobbling up'' Harry
Potter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids like it because it has magic and kids this age still
believe in magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Adults apparently do as well.
</P>
<P>
   Randee Saldoff of Clayton has purchased Harry Potter books for
her father (age 91), her brother (age 58) and her son (age 20).
</P>
<P>
   Kathi Sweeterman, director of outside sales at Books &AMP; Co., gave
the book to her adult daughters and loves it herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was 11 years old again with 11-year-old friends
and mean grown-ups,'' says Sweeterman, whose store hosted a Harry
Potter event, serving up owl and unicorn cookies and ``cauldron
punch.'' There was also a Harry Potter lookalike contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both boys and girls like Harry,'' says Lisa Loftin, children's
librarian at branch of the Dayton and Montgomery County Library.
``He's an appealing character and he's not perfect so you identify
with him. Most kids probably look at their families sometime and
say 'I can't really belong to these people' and that's the
situation Harry is in.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Baumer, reference librarian at another local library
branch, said she's ``getting to be a fanatic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought the second book from England because we couldn't
wait,'' says Baumer, who enjoys reading the books to her
10-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being able to ham up a book and read all the character
voices and there are so many in these with good names like Snape,
the evil professor. It's really fun and unpredictable. You never
know what's going to happen next!''
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Low, a children's librarian, remembers receiving Harry as
a review book for the library system. ``That means I had to read it
and decide whether our library should purchase it or not,'' she
explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately fell in love with Harry and couldn't wait for
the second book to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only negative thing I can think of concerning the Harry
Potter books is that when a new one comes out, nothing else is
accomplished at my house until it's read!''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, a batch of showers and thunderstorms,
some with downpours, advanced northward along the very humid Middle
Atlantic Seaboard, far ahead of a cool front pressing slowly
eastward from the Appalachians. On Friday, the two systems will
merge over eastern and northwestern New England, setting the stage
for heavy rains. Moderate to locally heavy rain will douse much of
coastal New England as heavy showers and thunderstorms erupt as the
arriving cool front lifts humid air. Heavy rains are also possible
in the mountains of northwest New England, where lift will be
augmented as moist winds from the southeast are forced to rise over
the sloping terrain. Meanwhile, temperatures could dip into the
upper 40s across parts of the northern Great Lakes and southern
Ontario as intermittent rains form in response to a pool of
unstable, cold air centered near James Bay in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated but potentially powerful thunderstorms will develop
across parts of the southern Plains as increasingly moist air
starts to flow into Texas and Oklahoma. Severe weather may occur in
a few spots, mainly in west Texas, where a boundary separating dry
air to its west and more humid air to its east becomes established.
Farther north, the system that sparked unusual lightning in San
Francisco Wednesday night will move over the mountains of Wyoming,
sparking isolated thunderstorms. Tropical Storm Floyd will likely
intensify into a hurricane on Friday as it continues to move
west-northwest across the central Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Electric Night
</P>
<P>
   It was an electric night in San Francisco. From dusk on
Wednesday until dawn on Thursday, bright flashes of lightning
illuminated the night sky. The uncommon thunderstorms in the
normally tranquil Bay area had a connection to the tropics. A plume
of warm, moist air several thousand feet above the ground was drawn
from Tropical Storm Greg which was near southern Baja California.
At the same time, a pool of cool air arrived at 20,000 feet. The
resulting vertical temperature difference created a volatile
atmosphere that gave life to the thunderstorms by the Bay.

 &HT;    DANFORTH TO FOCUS ON 'DARK QUESTIONS' OF WACO CASE
 &HT;    Eds: Adds new graf 27 with Clinton comment.
 &HT;    740&AMP;add. With WACO-PROBE.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening an independent investigation of the 1993
FBI assault on a religious compound in Texas, former Sen. John
Danforth promised Thursday to answer the ``dark questions'' of the
Waco incident: ``Did the government kill people?'' and ``Was there
a cover-up?''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said core values of American democracy are at stake in
his inquiry into the deaths of 76 Branch Davidians and whether
federal officials lied and hid evidence after fire consumed the
sect's fortified home outside Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``If government covers things up, if government kills people, if
that's what happened _ and I don't prejudge that _ then that
undermines what (Thomas) Jefferson talked about as being the very
foundation of government,'' explained Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a big thing,'' said Danforth. ``I think that it
is very important to try to get answers to questions that are
important for the whole integrity of our government.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno announced Danforth's appointment as
the fulfillment of her pledge for an outside probe to finally ``get
to the bottom'' of the Waco controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Repubicans have been calling for Reno to resign
since the FBI belatedly disclosed that it had used military-issue
tear gas canisters on April 19, 1993, as the agency ended its
51-day seige of the Branch Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and other federal officials had denied for six years that
the devices, which use heat to disperse the tear gas, were used at
Waco. They still maintain that the Davidians, not the FBI, started
the deadly fires.
</P>
<P>
   Saying ``I don't run from controversy,'' Reno said Thursday she
would stay on the job. However, she said her duties will no longer
include matters relating to Waco because ``I will obviously be a
witness'' in Danforth's probe.
</P>
<P>
   With Reno recused, Danforth will deal with Deputy Attorney
General Eric Holder.
</P>
<P>
   The probe will focus on ``bad acts'' rather than ``bad
judgment,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country can survive bad judgment,'' he explained. ``But
the thing that really undermines the integrity of government is
whether there were bad acts, whether there was a cover-up, and
whether ... the government killed people.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said his investigation will answer those ``dark
questions,'' not second-guess ``judgment calls'' about the federal
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department orders that name Danforth a special
counsel authorize him to investigate specific areas:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether any government agents or officials lied or withheld,
altered or destroyed evidence about what went on at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether any government agents used incendiary devices or
engaged in gunfire at the Branch Davidian compound on April 19,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether government agents started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether there was any illegal use of U.S. military forces in
connection with the operation by federal law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The orders also call for ``public dissemination'' of the
findings ``to the maximum extent possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope and my intention that the facts that are
discovered will be made available to the American people, for that
is very, very important,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the special counsel is enpowered to convene a grand
jury and take testimony in private, if need be.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth also said in a televised interview Thursday that he
would have the power to prosecute individuals for criminal
wrongdoing if that became necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he does not know how long the investigation will
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it would be a mistake to set a fixed time
limit,'' he said. ``I can tell you that my goals are first of all
to be absolutely objective, and I go into this with no preconceived
ideas whatever. So I'm going to be totally, totally objective. I'm
going to call 'em as I see 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he will enlist investigators and attorneys from
outside government to conduct at least most of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that the FBI should be investigating the
FBI,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh issued a statement saying, ``I welcome
the attorney general's selection of Senator Danforth.''
</P>
<P>
   At an afternoon news conference, President Clinton also praised
the appointment. He said of Danforth, ``I have always thought him
an honorable man and an intelligent and straightforward man. The
only thing that I would ask is that he conduct a thorough and
honest inquiry and do it as promptly as he can so that we can get
the facts, take appropriate action, and go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said his chief deputy will be U.S. Attorney Edward Dowd
of St. Louis, ``a person who is very highly regarded in our
community, a very respected prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowd will leave his federal position and join Danforth's law
firm. A Democrat, Dowd was backed for his Justice Department
position by Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Waco investigation will be headquartered in St. Louis, where
both Danforth and Dowd reside.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders of several congressional committees have
declared their intent to hold hearings on the Waco incident and
will likely be calling the same witnesses that Danforth will be
interrogating.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this would interfere with his probe, Danforth said,
``I'm not going to try to tell Congress what to do, or what not to
do, or what I think they should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the appointment, Reno said she had found the right
person for a tough job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to find someone with impeccable credentials,
someone with bipartisan support in Washington who is widely
regarded throughout the country, someone who is independent and
someone who has the wisdom and determination to do the job the
right way,'' she said. ``I have found that person in Senator John
Danforth.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, a three-term Republican senator from Missouri, also
served as that state's attorney general and is an ordained
Episcopal minister.

COMMENTARY: ISRAEL GETS CHEERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deep in our hearts there is pain, said the prime minister of
Israel. He spoke as his Cabinet voted to give the Arabs 7 percent
more of what the world calls the West Bank, Arabs call Palestine
and Israelis whose pain is deepest call Judea and Samaria. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Israeli Jews have grappled with the possibility
that Judea and Samaria would become a new Arab-ruled state called
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis on the left and center-left felt that was the only
road to peace. And since 1991, when the Labor Party created the
foundation of Palestine at Oslo, many other Israelis have felt a
sense of dread that they were losing the struggle against creation
of Palestine, and feared that it would endanger Israel's existence.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pain Prime Minister Ehud Barak spoke of crossed party lines.
But in the end it was overwhelmed by Israel's eagerness for peace,
an eagerness that became the Palestinians' great asset at
bargaining time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what has all the harsh Arab-Israeli negotiation and the Arab
terrorism been about, if so many Israelis, gladly or in fear,
accept the inevitability of Palestine? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mostly it was about these quintessential problems: buffer zones,
the future of Jerusalem, the armed strength of the new Palestine,
Arab incitement to hatred against Israel, water resources in a dry
part of the world, the return of the Palestinians who left their
homes when Israel was created and how that would change the
Arab-Jewish population balance. What would the answers do to
Israeli chances of existence, not for 10 or 20 years after the
peace treaty, but forever?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In May Israelis elected Barak, a Laborite who has a record as a
particularly brave soldier, and a man decent of mind and manner, to
bring a settlement as quickly as possible. His decision to resume
negotiations by turning over more land has made him cheered in a
world not given to cheering Israeli leaders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But _ still the problems and still no answers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody who does not choose to live in Israel can decide its
security strategy. And I hope that American and Israeli Jews who
may think that Barak is taking the wrong road _ concessions without
comparable security payment in advance _ will not do to him what so
many Labor people did to his conservative predecessor, Benjamin
Netanyahu. They tried to destroy him abroad, particularly in
America, with increasingly nasty propaganda. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, through their passion for nationhood, plus
terrorism and incitement to hatred, will have won their own country
_ provided they give answers to critical problems, which Israel can
accept with safety. And provided there is enough time for the
answers to be tested before Barak's settlement date of September
2000.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat could start by doing what he promised to do
publicly and in secret codicils at Wye in 1998 but somehow has not
carried out. He can, for instance, dismantle all terrorist
organizations politically, economically and militarily. He can live
up to his promise that the Palestinian police force be reduced to
the agreed 30,000, and armed like police, not a combat army. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or the promise about not taking important action unilaterally _
like the declaration of a Palestinian state he is still
threatening. And how about the pledge to give up incitement to
hatred, in public statements, propaganda and in schools?
Palestinian officials say they will get around to changing
anti-Jewish textbooks _ but give us a break, it will take time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Israelis' desire for peace is so strong now that they do not
seem to mind that their government did not give them a detailed
report on Palestinian ``compliance'' with Wye before handing over
that 7 percent. It raises the total of West Bank land under
Palestinian control to 40 percent. The big Palestinian push for
more land will come during final-settlement talks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, now the leader of the defeated Likud Party, has
some advice for Barak:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsible leadership of a nation does not pay off with
homeland territories, or with its security or with strategic assets
in order to improve its posture among the Egyptians, the Europeans
or anybody else.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think Barak understands, and that one day he will show he
does, before September 2000.

PACIFIC STOCK EXCHANGE MOVES TOWARD FOR-PROFIT STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGY RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Pacific Stock Exchange is asking members to
approve a proposal to transform its equities business into a
for-profit corporate unit, which managers believe will run far more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between running a corporation and running
a political party,'' Dale Carlson, the exchange's vice president
for corporate affairs, said Wednesday when the proposal was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Members have until Oct. 4 to cast their proxy votes on the
proposal. If approved, it would be forwarded to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and, with its approval, possibly implemented
before the end of the year, said Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   That would make the Pacific Stock Exchange the first U.S.
</P>
<P>
   securities market to move formally toward a for-profit corporate
structure.
</P>
<P>
   The PCX board of governors has approved the proposal, which
would ``demutualize'' the exchange's equities business and
reorganize it as a wholly owned corporate subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   This would be known as PCX Equities Inc., which PCX Chairman and
CEO Philip D. DeFeo said ``will be more nimble, more agile and more
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We are positioning our equities business to be able
to raise capital in the public market, which it cannot do now. It
will be cheaper and more accessible for retail and institutional
firms. And, it will be more attractive to potential strategic
alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   The equities business is one-third of the San Francisco-based
exchange's activity, with options representing two-thirds. That
business is unaffected by the proposal, said Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   PCX Equities Inc. would have a board of directors that would
function like any other corporate board, overseeing management of
the exchange, setting policies and governing the operations, said
Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   New agility would come from its corporate nature, and the
equities business is currently hampered by the membership
cooperative surrounding it, said Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now every time we want to change a rule, a practice, a
listing, an allocation, the dress code, it has to go through a set
of member committees,'' said Carlson. ``By putting that
decision-making responsibility in the hands of a management team,
we feel we will be able to move more quickly, implement changes
more quickly, respond more quickly to opportunities and challenges
that come up in the marketplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traders spend about $8,000 a month to lease seats on the
exchange from members and one must own or lease a seat to trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific, a not-for-profit membership organization, wants to
introduce permits that traders would lease directly from the
exchange for about $2,000 a month. Traders on the competing Boston
Stock Exchange, for example, don't have to pay anything to lease
seats to trade there.
</P>
<P>
   One seat owner was skeptical Thursday. ``I'm in favor of
spinning off the floor, but I'm not in favor of the equity trading
permits,'' said Paul Liang, who owns 49 of the exchange's 552 seats
and leases them to traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will result in the dilution of our seats. I have to wait
and read every detail before I decide one way or another,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If conversion to for-profit status is successful, the exchange
may consider raising money through a public offering or a private
placement, said Carlson. Both the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq stock market are considering public offerings.

ANTI-GAY POLITICIAN ACKNOWLEDGES HOMOSEXUAL AFFAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Michael Portillo, widely considered to have a very good
chance of becoming the next leader of Britain's Conservative Party,
astounded the country's political establishment on Thursday by
announcing that he had homosexual experiences in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say what I want to say,'' said Portillo, 46, addressing
in a newspaper interview the persistent rumors that he had sex with
other men while a student at Cambridge in the 1970s. ``I had some
homosexual experiences as a young person.''
</P>
<P>
   Portillo, who has been married for 17 years, served as defense
secretary under John Major and is seen as a formidable threat to
William Hague, the current Tory leader.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has no openly gay Conservative members of Parliament,
and only a handful of Labor ones. After a number of
sensationalistic, press-driven disclosures that several members of
the Labor Cabinet are gay, the country has in the last year gone
through some very public soul-searching as it struggles to come to
grips with how it feels about having homosexuals in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Because of some newspapers' love of sex-and-politics articles,
said Mark Watson, a spokesman for Stonewall, a gay-rights group, it
seemed inevitable that someone, sometime, would publicly reveal the
truth about Portillo's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he realized that if he wanted a future in politics, he
had to be honest about himself,'' Watson said. ``Either he was
going to jump, or somebody was going to push him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to say what effect the sudden disclosure will
have on the career of Portillo, who lost his parliamentary seat in
1997 and is poised to attempt a political comeback. The Tory party
is split between old-school Conservatives, like Lord Tebbit, a
former Cabinet minister, who believes that homosexuals should not
hold high-level government posts because they might ``do each other
favors,'' and a new guard, led by the party leader, Hague, who have
argued for more tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   In a signal, perhaps, of a new mellowness in the news media, The
Times of London _ which is owned by Rupert Murdoch and which
published the interview with Portillo, and which in any case
supports him because of his Euro-skeptic views _ on Thursday said
that the Tory party should stop scolding and start listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern Britons recognize that experimentation and exploration
are the natural experiences of youth and the path to eventual
fulfillment in relationships can be a winding one,'' The Times said
in an editorial. ``A public which instinctively appreciates that
affections cannot be legislated for is likely to prefer lawmakers
who are honest about the diversity of human experience rather than
those who are energetic in the pursuit of crusades.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun, another Murdoch paper and Britain's most popular daily
tabloid, put it another way. In a reference to longstanding rumors
that Portillo had been romantically involved with one of his
Cabinet colleagues, its headline read, ``Portillo: I Had Gay Sex in
Past, but I Never Had Fling With Peter Lilley.''
</P>
<P>
   Portillo's admission was shocking on a number of counts. In the
past he has always deflected the rumors about his homosexuality,
and he is reviled by many supporters of gay rights because of his
legislative record. As a member of Parliament, he opposed lowering
the homosexual age of consent to 16, from 18; as defense secretary,
he opposed allowing homosexuals to serve in the military.
</P>
<P>
   And Portillo's declaration comes at a sensitive crossroads in
his own career. Stunningly defeated in Labor's rout of the Tories
in 1997 _ his opponent, coincidentally, was openly gay _ he has
spent the last two years recovering, positioning himself for his
return, and, apparently, reconfiguring his political views. He is
now expected to seek his party's nomination for the Kensington and
Chelsea seat left vacant by the recent death of the prominent Tory
Alan Clark.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech after his defeat two years ago, he seemed to be
showing a new attitude toward moral issues, urging the Tories to
show tolerance for ``the diversity of human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Portillo is pleading for just that tolerance. ``I think if
I read this about someone else, my reaction would be, `So what,'''
he said. ``I hope that will be other people's reactions.''

GAZING IN A MIRROR: THE OMNIPRESENT CAMERA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(dal) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the age of mechanical reproduction, the hatred that dare not
speak its name may well be photophobia. In these image-saturated
times, even the most devout lovers of photography can succumb,
while acute sufferers may even long for heated discussions of ``the
death of photography.'' After all, if other forms of human
expression _ painting, sculpture, the novel _ are regularly
pronounced dead, why is photography exempt?
</P>
<P>
   Here, unfortunately, is why: Photography, you might say, is us.
A century and a half after its invention, it is less a ``form of
human expression'' than an inextricable part of the human condition
and contemporary landscape, something involuntary and inescapable,
almost like weather. It is no longer possible to catalog its uses
and applications, the fields of knowledge it has extended and the
doors of experience it has opened, not to mention the thrilling
tricks, illusions and visual manipulations it executes daily in
magazines and newspapers and on billboards. At the moment the
southeast corner of 26th Street and the Avenue of the Americas is
dominated by the spectacle of a towering image of a well-shod young
man scaling a brick wall that covers the side, also brick, of a
12-story building. It is an advertisement for shoes, but what
dazzles is the giant figure, the blend of real and depicted brick
and the way the building's actual windows become part of the image.
Photography permeates the social fabric, the media and cyberspace,
our very dreams. And it is the most omnipresent of all art forms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite talk of the rise of video or the return of painting or
the dominance of installation art, nothing in the last three
decades of art can match the triumph of photography. Since the late
1960s, when it was put into play by Conceptual Art, photography has
changed the history of art and infiltrated every other contemporary
art medium while diversifying exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   It has generated a sea change or two in art criticism and theory
as well. And it has demonstrated that it is as capable as any other
art medium of endless repetition and derivativeness, as suggested
by the plethora of snapshots that, in various sizes, pass for art
these days. An exhibition at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center offers
some respite from the onslaught of photography that in the
homeopathic tradition of treating like with like consists of more
of the same. ``The Promise of Photography: Selected Works From the
DG Bank Collection'' is a big, genial show of work dating from the
early 1960s to the present. Its nearly 300 images by 32 artists are
spread throughout the center's dozen ground-floor galleries with a
sense of spaciousness and order that feels unusual by today's
standards, when so many dense-packed photography installations seem
bent on mimicking the medium's saturation of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Selected from the DG Bank's enormous collection by Alanna Heiss,
P.S. 1's director, and Klaus Biesenbach, one of its curators, ``The
Promise of Photography'' seems like an attempt to clear the air
quietly, to loosely yet seriously chart the extraordinary range of
art photography without a hint of agenda, polemic or sensation.
</P>
<P>
   In a purely experiential sense, air, or open space, is something
that P.S. 1 has in quantity. There are rarely more than one or two
artists to a gallery, and the blank walls provide perceptual
intervals and pauses that enable each one's work to stand, or
occasionally fall, in isolation, although there are plenty of
connections and contrasts to be drawn if one is so inclined. The
effect is marvelously unforced and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   The works on view range from Marco Giacomelli's early 1960s
black-and-white photographs of exuberant clerics on ice skates,
their dark robes dramatically silhouetted against the snow, to
Magdalena Jetelova's overly contrived images of dark Icelandic
landscapes streaked with the white hot lines of a laser. In
between, the show runs the gamut from artifice to document and back
again. There are various kinds of street and landscape photography,
work from several generations of Conceptually inclined artists (Dan
Graham, Christian Boltanski, Dennis Adams, Candida Hofer) and
sundry examples of set-up photography. The most notable of these is
``Something More,'' Tracey Moffat's steamy Outback melodrama of
death, desire and derailed travel plans, a tale told in nine images
that combine over-the-top Technicolor with the silvers and grays of
film noir.
</P>
<P>
   The show is rife with the work of artists who have not had solo
shows in New York; the mysterious portraits and landscapes of Bill
Henson, who, like Ms. Moffat, is Australian, are a case in point.
And there are several younger artists, both known and unknown,
whose work reflects a new generation's embrace of the intuitive.
</P>
<P>
   The German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans is represented by a
wall scattered with his stylishly romantic images of his friends
and surroundings. Nearby the sculptor Gabriel Orozco tactfully
makes his presence felt with three color images that
characteristically blend the exotic and banal. And across the way,
the close-ups by the German artist Tamara Grcic zero in on the
details, mostly green, of a grocery store in Chinatown in New York.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It makes perfect sense that these newcomers share a gallery with
three color images from the 1970s by Helen Levitt, the great
photographer of New York street life whose work has done so much to
reveal the joys of the serendipitous encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heiss and Biesenbach seem to have deliberately avoided some
of the most obvious usual suspects, skipping William Wegman, Cindy
Sherman, Thomas Struth and Thomas Ruff, even though the collection
includes their work. And there are several surprises. Hanging
opposite the charming Giacomelli images are a series of
irresistibly antic images of Japanese children at play by Nobuyoshi
Araki, best known in New York for voyeuristic, sexually charged
scenes of scantily clad women. Considered against the background of
Araki's other work, the innocence of his photographs at P.S. 1 is
almost jarring.
</P>
<P>
   There are also invigorating changes of pace. The walls of one
gallery are covered with a single 109-image work from 1990 by the
German Conceptualist Hanne Darboven. The color photographs document
every page of a week-at-a-glance calendar completely filled with
the artist's abstract script, measuring time in wavelike ebbs and
flows.
</P>
<P>
   The next gallery presents two photographs by the German artist
Katharina Sieverding: enormous X-ray-like images that show the
human skull infused with clouds of liquid that suggest the
imagination depicted at a rolling boil. A tiny alcove in one corner
of this gallery holds one of the show's sweetest surprises, dopey
self-portraits of Eva and Adele, the angelic German performance
artists (a man and woman) known for a kind of double-cross
cross-dressing. They always appear at international art openings
dressed as identical female twins in bright vinyl suits and heavy
powder, but confuse matters with their shaved heads. The images are
accompanied by viewer mail.
</P>
<P>
   The show often progresses in telling juxtapositions of
sympathetic or contrasting sensibilities. In one of the early
galleries, a photograph generated by the latest installment of
Matthew Barney's ``Cremaster'' film series is a straight-on head
shot of the artist as Gary Gilmore, grim, gritty and carefully
staged.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way are 12 images from Andy Warhol's ``Social
Disease,'' his offhand oddly caricature snapshots from the 1970s of
the rich and famous and glamorous at play. They are, by the way,
the only images of celebrities in the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The German painters Sigmar Polke and Gerhard Richter, longtime
colleagues, take opposite walls, each represented by a small
gallery with a small series of photographs that share a gray
fuzziness and lackadaisical technique. Polke's double-exposed
images of starlike sculptures fashioned from a folding ruler are
from 1968 and brim with Post-Minimalist laissez-faire. Richter's
shadowy images, from 1991, show the artist and others in a murky
basement and exude some of the sinister, crime-scene ghostliness
reminiscent of early works like his Bader-Meinhoff paintings, which
were based on news photographs of the German terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   In another gallery, the straightforward photographs of William
Eggleston and Stephen Shore, all from the '70s, cast the American
South and the American West, respectively, in a glowing yet
desolate light in scenes riddled with social inequity, economic
decline and emotional isolation. Their genuineness is pointed up by
one large image from the intractably cerebral Rodney Graham, of a
tall and glorious ponderosa pine that is hung upside down.
Fittingly, the image recreates the inversion of the human retina
that makes all vision possible.

 &HT;    SHELTON: SPECULATION ON TROOPS TO EAST TIMOR PREMATURE
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's top military leader said Thursday that
the crisis in East Timor presents no threat to U.S. national
security interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speculation about any U.S. involvement is premature,'' Gen.
Henry H. Shelton said at a Senate hearing to confirm him to a
second term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton was responding to questions by Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who said he feared
the situation in East Timor could open up another operation for the
U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to overturn last week's referendum, in which almost
80 percent of East Timorese supported independence, rampaging armed
militias with ties to the Indonesian military have created what is
described as a humanitarian disaster. The Pentagon announced
Thursday it has suspended official relations with the Indonesian
military in light of Indonesia's failure to contain the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In written responses to committee questions, Shelton declined to
set a deadline for pulling U.S. military troops out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO's Kosovo force will be deployed as long as it is needed
to maintain a safe and secure environment for international efforts
to set the conditions for a lasting peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Warner and other senators praised Shelton and
indicated he would face no obstacles in his quest for another term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've served well as chairman,'' Warner said. ``I fully
anticipate giving you my strongest support.''
</P>
<P>
   Admiration came from both sides of the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been a wonderful, extraordinary leader,'' said Sen.
Carl Levin, D-Mich., ranking member of the committee. ``You have
successfully carried out peace-keeping operations in Bosnia, you've
conducted limited airstrikes in no-fly enforcement over Iraq,
you've carried out airstrikes and peace-keeping operations in and
around Kosovo ... I've seen up close your commitment to those
troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing the senators as a lone panelist in full military uniform,
the 6-foot-5-inch North Carolina native said his ``extremely busy''
first term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has gone by
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say time flies when you're having fun,'' he told the
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In the three-hour hearing, committee members also questioned
Shelton on topics including military retention and recruitment, the
effects of downsizing and the military threat from China and North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Edgecombe County, N.C., Shelton, 57, is the first
former commander of the18th Airborne Corps and of the Joint Special
Operations Command to hold the nation's top military post.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up on a 1,000-acre farm run by his father and uncle in
the small town of Speed and earned his commission through the ROTC
program at N.C. State University, where he graduated in 1963 with a
degree in textile engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He is a Green Beret, a paratrooper and former commander of the
82d Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton's first high-profile mission came in 1996 when he was
put in charge of the 20,000 American troops that were prepared to
restore Haiti's deposed President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to
power. The invasion became a peacekeeping mission, however, when
Haiti's military government agreed to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   The following year President Clinton selected him to serve as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   A full-Senate vote on Shelton's nomination is expected later
this month.

N. IRELAND POLICE URGED TO CUT ITS SIZE, END USE OF POLITICAL
EMBLEMS  
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland, _ The Northern Ireland police force
should drastically reduce its size, shed its politically charged
emblems and aggressively recruit Roman Catholic members to make the
agency better reflect the British province's population, a
long-awaited report recommended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that drew immediate Protestant anger, an international
panel headed by the former governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten,
also proposed abandoning the name Royal Ulster Constabulary that is
cherished by its officers and supporters but reviled by its many
Catholic detractors.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended creating a new civilian police control
board that would, significantly, include two members of Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. But the panel
turned aside the party's broader demand that the RUC, as it is
commonly called, be disbanded altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are transforming the RUC, not disbanding it,'' Patten said
at a news conference in which he pleaded for people to consider the
128-report and its 175 recommendations without springing to
judgments colored by the polarized politics of Ulster. ``Policing
in Northern Ireland has suffered, often with disastrous
consequences, from being a political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The force is 92 percent Protestant, and its many Catholic
critics have long accused it of being a harsh enforcer of
Protestant domination of their community, which makes up 43 percent
of the province's population. One of the most common slogans
scrawled on walls in Catholic neighborhoods is ``Disband the RUC.''
</P>
<P>
   Protestant politicians, on the other hand, praise its record at
fighting terrorism and celebrate its traditions of loyalty and
gallantry represented by the more than 300 of its officers who have
been killed in action and the thousands wounded and disabled.
Graffiti in Protestant neighborhoods in recent months have
expressed alarm at supposed plans to let ``terrorists'' run the
police.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Ulster Unionists, David Trimble, bluntly
signaled his displeasure with the report, calling it ``shoddy'' and
saying he was ``deeply offended'' at the notion of stripping the
service of its name and symbols. He called the recommendation ``a
gratuitous insult to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission recommended that the force be called the Northern
Ireland Police Service, that it get rid of its crown and harp crest
and that it fly a new police flag above stationhouses rather than
the Union Jack, which in Ulster is a symbol of Unionism, the
largely Protestant political movement that wants to keep the
province British.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aim is to take the politics out of policing, and we cannot
do that if the symbols of policing are themselves political
statements, or seen as such by a substantial section of the
community,'' Patten explained.
</P>
<P>
   Patten said he was aware of the significance of symbols to the
freighted history of Northern Ireland, and he acknowledged that
there was ``a lot of pain'' in the panel's conclusions for the
force.
</P>
<P>
   Though it operates in a country that is famous for unarmed law
enforcement, the constabulary is the most heavily armed police
force in Europe. With their mission often one of confronting
guerrilla operations or avoiding becoming the victims of such
actions, officers often walk their beats in bulletproof vests with
pistols and automatic rifles and operate out of hulking blocks of
brutalist architecture that bristle with barbed wire and security
cameras and that are protected against forced entry by drawbridge
entrances.
</P>
<P>
   The officers patrol the streets and lanes of Northern Ireland in
gray armor-plated vans with narrow bulletproof glass windows and
side gunports.
</P>
<P>
   Their strength has grown to 13,000 for an area that would
require 4,000 officers were it anywhere else in Britain, and the
Patten commission recommended that the right size in 10 years ought
to be 7,500. Patten added this condition: ``Provided the peace
process does not collapse and the security situation does not
deteriorate significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 19 members of the new Policing Board would be drawn
from the Northern Ireland Assembly, and that is the formula that
will permit the entry of two Sinn Fein delegates. The board will
set objectives and priorities, monitor performance and hold the
chief constable to public account.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to what he called ``scaremongering,'' Patten said no
person could join the force who had a history of participation in
paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   When the timing of the delivery of the report was originally set
for now, it had been widely expected that the new institutions of
the April 1998 peace settlement would be in place and functioning
and that the province's political life would be stable enough to
accommodate sweeping recommendations for change.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the putting into effect of the accord has become
deadlocked over the failure of the IRA and other paramilitary
groups to begin disarming, and the atmosphere now in Ulster is far
more unsettled than it was at the time of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Mowlam, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, said that some
of the policing changes could be done in months but that others
could take years. She said she hoped to present Parliament with the
necessary legislation by December.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, chairman of the original talks
that led to the peace settlement, has been in Belfast this week on
a scheduled rescue mission to break the stalemate. He left for the
United States on Wednesday to avoid becoming caught up in the
intense debate over the Patten report and will return on Monday.

 &HT;    Autobiography by aquatic Williams' as delightful as a `Mermaid'
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Esther Williams' book is a Joan Crawford
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Million Dollar Mermaid'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster) details a humble
birth, the tragic death of a teen-age brother, several worthless
husbands and wretched men, including a cross-dressing movie star
and an adolescent boy who raped her. Underlying it all is the
plucky, never-say-die Esther, whose sense of self led her to the
redemptive activity _ swimming _ that gave her an identity and a
Hollywood career.
</P>
<P>
   The book is a giddy blast, a guilty pleasure, and the
77-year-old Williams, after a quiet third act, is enjoying her
renaissance. ``Listen,'' she says via phone from Beverly Hills, ``I
got to see Hollywood at its best, and then I got to watch it go
into decline. I've had a very interesting time of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was, she writes, a survivor from conception. Mom tried to
get rid of her with mustard baths, vigorous bouts of horseback
riding, even jumping off a chest of drawers. The miscarriage didn't
happen; little Esther insisted on a prompt arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I better make my mother laugh,'' Williams writes.
``If you've been told that your mother tried to get rid of you when
she was pregnant, you really tend to be very nice as a child.
You've got to win popularity contests so that they won't say,
'Throw her back.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, she became a national swimming champion, and co-starred
in Billy Rose's Aquacade with Johnny Weissmuller, whose private
specialty was doffing his trunks so Williams could appreciate the
splendor of his endowment. The Aquacade led to MGM, where Louis B.
Mayer was looking for an equivalent of Sonja Henie, who was
finishing up a series of innocuous but highly lucrative skating
musicals at Fox.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, MGM knew she could be something special. She
did her screen test with Clark Gable, who was accompanied by the
ever-watchful Carole Lombard. Shortly thereafter, Lana Turner came
up to Williams at a party and snarled, ``This lot isn't big enough
for the both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, they both survived; indeed, flourished. Williams could
act enough to get by and boy, could she swim. The amazing thing
was, there was a market for her swimming. For the next 15 years,
she swam through a series of Technicolor musicals at MGM. They had
titles such as ``Fiesta'' and ``Bathing Beauty'' and ``On An Island
With You'' and ``Neptune's Daughter'' and ``Dangerous When Wet,''
with co-stars such as Ricardo Montalban and Fernando Lamas.
</P>
<P>
   Other stars got A-list leading men and directors, but, other
than the occasional help of Busby Berkeley on swimming numbers,
Williams had to carry her films on her rather broad shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Eye-opening Tinseltown tales
</P>
<P>
   And now Williams has done what nobody thought could be done
anymore _ raise eyebrows, mostly because of her candor about her
co-workers, from Weissmuller's groping exhibitionism to actor Jeff
Chandler's penchant for frilly chiffon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, I know a lot of movie stars, and it's very difficult to
find somebody who isn't playing their favorite role. June Allyson,
Gloria DeHaven, Ann Miller. I tell them, `Honey, the show's over.'
</P>
<P>
   ``As you grow older, you get more selective, and you realize
your life has been filled with people who were not, shall we say,
good casting. And you also realize you don't have to do it anymore.
These days, I'd rather read a good book than go to a party and
listen to dumb small talk. So why would I want to write a book of
dumb small talk?''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the juice about sex, Williams' book is remarkably
detailed and serious about the way MGM really worked _ and how the
only way to survive Louis B. Mayer was to stand up to him. ``You
can't yell at me until you can get to the end of the pool first,''
Williams once told Mayer. He paused, gulped, and allowed that she
might have a point.
</P>
<P>
   As with most narrowly focused movie stars, Williams kept making
the same movie over and over, and shouldn't have lasted as long as
she did, but there was something immensely likable about her. She
had a great smile and a sunny disposition, and she never pretended
to be something she wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, she would get an urge, only to have it
stifled, for the cardinal rule of MGM was if you found an actor
lucky enough to strike a responsive chord with the public, you kept
that actor working the same patch of ground until said patch began
to dry up and blow away. By that time, it was too late for the
actor, but that was their problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I told (MGM executive Benny Thau) that I'd like to do a
dry picture. `Cass Timberlane' was coming up with Spencer Tracy,
and I wanted to do that. But Benny said, 'Esther, we have to cast
Lana. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' And that was that.''
</P>
<P>
   In-depth views of actors
</P>
<P>
   Williams remembers life in the Dream Factory _ and no movies
were more dreamlike than Williams' _ as constant labor. ``I was on
21 magazine covers in one summer. Well, each photo had to have an
interview to go with it. There wasn't competition between the stars
so much as there was tunnel vision. The only people you really knew
were your makeup man and your wardrobe man, because you spent the
most time with them. You were always concentrating on the moment;
you had to get there on time and look right.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after it's over and the boat has sailed, and you're
retired, then you can get to know each other. I've become very good
friends with June Allyson, for instance. But some people you can't
get to know, and some are unhappy with their lives. I don't think
Debbie Reynolds is happy with the way things have turned out, but
nobody wants to hear you complain.''
</P>
<P>
   There are odd undercurrents in Williams' book. She obviously
didn't care much for Lana Turner, but she never really says why. It
turns out they had something in common: Fernando Lamas, who had a
fling with Turner _ everybody had a fling with Turner _ during the
1952 version of ``The Merry Widow,'' and who became Williams'
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew too much about Lana. Fernando had a way, in intimate
moments, of telling you about someone else he'd been intimate with.
I always thought it was kind of tricky, because I never told him a
thing. In an argument, he'd hit below the belt, and I knew if I
told him anything it would come back to haunt me. And I'd heard his
stories about Lana, because when they had an affair, she'd told him
about what Tyrone Power and some others were like.''
</P>
<P>
   All around her, women discarded husbands as if they were last
year's outmoded frocks, but Williams hung on to a couple of men
long after most people would have called for the check. There was
Ben Gage, a band singer who became an alcoholic and left her flat
broke and with an IRS debt of $750,000, just as her movie career
was breathing its last.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Lamas, a carnivorous egotist who wanted her
barefoot and pregnant, except he didn't like children, so he let it
go at barefoot and in the kitchen. They were married for 20 years,
until Lamas' death.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is philosophical about her bad taste in men. ``I had
children, three of them, and Ben was their father and he was like a
big kid with them. In my family you just stuck. You made
sacrifices. And there's something else; I made sure I was always
too busy to take that particular problem on and deal with the
psychological wrench.''
</P>
<P>
   More than we need to know
</P>
<P>
   There were a few affairs along the way, one with Victor Mature,
who was charming, and one with Jeff Chandler. Chandler and she were
talking about getting married _ the IRS debt finally motivated her
to divorce Gage _ when she walked in on him wearing women's
clothes. The relationship, which had been satisfyingly sexual for
nearly two years, came to a crashing halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make love to me, who are you making love to?'' asked
Williams. ``What roles are you playing in your mind?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a beautiful woman making love to a beautiful woman,''
replied Chandler. Trying to recoup his ground, Chandler blurted
out, ``You said I look like Betsy Bloomingdale and she looks
wonderful.'' Soon, Chandler was alone in the house, dressed in
chiffon, accompanied by the dying echoes of a slamming door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my therapist afterwards about why he showed me. 'They
always do if they're serious,' he said. 'He wanted to marry you and
he wasn't planning to quit.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't going to work; every time we'd have gone out, I
would have been wondering if he was envious of my dress. Liz Smith
gave me a scolding for writing about it, but it's been 40 years,
Jeff's been gone a long time, and after Monica and Bill nobody's
shocked by anything anymore. People say I victimized him, but him
doing that to me after nearly two years was like him not telling me
he had three kids. He should have told me the first day!''
</P>
<P>
   ``As for Fernando, I once asked my sister Maureen why I let
Fernando make me a captive. And she said, 'There's that word in
your business for when you take a scheduled break.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiatus? Honey, 20 years is quite a hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Well, you'd been working since you were 15. Maybe you just
needed a rest.'''
</P>
<P>
   As good an explanation as any. So Esther Williams went into the
swimming pool business and the swimsuit business and slowly paid
off the IRS. The years went by. She had signed a collateral
agreement, and the Feds will wait forever as long as you make the
payments. They finally forgave the last little bit, and she was
free and clear.
</P>
<P>
   Part of something special
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago she remarried, to a retired professor from
Villanova who's 10 years younger than she is. She's a remarkably
clear-eyed and funny woman and knows that she was part of something
special that will never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only bitterness I have is the same one that Mickey Rooney
and all the rest of us from that time have; that Ronnie Reagan
(then president of the Screen Actor's Guild) stood up and bargained
away residuals from our films. And what he offered in return was a
health and welfare plan, which means we can go to the Motion
Picture Home, which nobody who was a star wants to do. My wardrobe
woman is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the movie business will do to you if all you do is
the movie business. Watching Eleanor Powell dance until her feet
bled to do a guest shot in one of my movies was a very important
thing in my life. That's why I decided to go into business.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another key image in her life, and she remembers it
clearly. Williams was already a star, and on her way to being a
bigger star, when she sneaked onto a neighboring soundstage to
watch Ingrid Bergman do a scene for ``Gaslight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood in the shadows and watched someone who really knew
what she was doing. I was a novelty act and I knew it. Of course,
now they say that I'm 'unique,' so I must have been doing something
right.''

DISNEY TAKING TIME ON SPORTS FRANCHISES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS, this is a resend from wire file of Monday, Sept. 6.)  
 
  
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. -- What's taking so long?
</P>
<P>
   That's the basic message Wall Street has been sending The Walt
Disney Co. about unloading its struggling sports franchises, the
Anaheim Angels baseball team and the Mighty Ducks hockey team.
Rumors of a $400 million-plus deal with Orange County billionaire
Henry Nicholas emerged during the past week, yet the company's
shares haven't budged from the figurative pit they've been in for
nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing a backlash from Disney's shareholders over the
ownership of these franchises,'' said sports consultant David
Carter. ``(Disney Chairman) Michael Eisner can ill afford to be
perceived as throwing good money after bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which has declined comment, launched a review of assets
in late April amid growing investor concern about poor earnings
performance. Since then, it has instituted a hiring freeze; cut
jobs in film, TV and video operations; sold its Fairchild magazines
for $650 million; and pulled the plug on its three ESPN stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a smart move to sell the sports teams,'' said
Barry Hyman, a market strategist with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaumn.
``I never thought it was a good strategy to own them in the first
place. To me, they were always peripheral businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney paid a $50 million franchise fee for the Ducks in 1993,
signed a deal to buy the Angels in 1996 for $140 million and then
spent $90 million to renovate Anaheim Stadium. The attractiveness
of owning the teams began to dim last year when rival Fox beat
Disney in setting up a series of regional sports TV networks,
forcing Disney to ditch its plans for such a structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe, but Fox outmaneuvered Disney brilliantly
in getting the regional networks going,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe both the Angels and Ducks have been losing
money, so their sale has become almost a foregone conclusion in
recent months. As a result, recent rumors of a deal with Nicholas
have not budged Disney stock, which remains mired 34 percent below
its all-time high of $42.375 in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some time for the stock to recover,'' said
Linda Bannister, an analyst with Edward Jones. ``Disney has a ways
to go still. They are really taking a hard look at all their
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Cesinger, managing director with Greif &AMP; Co., noted that
the Angels have the ongoing problem of not being one of the primary
attractions for local consumers. ``If you look at sports in the Los
Angeles region, the Angels have always been just one of the many
elements that people have to choose from, so they have never been
that popular,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Cesinger agreed that Disney will have to do much more than
unload the sports teams to impress Wall Street. ``Eisner is going
after the low-hanging fruit first, so these first steps are sort of
the easy short-term Band-Aid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts offered a variety of further steps for Disney to boost
stock price, such as improved performance in overseas businesses,
releasing a hit film comparable to ``The Lion King'' and expanding
its Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   Disney stock closed up 18.75 cents at $27.9375 on Friday, when
the Angels fired manager Terry Collins after the team posted a
record of 51 wins and 82 losses -- the worst mark among the 30
major league teams.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said the dismal season may be accelerating Disney's
decision to pull the trigger on a deal. ``Right now, having the
Angels is a drag on Disney's image,'' he added. ``They don't have
to win the World Series every year, but they do need to be
competitive. Since TV revenues are not split among the teams,
losing makes the financial situation much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe that giving up on the Angels and Ducks also
signals that Disney plans to focus more of its resources on its
theme parks division, its top profit generator in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Burbank-based conglomerate will open its $1.4 billion
California Adventure attraction adjacent to Disneyland in 2001, but
it has clearly dropped the ambitious plan to develop a
sports-entertainment complex in the area between Edison Field and
the Arrowhead Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major league baseball and hockey are clearly not Disney's core
competencies,'' said Kevin Skislock, an entertainment analyst with
Laguna Research Partners. ``I think they're taking a much more
realistic view of their future in Anaheim. They have to focus on
businesses where they get a superior return.''

DOZENS KILLED IN APARTMENT BLAST; AUTHORITIES BLAME TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ At least 32 people died in a deafening explosion that
leveled much of a nine-story apartment building here minutes after
midnight Thursday morning, and the mayor said there was a ``high
degree of confidence'' that terrorists staged the blast.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow police clamped new security measures on the city,
which was already jittery after an explosion last week at an
upscale shopping mall, for which terrorists have been blamed.
</P>
<P>
   But city and federal investigators, while leaning toward the
conclusion that a bomb was the cause of Thursday's explosion,
declined to say outright that it was a terrorist act. And other
shreds of evidence, including rumors that paint or other products
were being produced in the building, left open the possibility that
the explosion was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   At least 153 people were injured in the blast, which occurred at
12:02 a.m. in a factory neighborhood in southeast Moscow, in a
crook of the Moscow River. Another 1,200 were evacuated from the
sprawling apartment block, a faceless gray concrete building like
thousands of others thrown up during the long rule of the Soviet
leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers estimate that as many as 50 victims might lie
under the rubble, and workers were still clearing debris by hand
Thursday night to avoid injuring anyone who might have survived the
explosion. But they held out little hope that any were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no miracle, much as we want one,'' the chief of
the rescue service of the Emergency Situations Ministry, Maj. Gen.
Stanislav Suanov, said Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   After a tour of the site, Mayor Yuri Luzhkov suggested that the
explosion was staged in response to Russian military action in
Dagestan, where Islamic rebels backed by Chechens are attempting to
set up their own state.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Luzhkov said that the blast was apparently
caused by a military explosive, Hexogen, which is used in munitions
and which had a force between 650 and 900 pounds of TNT.
</P>
<P>
   But federal and city investigators were less categorical. They
called the explosion the product of ``industrially produced''
explosives, perhaps including those used in fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the location of the explosion, in an anonymous apartment
building far removed from government facilities, seem to hold any
special attraction for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov said, ``Visual signs suggest that it was a terrorist act
similar to the one carried out in Buinaksk.'' He was referring to a
terrorist bombing of Russian military housing in Dagestan last
weekend that killed 64 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot rule out that this is a string of terrorist acts,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Russian fighters bombed their villages in Dagestan last
week, members of the Wahabites, a strict Islamic sect, retaliated
by bombing the apartment building in Buinaksk.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous caller told the Interfax news service that the
explosion was ``our response to air strikes against peaceful
villages in Chechnya and Dagestan.'' But the legitimacy of that
call was questionable.
</P>
<P>
   The Buinaksk bombing caused a furor in Moscow, where military
commanders were widely accused of incompetence for their attack on
the villages. But it also stiffened the resolve of Russian leaders,
who have intensified attacks on Islamic strongholds in Dagestan in
an effort to stamp out the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   While the latest explosion was huge by any measure, such
incidents are not unknown here. A number of Moscow buildings have
been rocked by accidental natural-gas explosions in recent years,
and bombings by criminal gangs are not unheard of. Earlier this
year a bomb apparently planted by criminals tore out a wall in an
upper floor of a downtown Moscow hotel.
</P>
<P>
   With all the doubts about the cause of the blast, the Moscow
authorities are taking no chances. Loudspeaker announcements in the
city's vast subway system urged riders to be on the lookout for
suspicious parcels. The omnipresent traffic police and militia
spent the day stopping cars and trucks with out-of-region license
plates, looking for evidence of terrorist activity.
</P>
<P>
   Security has been tight in Moscow in recent days as the city
celebrated a birthday _ an annual high-profile event _ and
weathered the bombing of the mall, which seriously injured several
people. No one has been arrested in connection with that bombing,
which initially was blamed on Islamic terrorists but may have been
tied to an obscure antitechnology movement.

NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA SENATORS WIN VICTORY FOR TRANSIT DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The four Democratic senators from New York and
California on Thursday defeated a Republican attempt to cut
millions of dollars in federal mass-transit funds targeted for the
two states and divvy it up among the other 48.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., withdrew his effort to divert an
estimated $278 million in federal transit aid to New York and
California for subways, light rail and bus systems after he failed
to defeat a threatened Democratic filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby, who chairs the Senate appropriations transportation
subcommittee, had argued that the money should instead be doled out
in $5.5 million chunks to the other 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped his proposal after Senate Republicans failed to get
the 60 votes needed to cut off debate on it. All 45 Senate
Democrats plus four Republicans _ Sens. John H. Chafee of Rhode
Island, George V. Voinovich of Ohio, Michael D. Crapo of Idaho and
John W. Warner of Virginia _ voted against Shelby, who lost on a
49-to-49 vote.
</P>
<P>
   After the defeat, Shelby's press secretary Andrea Andrews said
the senator would drop the New York-California provision from the
Senate bill appropriating transportation funds for the new fiscal
year starting Oct. 1 ``because he wants the bill to pass and it
can't pass with this provision.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said he had inserted the provision in the bill because
``I believe transit should be a more national program.''
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told reporters
she was ``grateful'' to her colleagues for blocking the provision,
which she described as ``predominantly political'' and ``a hit at
four Democratic senators.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the vote shows that other states recognize that funds
for mass transit are crucial for California and New York ``because
we have 50 percent of the transit riders in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelby denied that his reason for slipping the provision in was
political.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that the (Democrats) mischaracterized the equity
provision as a partisan issue _ it is not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby's provision would have slashed California's mass-transit
funds by 13 percent or $118 million and New York's by 33 percent or
$160 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who had described Shelby's
provision as ``highway robbery against California,'' said,
``Fairness triumphed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., characterized Shelby's proposal
``as a dagger pointed'' at New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only a great victory for Long Island and New York but
for mass transit in general and for fairness in our process,''
Schumer said. ``The Senate decided it wasn't fair to hurt two
states dramatically and help the others just a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference after the vote in front of a map
of New York's subway system, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
hailed the vote as a vote to uphold a master plan for federal
transit aid that Congress approved last year.
</P>
<P>
   Formulas for doling out federal mass-transit money for the
states were part of the six-year Transportation Equity Act enacted
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big decision by the Congress, and suddenly we find
that in a subcommittee of the appropriations committee, the bill is
being rewritten,'' Moynihan said. ``You can't have an orderly
legislative process if you vote to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Shelby's measure, the San Francisco Bay Area stood to lose
nearly $30 million, San Diego nearly $10 million and Los Angeles
nearly $48 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany-Schenectady-Troy area would have lost $2 million
while New York City and Northeastern New Jersey combined would have
lost $143 million.

RESCUE CONTINUES IN GREECE; DEATH TOLL HITS 83 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ As much of Greece watched live television
coverage of rescue efforts on Thursday, the government announced
that the toll from Tuesday's earthquake had reached 83 dead.
</P>
<P>
   There are 45 people still missing, and officials said 1,600
people had been injured in the Athens quake, which had an intensity
of 5.9. Three hundred of the injured were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of finding more survivors faded during the day, but a
palpable surge of emotion lifted spirits when French rescue workers
pulled a woman from the wreckage of what had been a detergent
factory.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Evi Vassilopoulos, had been buried for 46 hours.
After rescuers located her under the rubble, her husband spoke to
her through an audio device, reassuring her that help was on the
way as the nation looked on by television.
</P>
<P>
   An official who is helping to direct rescue efforts, Panayotis
Fourlas, a deputy chief of the Athens fire department, said there
were no other signs of life beneath any of the collapsed buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we should not be put off,'' Fourlas said, ``because there
was no sign of life when we discovered the first six and then three
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the deaths were reported at the detergent factory and at
an electrical appliance showroom nearby. Both buildings collapsed
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools were closed for the second day, as was the Athens
Stock Exchange. Most of the city's historic sites remained open,
among them the Parthenon, where a few loose stones fell but no
serious damage was recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The National Archeological Museum, where an undetermined number
of clay vessels and other artifacts were broken, was ordered closed
at least through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Costas Simitis said prosecutors would bring
charges against any architects, contractors or public officials
found to have tolerated violations of building codes or
construction standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our desire is for them to be found and punished as soon as
possible,'' Simitis said. He said the government was completing the
construction of tent cities that would house many of the 70,000
people left homeless by the quake, and promised financial help to
homeowners and business owners who had suffered losses.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the Justice Ministry arrived before dawn at
the sites of collapsed buildings, and spent much of the day
collecting samples of concrete and other material that could be
used as evidence at future proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   As they worked, inspectors from the Environment Ministry
continued a survey of buildings that had been damaged in the quake.
They have declared more than 800 to be unsafe, and ordered them all
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry, in a preliminary estimate, said the quake
had caused about $325 million worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
   Greek and French rescuers were joined by teams from Switzerland,
Germany, Ukraine, the Czech Republic and Turkey. Together they have
pulled more than 100 survivors from underneath piles of debris.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish rescuers, who were warmly welcomed, said they were
especially pleased to be here because they wanted to repay the
generous aid that Greece sent to Turkey after last month's
devastating quake there.
</P>
<P>
   Nasuh Mahruh, head of the Turkish team, which is made up of
volunteers and not connected to the Turkish government, said, ``If
we can help in these rescue efforts, we will be very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the two quakes came within less than a month of
each other raised fears that tectonic movements beneath the soil of
Greece and Turkey might continue. Those fears increased in the
pre-dawn hours Thursday, when two tremors registering intensities
of 4.8 and 5.2 shook the Greek island of Samothrace and the nearby
Turkish island of Gokceada. The islands lie near the entrance to
the Dardanelles, the straight in northwestern Turkey that connects
the Mediterranean to the Sea of Marmara.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone service to Samothace was disrupted, and shaking was
felt as far away as Istanbul, but no injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the Kandilli Observatory in Istanbul said
the Athens quake was ``isolated'' and not related to the one on
Aug. 17 that was centered near the Turkish town of Izmit. That
quake was far stronger, killing more than 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   One expert on the seismology of this region, Ahmet Cakmak, a
professor of engineering at Princeton University, agreed with that
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no relation between the two earthquakes,''
Cakmak said. ``An earthquake in Izmit should have no impact on
Greece. There will almost certainly be other very serious quakes in
that part of the world, but in all probability they won't strike
anytime soon. The likely time frame is well into the next
century.''

PACIFIC STOCK EXCHANGE MOVES TOWARD FOR-PROFIT STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: Corrects byline)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Pacific Stock Exchange is asking members to
approve a proposal to transform its equities business into a
for-profit corporate unit, which managers believe will run far more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between running a corporation and running
a political party,'' Dale Carlson, the exchange's vice president
for corporate affairs, said Wednesday when the proposal was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Members have until Oct. 4 to cast their proxy votes on the
proposal. If approved, it would be forwarded to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and, with its approval, possibly implemented
before the end of the year, said Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   That would make the Pacific Stock Exchange the first U.S.
</P>
<P>
   securities market to move formally toward a for-profit corporate
structure.
</P>
<P>
   The PCX board of governors has approved the proposal, which
would ``demutualize'' the exchange's equities business and
reorganize it as a wholly owned corporate subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   This would be known as PCX Equities Inc., which PCX Chairman and
CEO Philip D. DeFeo said ``will be more nimble, more agile and more
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We are positioning our equities business to be able
to raise capital in the public market, which it cannot do now. It
will be cheaper and more accessible for retail and institutional
firms. And, it will be more attractive to potential strategic
alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   The equities business is one-third of the San Francisco-based
exchange's activity, with options representing two-thirds. That
business is unaffected by the proposal, said Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   PCX Equities Inc. would have a board of directors that would
function like any other corporate board, overseeing management of
the exchange, setting policies and governing the operations, said
Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   New agility would come from its corporate nature, and the
equities business is currently hampered by the membership
cooperative surrounding it, said Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now every time we want to change a rule, a practice, a
listing, an allocation, the dress code, it has to go through a set
of member committees,'' said Carlson. ``By putting that
decision-making responsibility in the hands of a management team,
we feel we will be able to move more quickly, implement changes
more quickly, respond more quickly to opportunities and challenges
that come up in the marketplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traders spend about $8,000 a month to lease seats on the
exchange from members and one must own or lease a seat to trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific, a not-for-profit membership organization, wants to
introduce permits that traders would lease directly from the
exchange for about $2,000 a month. Traders on the competing Boston
Stock Exchange, for example, don't have to pay anything to lease
seats to trade there.
</P>
<P>
   One seat owner was skeptical Thursday. ``I'm in favor of
spinning off the floor, but I'm not in favor of the equity trading
permits,'' said Paul Liang, who owns 49 of the exchange's 552 seats
and leases them to traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will result in the dilution of our seats. I have to wait
and read every detail before I decide one way or another,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If conversion to for-profit status is successful, the exchange
may consider raising money through a public offering or a private
placement, said Carlson. Both the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq stock market are considering public offerings.

 &HT;    DANFORTH HAS TOOLS, SUPPORT FOR AN EFFECTIVE PROBE, EXPERTS SAY
 &HT;    With WACO.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After five investigations have tried and failed,
former U.S. senator Jack Danforth appears to have the right tools
to dig out the truth about what happened six years ago near Waco,
Texas, an array of experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A former Republican lawmaker and Episcopal priest, Danforth _
nicknamed ``St. Jack'' for his integrity and stubborn independence
_ arrives to lead the new investigation with strong backing from
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Both the support and the probe's ground rules are seen as key as
Danforth pursues what he called the ``dark questions'' of whether
the FBI or other federal officials killed civilians or covered up
the truth about the April 19, 1993, assault on the Branch Davidian
compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident we will get the answers to those questions,''
said Joseph diGenova, who has served as a federal prosecutor and an
independent counsel. ``Senator Danforth has sufficient gravitas
that he will be able to apply the appropriate pressure if he's not
getting what he needs.''
</P>
<P>
   With this year's demise of the independent counsel law, Danforth
will be the first investigator to operate under the new ``special
counsel'' regulations that require him to be supervised by a deputy
to Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   That means that Danforth would have to seek approval for issuing
subpoenas and seating a grand jury. But the former Missouri
senator, standing beside Reno at a news conference, said he had
resolved the issue of his independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all questions that I have asked over the last few
days, `` he said. ``And I am satisfied that I will be able to call
them as I see them, and I am satisfied that that is my mandate. And
that is the basis under which I took this job, and that is what I'm
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Bromwich, the former inspector general for the
Justice Department, said the arrangement appeared to be workable.
``It appears that he has the investigative tools that he needs to
get the information that he needs,'' said Bromwich, who has led a
handful of probes of the FBI and other Justice Department
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Bromwich has argued that the FBI is not capable of investigating
itself, a view that Danforth also expressed. Danforth said Thursday
he would go elsewhere in the government and in the private sector
for his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth answered another widely held concern by picking an
experienced prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Edward L. Dowd, to be his
deputy. Dowd was appointed by President Clinton for his eastern
Missouri post six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, former Treasury undersecretary Ronald K. Noble, a
veteran of past Waco probes, warned that the new Waco investigator
must ``have significant prosecutorial experience.'' In a New York
Times commentary Sunday, Noble urged Reno not to pick ``a former
senator or statesman, who has a fine reputation for honesty, but
who will have to learn on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the inclusion of Dowd could remedy that problem as well
as give a bipartisan tone to the probe, the experts warned that
Danforth faces formidable challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and his team have an enormous factual record to master,''
said Bromwich, who noted that besides the Treasury report, the
Justice Department had twice examined the Waco assault, in addition
to probes in both houses of Congress and private investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not starting from scratch,'' Bromwich said. ``It's much
harder for somebody who's got to do it, or redo it a second or
third time.''
</P>
<P>
   David T. Hardy, a private attorney from Tucson, Ariz., who has
spent much of the last four years pressing and suing the government
for documents on Waco, reflected on the many stone walls he has hit
in trying to get at the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to dig and keep on digging and accept the
fact that a good part of what he hears may be lies,'' Hardy said.
``Unless they see that there's some danger growing out of the lie
which is greater than telling it, they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Hardy expressed optimism about the latest probe and the
special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Danforth) has the powers and energy, he'll be able the do
the job. He might at least resolve what happened on the day of the
fire.''

   That view was echoed by Sheila Martin, a member of the Davidians
whose husband and four oldest children died in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get someone new looking at it, there's always the
hope he'll have a different attitude,'' she said. ``Janet Reno
chose him, and it seems like there was quite a bit of pressure on
her to find someone honest and who would make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who now lives in Waco with her two surviving children,
said she was ambivalent about reliving the details of the tragedy.
``I know they died horrible deaths, and I don't want to get any
more depressed. But there's also a part of you that wants the truth
to come out. While I don't want to hear anymore gruesome details, I
also don't want them doing this to anyone else.''

BAD SUMMER LEAVES SAINTS' RICKY WILLIAMS DISGRUNTLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are the dreadlocks, the pierced ear, tongue and lip. Yet
that's not the part of the head of Saints running back Ricky
Williams that has raised a few eyebrows lately. He may be a sure
bet on the field. But off of it, he has been unpredictable _ at
least to outsiders who've tried to make sense of what makes him
tick.
</P>
<P>
   On May 14, Williams, college football's all-time leading career
rusher and the 1999 Heisman Trophy winner, signed a heavily
incentive-based contract. The deal would pay him less than $1
million annually for each season from 2000 to 2005 that he rushes
for fewer than 1,600 yards. Since the NFL went to a 16-game
schedule in 1978, Earl Campbell in 1978 and George Rogers in 1981
are the only rookies to have cleared 1,600 yards rushing in a
season.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, Williams, either distraught with his new coaching
staff or his new teammates, wondered aloud to local reporters: ``I
guess I thought certain things when I got here and now that I'm
here, it's kind of different _ just the way things work here. Teams
that win are the guys that go out and play and not just for money,
but because they love the game and love their teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, Saints coach Mike Ditka said that an ankle injury
Williams suffered Aug. 14 would not keep him out of the season
opener this Sunday against Carolina. Williams refuted what Ditka
said, telling ESPN that he'd be out five weeks, until the club's
third game of the season Oct. 3 in Chicago. A day later, Williams
said doctors never told him he'd miss so much time.
</P>
<P>
   Williams this week said he's going to start the opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's soft-spoken, shy _ a really hard guy to get to know,''
Saints quarterback Billy Joe Hobert said of Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Williams was shown posing in a wedding dress, next to
Ditka in a tuxedo, on the cover of ESPN The Magazine. New Orleans
general manager Bill Kuharich said most Saints fans looked at the
photo as good fun. There were, however, some fans who were
offended, namely a women's group that told Kuharich that Williams
and Ditka ``disgraced the idea of marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, \RESPN\S wanted to do the American Gothic picture
\Rof a farmer and his wife\S, but that didn't work out,'' Williams
said. ``And then, at the last minute, they said they spent all that
money and got the photographer down there and I didn't want to rain
on their parade. So I went along with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think the reaction would be the way it has been. It
was all in fun. My mom was kind of upset about it. She said I
should have told her about it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the recent run of events, one must wonder if the
Ditka-Williams marriage is already in need of some counseling. ``I
think that he's the coach, and I'm one of the players, and it
pretty much stops right there,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams remains popular in New Orleans. Not since Earl Campbell
ended his career in 1985 has the city had such a star to call their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is doing his best to appease those who want a piece of
him. ``He's been tremendously receptive to anything we've asked him
to do, appearances, interviews, commercials, autograph signings,''
Kuharich said.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity status, however, has taken its toll. In training
camp, he cut back his post-workout interview sessions with the
media from every other day to once a week. And when he did talk, it
was with his helmet on. He also stopped going to the mess hall for
meals, instead sending roommate P.J. Franklin _ a free-agent wide
receiver who doubles as Williams' card-playing partner _ to fetch
his meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it when every time I leave I have to be
confronted,'' Williams said. ``If everyone was nice and they were
all cute kids, that'd be cool. If people would be more considerate,
I'd understand more. Some people just throw things in your face,
give you a pen \Rto sign an autograph\S and don't even say thank
you. It makes you feel like you are not a person. That's tough to
deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams will have even tougher things to deal with on Sundays
this season. Though the Saints have talented offensive linemen in
Willie Roaf and Kyle Turley, Williams must perform as part of a
unit that averaged 82.8 yards rushing per game in 1998, last in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing this, Williams still signed the contract that has had
many league insiders chuckling. He received an $8.8 million signing
bonus. But if he fails to gain 1,600 yards over the next seven
seasons, his base salary would range from $250,000 to $400,000.
Considering the Indianapolis Colts gave rookie Edgerrin James a
seven-year, $49 million contract that included a $9.5 million
signing bonus, Williams could become the cheapest franchise player
in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Williams refuses to second-guess himself, or his
agent, Leland Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed the contract. It was my name, and I stand under my
contract, and if I don't make the money that's my fault,'' he said.
``I felt I should have been the No. 1 guy picked in the draft. In
order to make that kind of money, I have to rush for those many
yards.''

Considering the Indianapolis Colts gave rookie Edgerrin James a
seven-year, $49 million contract that included a $9.5 million
signing bonus, Williams could become the cheapest franchise player
in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Williams refuses to second-guess himself, or his
agent, Leland Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed the contract. It was my name, and I stand under my
contract, and if I don't make the money that's my fault,'' he said.
``I felt I should have been the No. 1 guy picked in the draft. In
order to make that kind of money, I have to rush for those many
yards.''

WILLIAMS, HINGIS: THE RIVALRY IS INTENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Venus Williams, a scowler and growler on the court,
beat Barbara Schett the other night to earn a spot in the US Open
semifinals, and she was in a teasing mood afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The subject, as is often the case when a member of the Williams
family speaks, was Martina Hingis, Venus's opponent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to go. I'm sure she's ready to go,'' Williams said.
``Who knows, she's probably on the practice court right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams laughed, and the press conference gathering laughed
with her.
</P>
<P>
   It's some 15 hours later, midday on Wednesday, and maybe this
means something and maybe it doesn't. Hingis took a practice court
at the USTA National Tennis Center and went to work with regular
hitting partner Magdalena Grzybowska of Poland, who happens to be
about the same height as Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis worked on moving Grzybowska around the court. They
pounded shots at each other from the baseline. Hingis had
Grzybowska move her around the court. Hingis hit backhand after
backhand. The workout was scheduled to last an hour. The hour came
and went. And 40 minutes later, Hingis called it quits on a sour
note.
</P>
<P>
   She was working the baseline and hit a forehand just long. She
screamed, then skimmed her racket along the court like a flat rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are her groundstrokes,'' said one observer. ``They're so
finely tuned, she assumes they'll all be in.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit of a perfectionist?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way you get there,'' said the Hingis fan.
</P>
<P>
   There is the top of the list of the best women tennis players in
the world. There is a five-time grand slam champion, including the
1997 US Open.
</P>
<P>
   There is the prime target for the rest of women's tennis and, in
particular, Venus and Serena and Richard and heck, who knows, maybe
even Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The War of Words, the Tempest in a Tennis Tournament, has come
down to this: world No. 1 Hingis and No. 1 wanna _ and maybe gonna
_ be Venus will duke it out Friday afternoon for a chance to play
again in the final. In the other semifinal, defending champion
Lindsay Davenport has her own Williams to contend with, Serena.
</P>
<P>
   This is life at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, who turns 19 in three weeks, is here.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else is not. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   A field of 127 women started chasing Hingis nearly two weeks
ago, each loving to get to No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Few will. Venus, 19, and Serena, 18 at the end of the month,
could very well.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams has been saying so for years. And he got things
going here when he mused about another All-Williams final to match
the one at the Lipton Championships last March.
</P>
<P>
   A proud _ and loud _ papa.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, who manages to get herself in enough trouble by speaking
her mind, took the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always have a big mouth,'' Hingis said. ``They always
talk a lot. It happened before. It's going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena to Martina: ``That's just her problem. She's always been
the type of person that she says things, just speaks her mind. I
guess it has a little bit to do with not having a formal education.
But you somehow just have to think more, you have to use your brain
a little more in the tennis world.''
</P>
<P>
   Martina's revenge: ``I don't think I'm all that dumb. I'd like
to see some other people talking in three languages. It's not
always easy.''
</P>
<P>
   That was all in the first week of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis said she and Serena laughed and joked and talked about
the whole thing in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people, they always blow it up,'' Hingis said.``They just
try to make something big out of nothing, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first week, Hingis and Richard Williams _ at least
publicly _ made up. Hingis said Williams had always asked for her
autograph, so she brought him into her press conference and
presented one to him.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she would like nothing better than to hand one of his
daughters a loss. And, if necessary, do the same tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   First things first.
</P>
<P>
   Venus is rising. She had not gotten out of the second round of
the two majors in which she had played before roaring into the
finals here in 1997, where she lost to Hingis, 6-0, 6-4. Even then,
she was remembered as much for a bumping incident in the semifinals
with Irina Spirlea. Now Venus is No. 3 in the world, has won five
titles this year, but surprisingly has not made a major final
since.
</P>
<P>
   The cover of one tennis magazine, with Venus pictured, coming
into this event: ``Put up or shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis puts up. And this week, the two camps have pretty much
shut up when it comes to the verbal volleys.
</P>
<P>
   The Sisters Williams are saying nice things about how Hingis
thinks on the court. Nice things about her as a competitor. They
acknowledge that she is No. 1. For now, at least.
</P>
<P>
   This from Serena on the Venus-Hingis match: ``Martina thinks
very well on the court. She's hitting balls harder. She's moving
the ball around. She's really moving up. She's doing a lot of good
things. So Venus is going to have to attack, not make too many
errors. I think she can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hingis, who made tabloid headlines for calling New York
``snobby,'' on Venus: ``She's probably more consistent, more
steady, especially on the hard court. I think she's improved a lot.
She thinks more about what she's got to do. She's pretty much
become an all-around player. She comes in, she has a good serve,
good returns, good movement for her height. Very solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis gave her buddy, Schett, some tips on how to play Venus.
Work the forehand. Flat balls to the forehand. Mix it up.
</P>
<P>
   There were other Hingis hints. ``Maybe her serve gets a little
bit shaky at some points,'' Hingis said. ``Like at critical
moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Schett did not have the game to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, of course, does. Venus, she points out, has not won a
major title, and the pressure is on her.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, for her part, figures that if she is on her game and
doesn't give points away, there is no doubt how things will turn
out, no matter how Hingis plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm playing my best, it's tough guys,'' Williams said with
a smile. ``C'mon.''
</P>
<P>
   So bring it on.
</P>
<P>
   Venus, with that scowl and with beads in her hair and her power
and bright form-fitting outfits, chasing down everything and
showing off her ups for the occasional overhead.
</P>
<P>
   And Hingis, killing you softly with her smile, with her hair
pulled back tight, trying this and trying that and changing things
up if needed with the experience of five major titles behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis and Williams, any Williams, is a rivalry years _ heck,
decades _ in the making, and one that with any luck will carry well
into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The story goes that Richard Williams, never a tennis lover,
decided to have two more daughters and raise them to be tennis
stars, and then went and did it.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time in Czechoslovakia, Melanie Monitor was
naming her only daughter Martina. For Martina Navratilova. Two
years later, Martina the younger was on the tennis court and on her
way to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Martina and Venus. This afternoon.

WILL ONLINE GROCERY SHOPPING BE THE NEXT BIG TREND IN E-COMMERCE?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumers these days think nothing of buying books or Barbies
online. But will they also e-shop for eggs?
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of online grocers think so, and are racing to
build the warehouses and Web sites to capitalize on what they see
as the next big trend in dot.com commerce. But there are a chorus
of doubters in the next aisle.
</P>
<P>
   The Webvan Group, based in the San Francisco area, is the latest
to place a big bet that time-starved consumers will soon abandon
shopping carts and checkout lanes for the convenience of having
diapers, juice and lettuce delivered. The company, which has been
filling orders only since May, is spending $1 billion to build
automated warehouses in 26 markets and is planning a public
offering of stock in October to raise as much as $345 million to
finance even more growth.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod, Streamline.com Inc. and Shoplink Inc., among others, are
also investing in systems and additional operations to take on the
$450 billion brick-and-mortar supermarket industry.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, the companies say, consumers in virtually
any metropolitan area will be able to buy food staples and
household products via computer with the same quality and prices
offered at Safeway or Kroger. Although analysts are skeptical, most
predict that they will be profitable within two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue about whether this is a speculative business
is waning,'' said John Icke, chairman and chief executive of
Shoplink in Boston, which says it makes more than 2,300 deliveries
a week, with an average order of $102. ``I think we are just an
indicator that if you get set up correctly to do this business,
people will shop this way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shoplink and others face an uphill battle. The challenge
will be to attract and retain enough repeat customers in a
volume-driven business with razor-thin profit margins. It will take
more than the ease of pointing and clicking to get consumers in the
habit of ordering bread and milk online.
</P>
<P>
   The companies must overcome die-hard shopping habits,
often-limited product selections and a preference among some people
simply to squeeze their own melons. In addition, price is likely to
be a factor for many budget-conscious consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Online grocers say their real edge is offering consumers an easy
way to scratch off one more tedious item from their weekly ``to
do'' lists. Essentially, they say, they are selling convenience as
much as canned goods. And, they add, they will become even more
competitive with traditional grocers as they work the kinks out and
market more aggressively to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Because online grocers often lack the buying clout of Kroger,
Safeway and other large chains, they cannot always match their
prices or offer the same discount deals. Tack on delivery fees of
as much as $30 a month or Federal Express shipping costs, and the
final price for $100 worth of goods can be enough to keep many
people from hitting the ``send'' key.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod (www.peapod.com), for instance, charges a variety of
rates, from $5 for a single delivery in San Francisco to $19.95 for
an unlimited number of $60-plus monthly deliveries in Chicago.
Shoplink (www.shoplink.com) charges a monthly fee of $25 for a
once-a-week delivery. Extra orders are $15.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping by computer works like this: After logging into the Web
site, customers can browse the ``aisles,'' identified by categories
like general grocery, baby, health and beauty and snacks. But
filling a shopping cart comes with hassles that can try the
patience of even the most loyal e-customer.
</P>
<P>
   Want cereal? It is not as simple as grabbing it off a shelf. At
Peapod, for instance, shoppers must click on ``cereal and
breakfast,'' but that does not immediately show, say, Grape Nuts.
The menu then asks if shoppers want bagels, pancakes or all cereals
and oatmeal. It goes on. From there, the shopper must decide
between various options, like cold family cereal or children's
cereal. Only then can they find the Grape Nuts or Cheerios.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone needing about 50 items, making out a shopping list
can take as long as driving to the supermarket and going through
the aisles. The companies note, though, that after the first
purchase, customers can order from their original lists and revise
them with relative ease.
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback is that the services are useless to poor or
low-income consumers who lack credit cards and computers. And many
consumers will need to be persuaded that an order of produce will
not mean getting stuck with bruised peaches and too-green bananas.
Further, while some sites will deliver goods to locked boxes, which
include freezers, in a customer's garage, others require the buyer
to be home to receive the delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as prices, distribution and consumer awareness improve,
the online grocers bet that they can increasingly encroach on
competitors who must factor store displays, checkout clerks and
real estate for parking lots into their pricing structures. So far,
though, the traditional supermarket chains, while watching the
action carefully, have little to fear from their online rivals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Virtual supermarkets sold a measly $148 million worth of
groceries, health and beauty aids and other household items last
year, according to Jupiter Communications, which tracks electronic
retailing. By 2002, Jupiter says, the figure is expected to soar to
$3.5 billion, but even that would still represent less than 1
percent of overall supermarket sales. And few online operators have
made money so far, though they make the typical Internet argument
that building market share takes priority.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger Co., for one, is not panicking. ``Based on the numbers
we've seen,'' said Gary Rhodes, a spokesman for the company, ``we
think it's still very, very small.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kroger is still experimenting with various virtual models
for its business. ``I think it boils down to cost and proving that
you can deliver the right order to the right customer at the right
time,'' Rhodes said. ``There probably aren't too many retailers
that can do all of that consistently and profitably at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agree, saying that the online end of the industry is
essentially in a period of costly trial and error and that
consumers may ultimately decide it is a silly idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, all of e-commerce is a loss-leader business,'' said
Ken Cassar, an analyst with Jupiter's digital commerce group. ``The
game today is acquire customers and lose as little money as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The risks have not stopped companies from rapidly expanding in
hopes of persuading shoppers to defect from the neighborhood
grocer. Streamline's revenues more than doubled in the latest
quarter, to $3.63 million, but it lost $4 million, compared with
$2.6 million a year earlier, in large part because of investment
spending. Now the company, which raised $42 million in a public
stock offering in June, is accelerating its national growth even
more.
</P>
<P>
   Streamline's initial strategy was to operate in 7 to 10 markets
by the end of 2001 and 13 markets by 2004, but the company has
revised the plan to capture the momentum of greater-than-expected
consumer demand and changing market conditions. The company, based
in Westwood, Mass., now expects to be in 20 markets by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod, too, is ramping up. ``Because of the competition in the
category we do intend to speed up our plans and start growing
again,'' said Andrew Parkinson, chief executive of Peapod, which is
based in Skokie, Ill., and operates in eight markets, including
Chicago, San Francisco and New York's Long Island. ``What that
means is you'll see us go into multiple cities in 2000 and going
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the other companies, though, Peapod has yet to turn a
profit and is still working out the bugs. In its latest quarter, it
had flat revenues of $17.5 million and a net loss of $4.9 million,
compared with a loss of $4.5 million in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company now promises only next-day service, scrapping its
effort to deliver groceries to customers within three hours. It has
also switched to central distribution centers, no longer having
drivers fill orders from existing supermarkets. And Peapod is
continuing to tweak its product mix.
</P>
<P>
   Netgrocer, too, has struggled to perfect its methods and cost
structure. In just four years in business, it has dismissed half
its 70 workers, replaced its management team and scrapped a planned
public stock offering. The company, which delivers nonperishable
items _ from graham cracker pie crusts to pet flea collars _ via
Federal Express, had 1998 revenues of about $3 million, but lost
$17 million.
</P>
<P>
   But with more than $4 million in new, private financing, a
leaner cost structure and a growing customer base, the company is
now on solid footing, said Fred Horowitz, Netgrocer's president and
chief executive, who noted that the average order price has risen
to more than $60 from $49 in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're built for people who like to cheat in the express
lane,'' Horowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Losses per order have dropped to $1 from $4, and ``our goal is
that this business can be profitable in two years,'' Horowitz said
from the company's cavernous distribution center in North
Brunswick, N.J., where workers recently filled orders for
everything from shampoo to pasta sauce.
</P>
<P>
   For all its ambition, though, Netgrocer's experience so far
highlights the risky nature of a fledgling industry that, even if
ultimately successful, is likely to produce its share of
casualties, analysts said. Investors so far are not sold. Unlike
many other high-flying Internet stocks, shares of online grocers
have languished.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod's shares, which began trading in June 1997 at $16, now
trade for about $6. And Streamline's shares, which began trading
this June at $10, have since slumped to about $7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of an emerging business right now, and a couple of
new players are trying to get at it, and no one yet appears to have
the perfect model,'' said Ellen Baras, an analyst at William Blair
&AMP; Company who follows the business.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan (www.webvan.com), for one, has had trouble sticking to
its promise to fill orders in 30 minutes, and customers who order
Coke sometimes wind up with Pepsi, analysts said. A Webvan
spokesman said the company, whose founder, chairman and chief
executive is Lewis Borders, co-founder of Borders Books, is in a
``quiet period'' because of its pending stock offering and could
not comment.
</P>
<P>
   For these businesses, ``there are a couple of things going on,''
said Ms. Baras of William Blair. ``First of all, the business
models are being refined and, two, a lot of customers are still
getting used to the concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Loida Brisbane of Long Island are sold on the idea.
``Because we have a baby and both work and everything, it just
happens to be more convenient than always having to go to the
grocery store, so we thought we'd give it a try,'' said Brisbane,
37, a junior high school principal in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes my life a lot easier,'' agreed Mrs. Brisbane, 38, a
police officer in Queens. In the three months the family has been
using Peapod after learning about it from a television commercial,
she said, it has freed up more time for ``just hanging out and
going out to dinner together.''

LOTUS GIVES UP ON ESUITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, eSuite was one of the most highly touted software
projects at Lotus Development Corp. But Thursday Lotus officially
declared that eSuite is dead, victim of a computer market that
hasn't embraced the idea of super-simple ``network computers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lotus has decided to redeploy most of the developing and
marketing resources'' devoted to eSuite, said company spokesman
Paul Labelle. The team will be put to work on more successful Lotus
products, such as the company's Domino and Notes software for
helping computer users work together in teams.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus eSuite was a set of simple office programs, including word
processors and spreadsheets, which relied on the Java computing
system invented by Sun Microsystems Inc. One advantage of Java
programs is that they can run on many kinds of computers without
modification. Lotus introduced eSuite in 1997 in an early attempt
to use Java to build simple software that could run on any machine.
</P>
<P>
   It was also an effort to support the then-fashionable idea of
network computers. Lotus' parent company, IBM Corp., was a major
producer of these stripped-down devices that contain computer
processors but no desktop disk drives for storing software.
</P>
<P>
   An eSuite user wouldn't need a hard drive, buy instead would
connect an inexpensive network computer to a more powerful server
computer. The server would send eSuite programs to the user's
network computer as needed. And since all software would be
centralized, program upgrades would be cheap and simple.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus also produced a set of tools so companies could create
their own eSuite software. These tools would make it easy to build
small Java programs and bind them together to create customized
programs that could perform multiple tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for IBM and Lotus, network computers haven't
caught on. The price of desktop personal computers began to decline
sharply in 1997, to where many full-fledged computers became as
cheap or cheaper than network computers. Also, users complained
that Java-based software such as eSuite often ran much more slowly
than standard desktop computer software.
</P>
<P>
   ``eSuite from the very start was tied intimately to the network
computer,'' said Mark Levitt, research director for collaborative
computing at International Data Corp. ``But as of today, the PC
still dominates.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotus isn't alone in giving up writing office software in Java.
Both Corel Computer Corp. and Oracle Corp. also tried it and
failed.
</P>
<P>
   But Lotus' Labelle said the effort hasn't been a total failure.
``eSuite technology still remains compelling in the marketplace,''
he said, adding that features developed for eSuite will turn up in
other products produced by the Cambridge, Mass. software firm.

PRINCIPLES CAN HURT IN FANTASY PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE DONDONEAU 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There is a new fantasy-football game being played in
Seattle these days. It's called ``The principle of the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a very long-running show.
</P>
<P>
   It stars Seahawks receiver Joey Galloway, playing the part of a
money-hungry/get-no-respect contract holdout, and Mike Holmgren,
the new, head-strong Seahawks general manager and coach, better
known as the guy wearing one too many hats or the Franchise Savior.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway's holdout isn't just about money anymore. It is the
principle of the matter. Two egos have clashed. Holmgren and
Galloway have apparently stopped talking, and, by all local radio
and TV reports, negotiations are said to have either stalled or
moved into reverse. There is no pro-Galloway support in Seattle.
The talk shows are riding him; the newspapers are running ``where's
Joey'' updates.
</P>
<P>
   The trade talks? Holmgren has made it clear he would rather make
Galloway sit out all season than let a player dictate a trade,
especially in Holmgren's first contract squabble as general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   If you drafted Galloway in your fantasy league, be prepared to
be without him for at least two weeks. How the Seahawks fare
against Detroit and Chicago in their first two games could
determine which side caves in. It is, after all, ``the principle of
the matter.'' Fantasy fodder
</P>
<P>
   Our football league is holding its draft tomorrow, so we should
have the benefit of the latest injury and holdout news. We have a
high-scoring point system, awarding a point per yard and 50 points
per touchdown. Interceptions are minus-20, and interceptions
returned for touchdowns are minus-50. I'm drafting 12th in our
12-team league. ... According to reports out of Oakland, Rickey
Dudley is in coach Jon Gruden's doghouse and Jeremy Brigham will
soon be the Raiders' tight end. ... Oops, I goofed. While I think
Drew Bledsoe is one of the top seven fantasy quarterbacks, I
omitted him from my rankings in Week 1 of this report. ...
Washington running back Skip Hicks had a terrible preseason,
opening the door for Stephen Davis at tailback. They may split
time, but Hicks is still impressive around the goal line. ... I was
told and told and told by friends in Seattle this week to watch
tight end Itula Mili. He missed last season with a knee injury, but
the Seahawks are high on him, and starter Christian Fauria hasn't
lived up to expectations. ... Look for Terry Allen to boost New
England's running game, but rookie Kevin Faulk's versatility could
be the key to the team's ground game. ... Fred Taylor is the man in
Jacksonville, but Tavian Banks' play-making ability has supposedly
made James Stewart expendable. Trade soon? ... Saints running back
Ricky Williams is a workhorse, but if he plays this weekend he may
hurt his chances this season for a full recovery from his high
ankle sprain. Maybe his contract incentives are clouding his
judgment. Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Matthew Hatchette had a
similar injury in August and hasn't been practicing because of it.
Then again, that's the luxury of having Randy Moss, Cris Carter and
Jake Reed as your teammates. ... Jets running back Curtis Martin
may lose some playing time around the goal line. Some reports say
he's lost his push and reserves Leon Johnson and Jerald Sewell
could get some short-yardage TDs. ... The sleeper pick might be
Detroit Lions wide receiver Germaine Crowell. His big-play ability
may have knocked Johnnie Morton to No. 3 on the depth chart. ...
Speaking of wide receivers, the Buffalo Bills may have the most
underrated group, with Eric Moulds, Andre Reed and rookie Peerless
Price. Doug Flutie was finally named the starter and has plenty of
targets to work his magic with this season. Week 1 To play or not
to play... Wide receiver Bargain: Herman Moore, Lions. Barry who?
When it comes to opening days, nobody does it better than Moore. In
the past six years he has caught 48 passes for 700 yards and seven
touchdowns. He also has had five 100-yard receiving games. Can he
beat a solid Seahawks secondary with Charlie Batch throwing and no
Barry Sanders to relieve the pressure? Bust: O.J. McDuffie,
Dolphins. He'll be a solid pick throughout the season, but against
Denver's corners he lacks the speed to get open. Running back
Bargain: Duce Staley, Eagles. He'll probably get 20-plus carries
and in an early game like this, Philly's defense may be dictating
the field possession against the young Arizona Cardinals. Bust:
Antowain Smith, Bills. Another great pick for the season, but he
didn't show anything in the preseason and is going against a
much-improved Indianapolis defense. Quarterback Bargain: Brad
Johnson, Redskins. A Cowboys defense without Deion Sanders leaves
safety Darren Woodson as the only playmaker. When Johnson is
healthy he proved in Minnesota to be a top quarterback. Key: When
he's healthy. Which he is. He loves his tight ends and should be a
godsend for wide receiver Michael Westbrook. Bust: Rich Gannon,
Raiders. If the Raiders are pinning their hopes to this journeyman,
this team is in trouble. Opening at Green Bay may be one of the
toughest jobs in the NFL.

LAWMAKERS SWIFTLY PASS SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY REVAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Working against a federal deadline to craft a bill
that protects both public safety and privacy rights, the
Massachusetts Legislature Thursday speedily approved a major
overhaul of the sex-offender registry.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci is expected to sign the law Friday,
barely in time to meet a Sunday deadline set by the US Department
of Justice to receive a $1.1 million grant linked to a working
sex-offender registry.
</P>
<P>
   But more important than the funding, legislators said, the law
will revive a sex-offender board that quietly stopped functioning
after the Supreme Judicial Court ruled last month that all
offenders are entitled to a hearing before being entered on the
publicly accessible registry.
</P>
<P>
   However, even with the law, the expanded board might need months
to re-register offenders and make all information available to the
public about known sexual predators in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The new law addresses the SJC's concerns about due process,
lawmakers said, as well as enacting get-tough provisions that
include civil commitment in a locked, state-run treatment center
ranging from one day to a lifetime for sex criminals deemed too
dangerous to be released into society after they complete their
prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also mandates supervised lifetime parole for
violent sex criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very good measures that protect the public safety,''
Cellucci said of civil commitment and lifetime parole, both of
which he championed. ``Fixing the sex-offender registry so we can
make it work ... so parents can know whether offenders live in
their neighborhoods is also very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Robert A. Bernstein, a Worcester Democrat who led the
Senate team in negotiations that extended late into Wednesday
night, also hailed the new bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bill that we think, first and foremost, is a public
safety home run,'' he said .
</P>
<P>
   The law also provides additional protections for the privacy
rights of offenders who commit the least-dangerous crimes. These
offenders, classified as the first of three levels of criminals,
will now have their personal data distributed only to law
enforecment officials. Previously, this information was generally
available to members of the public who inquired at their local
police station.
</P>
<P>
   For level three offenders, the most dangerous sexual predators,
police are required to actively disseminate information to the
community through fliers, cable television announcements and other
public means.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Paul R. Haley, a Weymouth Democrat who heads the
House Ways and Means Committee, said the bill could carry a $10
million annual pricetag to fund an expanded, full-time board that
now needs to start anew as it re-registers and classifies 13,000
sex offenders in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The part-time board created in 1996 had registered 8,000
offenders and classified about 1,400 people according to their
degree of potential public danger before the SJC ruling stopped its
activities last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are aware that this costs money, but protecting the
citizens of the Commonwealth costs money,'' Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Money played a role in quickening the State House talks,
although Bernstein said the prospect of losing the annual $1.1
million federal grant was not deemed critical. To qualify for the
funds, the names of sex offenders must appear on a state registry
immediately after conviction. Lawmakers in Massachusetts faced a
dilemma about how to comply with that mandate and also satisfy the
SJC's directive that a hearing must be held before registration.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, offenders will be required to mail in a
perfunctory list of personal data to the state's Sex Offender
Registry Board, which will not be allowed to distribute the
information to local police until after the registration hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators praised the compromise, worked out with the Attorney
General's Office, but the head of the state's public defenders
organization said the law is likely to be struck down again.
</P>
<P>
   ``My prediction is that this bill is like its predecessor. It is
extremely likely to be stillborn,'' said William Leahy, chief
counsel for the Committee for Public Counsel Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This automatic mailing registration requirement is in absolute
noncompliance with the unanimous SJC decision, which speaks very
specifically to the constitutional rights which are impacted by the
registration process itself,'' said Leahy, who added he had not yet
read the entire law.
</P>
<P>
   Haley said he is ``cautiously optimistic'' that the law will
survive any constitutional challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The Criminal Justice Policy Coalition, which is affiliated with
the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, also
criticized the law for making the registry's sex offenses
retroactive to at least 1981. Anyone convicted, or on probation or
parole, for a sex crime since that year is eligible to be placed on
the registry.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Saloom, the coalition's executive director, said such a
broad sweep means that some crimes committed in the 1960s, for
which offenders were on parole in 1981, will still affect the lives
of otherwise law-abiding citizens today.

 &HT;    CLINTON PRESSES PACKAGE OF GUN-CONTROL MEASURES
 &HT;    450&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton fired a three-round attack on gun
violence Thursday, aiming to buy up to 300,000 firearms from city
streets, put 1,600 more police on the beat and press a reluctant
House to tighten federal weapons controls.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by 81 mayors and police chiefs from around the country,
Clinton said the measures are needed to help prevent the kinds of
shootings that have rocked Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles and other
cities this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been reminded in recent months, from Los Angeles to
Littleton to Atlanta,'' Clinton said. ``Gun violence is still too
much a part of America's life.''
</P>
<P>
   One step toward reducing that, Clinton said, is to sweep city
streets of guns that people are willing to surrender in exchange
for cash or coupons for food, toys or clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Under a program to be administered by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, Clinton is making $15 million immediately
available to local police departments for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Individual departments would be eligible for up to $500,000 each
_ enough, HUD estimates, to purchase up to 10,000 guns at an
average cost of $50 per weapon.
</P>
<P>
   While individual localities have reported success in similar
programs, this would be the single largest gun purchase program in
the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also announced $146 million in federal grants to enable
cities to hire nearly 1,600 additional police officers, including
750 to monitor classrooms and hallways in public schools. Under
this ongoing program, federal money has been used to add 100,000
new police to city forces across the country since Clinton
initiated it, with congressional approval, five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has asked Congress for funding to provide up to 50,000
additional police over the next five years. He said such funding
would be placed in jeopardy by Republican tax cut proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the number of guns on the streets and adding to local
police forces, Clinton said, are only small portions of what's
needed to reduce gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Also needed, he said, are laws that would strengthen controls on
the sale of weapons at gun shows, require childproof safety locks
for all handguns and prohibit the import of ammunition clips
holding more than 10 bullets at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unconscionable'' for Congress not to pass those
measures, Clinton said, putting extra stress on the need for gun
show controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need legislation that applies to all gun shows,'' he said,
``not a bill that allows criminals to turn flea markets and parking
lots into open-air gun bazaars.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks during a media event at the Old
Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has passed a comprehensive juvenile crime bill that
contains all three measures Clinton is seeking. Legislation in the
House contains none of them.
</P>
<P>
   A conference committee has been named to try to work out the
differences between the two bills, but no action has been scheduled
by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a member of the conference committee,
accused Clinton of grandstanding on the crime issue, launching a
``crackdown on law-abiding gun owners,'' and failing to
aggressively enforce existing federal gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``While President Clinton has been planning and conducting photo
ops at the White House, his administration has cut the prosecution
rate for lying to acquire a firearm in half since 1992,'' Barr said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with the mayors and police chiefs at the White House
on Thursday to try to rally their support for those measures. The
group left the White House for a day of lobbying on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they really see the light here ... and do what's
right,'' said Randall Mills, mayor of Conyers, Ga., scene of a mass
shooting at a high school last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you read the juvenile bill, it's not about gun control;
it's about gun safety,'' said Mills. ``If you can save one child
... this is common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most important issues for cities,'' said
Clarence E. Anthony, mayor of South Bay, Fla., and president of the
National League of Cities. ``It's important because of our
children, safety, and it's important for the growth and safety of
our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said the continuing gun-related
violence sweeping the country has built a strong constituency for
tightening gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task for us is to make certain that we get something
done,'' said Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rarely members of Congress that are going to funerals on
a local level,'' Campbell said after meeting with Clinton. ``That
falls to mayors and police chiefs. We are burying our people. We
are burying our children. ... It's a moral outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hightower, vice chairman of the Fulton County Board of
Commissioners in Atlanta, said he would propose in a meeting next
Wednesday that the board pass a resolution endorsing the
gun-control package Clinton seeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely important issue to Atlanta, to Fulton
County and to America,'' said Hightower, standing on the North Lawn
shortly after the White House meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the $146 million that's going to be targeted
toward cops in schools,'' said Hightower.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of police monitoring public school classrooms and
hallways is controversial, Hightower said, but has become necessary
because ``the reality is before us.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said ``there's a double sense of frustration,'' with
Congress, centered on the House refusal to back the three gun
control measures Clinton has endorsed and budget proposals that
threaten federal funding for hiring additional police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling,'' said Campbell, who said Clinton's
program for hiring additional police ``arguably has been the most
successful crime-fighting tool in the history of America.''

DANFORTH SAYS HE'LL FIND ANSWERS TO WACO'S `DARK QUESTIONS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newly appointed special counsel John Danforth vowed
Thursday to ask the ``dark questions'' of whether the government
shot or burned to death the Branch Davidians in the 1993 siege
outside Waco, Texas, and then tried to cover up its acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of government is to protect the life and liberty
and the pursuit of happiness of the American people,'' Danforth
said at a news conference announcing his appointment. ``If
government doesn't do that, if government covers things up, if
government kills people. . .then that undermines. . .the very
foundation of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno introduced Danforth, then said she
will recuse herself from all administrative supervision of the Waco
probe.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was the key decision-maker in the FBI's move to end the
51-day siege by using tanks to punch holes in the walls and spray
tear gas into the compound of the Davidians. The seige began after
a shootout that left six members of the religious cult and four
federal agents dead.
</P>
<P>
   At an impromptu news conference outside the White House Thursday
afternoon, President Clinton called Danforth ``an honorable man and
an intelligent and straightforward man. The only thing I would ask
is that he conduct a thorough and prompt investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added that ``I certainly don't think there's any
reason'' for Reno to resign, as several Republican leaders have
urged.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, 63, a former Republican senator from Missouri, will be
assisted by Edward Dowd, the US attorney in St. Louis who is
stepping down to serve as deputy special counsel of the
investigation. Dowd is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he did not intend to reopen the debate over the
judgment calls made by Reno, the FBI, and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms to raid the compound in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are going to be looking at is whether there were bad
acts, not whether there was bad judgment. Our country can survive
bad judgment,'' Danforth said. ``The thing that really undermines
the integrity of government is whether there were bad acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to answer the dark questions,'' Danforth said. ``Was
there a coverup? That's a dark question. Did the government kill
people? How did the fire start? And, was there shooting?''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's appointment was hailed by Democrats and Republicans
on Capitol Hill. House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, a Democrat
from Missouri, said in an interview that his former colleague was
``an excellent appointment.'' ``I have nothing but respect for his
ability and character,'' he said. Gephardt also vouched for Dowd,
whose name he gave to President Clinton as a potential US attorney
at the start of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, an ordained Episcopalian priest and the father of five
children, earned a reputation for probity, moderation, and
intelligence during his 18 years in the Senate. He is a former
Missouri attorney general, now in private law practice, who
graduated from Yale University's law and divinity schools. In 1991,
Danforth shepherded the controversial Supreme Court nomination of
his friend, Clarence Thomas, to victory in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's appointment of Danforth did not stifle Republican critics
in Congress, who have called for her to resign and announced their
own plans to investigate the Waco assault. The attorney general
said Thursday that she would not resign: ``I don't run from
controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he expects to complete his investigation before
the end of the Clinton administration in January 2001. Danforth
will have full subpoena power and the authority to convene a grand
jury to hear sworn and secret testimony for potential criminal
prosecution, but he said that a public airing of the facts is his
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to produce something the American people can
see,'' Danforth said. Because the independent counsel statute has
expired, Danforth will be operating under Justice Department rules
for special counsels, which would require approval from Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder before filing any criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the FBI's role, Danforth will rely on private lawyers
and investigators and agents from other federal law enforcement
agencies. ``The FBI should not be investigating the FBI,'' he said.
The investigation will also review the role of the armed forces in
the siege at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he took the job because of a feeling of duty and
obligation. ``As a friend of mine said, this is not a good career
move,'' he acknowledged. ``Hey, I'm 63. I'm beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous investigations determined that members of the Branch
Davidians responded to the FBI's assault by setting fire to their
wooden compound and, in many cases, shooting themselves or each
other to death. More than 80 people died in the course of the
assault on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, the FBI has maintained that its agents did not
set fire to the compound, or shoot at the group members trying to
escape the flames. But last month, the bureau disclosed that FBI
agents shot two military-style gas cannisters, which under some
conditions might cause a fire, at a concrete bunker apart from the
compound four hours before the blaze broke out.
</P>
<P>
   There is as yet no evidence tying the gas canisters, or any
other ordnance used by the FBI that day, to the conflagration. But
the FBI's tardy disclosure triggered calls of a coverup by
high-ranking Republicans and conspiracy theorists.

SOME ATTRIBUTE MOSCOW BLAST TO ELECTION SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The deadly explosion that ripped through a nine-story
apartment building here early Thursday morning was caused by a
bomb, officials said after finding traces of an explosive substance
at the site.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the FSB domestic security service dismissed
earlier theories that a gas leak was to blame and said the
explosion was caused by ``either an industrially produced explosive
or a mixture of explosive substances.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said the blast, which killed at least
32 people and inured scores more, was caused by hexogen, a plastic
explosive often used in military operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is possible to claim with the highest degree of
certainty that this was an act of sabotage, this was a terrorist
act,'' Luzhkov said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Thursday, investigators pored through the
smoking wreckage of the gutted apartment building in southeastern
Moscow, searching for clues as to what caused the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people are still buried under the rubble, but rescue
workers say there is little hope of finding any survivers.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officlas said the explosion could have been
linked to tensions in Dagestan, where Russian forces are battling
Islamic militants. The Interfax news agency reported receiving an
anonymous call claiming responsibilty for the blast, saying it was
retaliation for Russia's bombing ``peaceful villages'' in Dagestan
and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But some seasoned Muscovites have a more cynical explanation for
the blast: election season. Moscow wouldn't be Moscow if there
wasn't a conspiracy theory to explain the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The blast at the apartment building occurred just ten days after
a bomb ripped through a video arcade in an upscale shopping center
in downtown Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Ilyukhin, a leading Communist lawmaker in Russia's
parliament, suggested that the explosions were a message from the
Kremlin to Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Luzhkov values the lives and health of his Muscovites,
then he needs to curtail his political opposition,'' said Ilyukhin
in remarks reported by news agencies here.
</P>
<P>
   A fierce Kremlin critic, Luzhkov last month forged a political
alliance with Russia's popular former prime minister, Yevgeny
Primakov, and the country's powerful regional leaders. Analysts say
the party could dominate elections to Parliament in December and
eventually catapult Luzhkov into the Kremlin in next summer's
presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I categorically reject the very idea of connecting what
happened to upcoming elections,'' Luzhkov said Thursday. The mayor
went on to question Ilyukhin's sanity, suggesting he ``undergo an
examination in the Moscow health care department.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as crazy as this may sound, when the political temperature
rises in Russia Moscow experiences its share of unexplained
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, for example _ when Russia last held presidential
elections _ a bomb in Moscow's subway killed four people and
injured 12. That same summer, 38 people were hurt in two explosions
on municipal buses.
</P>
<P>
   And in April of this year, as Russia's parliament was trying to
impeach Yeltsin, a bomb exploded at the office building of the
Federal Security Service, the successor to the Soviet KGB.
</P>
<P>
   No suspects were ever detained in any of those explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the paranoid atmosphere in Russia's jittery capital,
the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported Wednesday, citing
intelligence and military sources, that secret troop mobilizations
were underway in Moscow for possile use in a ``political war''
between Yeltsin and his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This all sounds a bit crazy but then again, Russia is a crazy
country,'' Boris Kagarlitsky, a Moscow-based political analyst,
Kagarlitsky said. ``In Russia, the question is never whether or not
a conspiracy is afoot, but rather which one of many conspiracies is
actually working.''

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ When reports swirled here on Wednesday that
Indonesia's President, B.J. Habibie, was about to resign, some of
his advisers detected the handiwork of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military is strongly against allowing peacekeeping troops
into East Timor,'' said Umar Juoro, an economic adviser to Habibie.
``It is most likely that people in the military are spreading the
rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Juoro's suspicions, which are shared by many in Jakarta,
underscore the fact that the army has emerged once again as the
central player in a national crisis. With East Timor under martial
law and with Habibie's ability to control events there doubtful,
the fate of this ravaged province rests more than ever with the
military and its taciturn supreme commander, Gen. Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto insists that fresh troops can halt the killing and
looting in East Timor without outside help, if given enough time.
But military experts said the general was struggling to curb rogue
field commanders, who fiercely opposed East Timor's recent
independence vote and are taking their revenge by joining with
local militias to reduce the province to ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Juoro said they were also trying to bully Habibie into rejecting
calls for an international peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wiranto is in a position where the commanders on the ground
are humiliated and angry by the rejection of the East Timorese,''
said Harold Crouch, an expert on the Indonesian military at the
Australian National University in Canberra. ``He has to move very
carefully with these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the chaos following the vote announcement, Wiranto has
made some progress in asserting his control. On Wednesday, he
appointed Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri to restore order and public
services. Syahnakri served 11 years in East Timor and speaks the
local language, Tetum. But more important, he is regarded as loyal
to Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian officials insisted on Thursday that the military was
not riven by dissension or bent on vengeance in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military as an institution, the police as an institution,
are not in support of the people burning and killing and looting,''
the foreign minister, Ali Alatas, said after meeting a U.N.
delegation here. ``These are criminal activities and we are going
to put a stop to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Alatas conceded there might be rogue elements among the
300,000 people who make up the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Juoro said, ``There continues to be a split between the
commanders in Jakarta and the field commanders, who are
hard-liners. Right now, it appears the hard-liners are quite
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto, 53, has been tangling with the hard-liners since May
1998, when he engineered the army's response to a mounting student
movement. While Wiranto supported Suharto, Indonesia's president at
the time, he fended off military leaders who wanted to crush the
students when it became clear that they were going to drive Suharto
from office.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16 months since then, Wiranto has worked to create a new
role for the army in a more democratic Indonesia. He has accepted a
diminution of the army's traditional role in politics _ agreeing to
a cut in its allotted parliamentary seats, to 38 from 75. Officers
have also been forced to give up privileged posts in provincial
governments and state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said Wiranto was able to sell this plan to the troops by
winning concessions from Suharto's successor, Habibie. Among the
most important was that Jakarta give the military a relatively free
hand in Indonesia's hot spots, the separatist provinces of East
Timor and Aceh.
</P>
<P>
   The army's conduct in both places has been exposed to
remorseless scrutiny in the last year. Pictures of mass graves
being dug up in Aceh tarnished the military's cherished self-image
as a friend of the people. Resistance leaders in East Timor spoke
out forcefully against a quarter-century of repression.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the army's leaders clung to their prerogatives. A tour of
duty in East Timor is regarded as a prerequisite for senior
officers, including Wiranto, who commanded a battalion there.
</P>
<P>
   That explains why many army officers were outraged when Habibie
abruptly announced in January that the government would allow East
Timor to hold a referendum on whether to leave Indonesia. Their
anger deepened when the East Timorese voted in overwhelming numbers
to break away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the military thought they would win the vote in East
Timor,'' Crouch said. ``They were misled by their intelligence
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Crouch suggested that Wiranto might have decided to tolerate a
certain level of reprisals in East Timor as a way for his
lieutenants to blow off steam. But if so, the strategy has clearly
spun out of control. ``The damage is done,'' he said. ``They've
looted everything in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts and even former military officers said they feared that
the slaughter in East Timor could set back Wiranto's efforts to
carve a new role for the military in Indonesian society.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Wiranto has got to stop the killing,'' said A. Kemal
Idris, a former lieutenant general who once commanded the Army
Strategic Reserves. ``It whll give a bad impression to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Idris said East Timor was the latest in a series of incidents _
including the unearthing of graves in Aceh and the shooting of
students in Jakarta last November _ that had eroded the public's
faith in the military. ``The people are asking themselves, `Can we
trust the army now?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before this week, experts were talking about how the army had a
rare opportunity to influence Indonesia's political future. Despite
having fewer seats in Parliament, the army could potentially act as
a swing vote in an election between Habibie and his leading
opponent, Megawati Sukarnoputri. Wiranto had often been mentioned
as a vice presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Crouch said, ``instead of being seen as heroes, the
army could be seen as the people who destroyed East Timor.''

FIRM CLAIMS MAJOR STEP TOWARD MAPPING HUMAN DNA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A biotech company that's racing the federal government to
decipher all the human genes has reached an important milestone
along the way, officials of the firm announced Thursday: It has
translated the entire 1.8 million-unit-long DNA blueprint of the
fruit fly.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic blueprint of the fly, known as Drosophila
melanogaster, is the largest yet deciphered of any organism, said
scientists at Celera Genomics of Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The company said in a statement that it has completed the
sequencing phase of the Drosophila project. ``Sequencing'' is the
process of finding the order of different chemical units in genes _
the units are analogous to letters in a word, and their order
determines their meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Genes contain the recipes for the thousands of proteins that
make up the fly's body and control its operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly an important milestone along the way to the
final product,'' said Gerald Rubin, a researcher who heads the
Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project at the University of California
in Berkeley. The Berkeley project is collaborating with Celera in
the sequencing effort.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have read out the genetic code of the fly, Celera
scientists still have a major challenge ahead: That is to put back
together about 3 million pieces of DNA into which the blueprint was
chopped for sequencing. This so-called ``shotgun'' approach of
breaking up the genome into tiny pieces for automated sequencing is
Celera's strategy for beating the government in the human
sequencing race.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it expects to accomplish this reassembly, with
aid of enormously powerful computers, by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, at Berkeley, said that until Celera scientists show they
can put the 3 million pieces of the genetic puzzle back together,
they won't have proved that their method is the best.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the genome can be compared to translating an enormous
book in a foreign language. First, they cut up the book into small
pieces that can be handled by the gene-reading machines. Then they
go letter by letter, translating the genetic code into chemical
terms. Then they have to put the pieces back together in the
correct order so the writing makes sense. That's what Celera has
yet to do.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that by finishing the fly genome sequencing, it
can now turn its powerful automated gene-reading machines over to
the ultimate task of reading out the 3 billion letters in the human
genome. Celera's president, J. Craig Venter, has vowed that the
company, using hundreds of automated sequencers, will read the 3
billion letters in the human genome (an estimated 80,000 to 100,000
genes) by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   This assertion is a challenge to the US government-funded Human
Genome Project, which is now scheduled to be finished in 2002.
However, the government says it will have a ``rough draft'' of the
human genome, with more than 90 percent of genes sequenced, by next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fruit fly is genetically comparable to humans in
many ways, but can be experimented on in ways that humans can't,
the insect has been a workhorse for genetic experiments. Of about
120 human disease genes that have been sequenced, 75 are similar to
those found in the fruit fly, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having the sequence will really move Drosophila
research and genetics into a whole new speed,'' said Terry
Orr-Weaver, a scientist at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Celera has made it possible for a few ``subscribers'' to receive
the fruit fly sequence information before it is released publicly,
beginning in October. The subscribers, who pay for early access,
include several large pharmaceutical companies, said Mark Adams, a
Celera vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The preview privilege means that the companies could identify
genes with potential commercial value, and patent them before most
other researchers can view the data. Adams said the companies are
interested in fruit fly genes that are comparable to those involved
in humans' diseases, because it would help them design new drugs.

opening of a safe passage route between the West Bank and Gaza. For

SOX-YANKEES RIVALRY NOT AS SHARP, BUT STILL HAS AN EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stakes dropped dramatically on the day the Red
Sox departed the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Their loss to Oakland, coupled with the Yankees' win over Kansas
City Wednesday night, took some of the edge off this weekend's
three-game set with the Bombers, who might have been forced to fend
off an unexpected challenge to their American League East
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with the Yankees' lead up to 6 1/2 games over the
second-place Sox, Boston could come in and sweep and the Yankees
still would be holding service in the division with three weeks to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the subtexts of this rivalry remain as rich as ever.
There's Nomar Garciaparra and Derek Jeter, tied for the American
League batting lead at .353 while jockeying for position in the
league MVP race. Garciaparra sat out Wednesday after fouling a ball
off his left ankle Tuesday night, but there's as much chance of
Garciaparra missing this series as Boss Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   There's Pedro Martinez, Boston's best hope for a Red October,
opening the series Friday night in search of his 21st win, and
Roger Clemens, who has been a sputtering Rocket for much of this
season, closing it on Sunday against lefthander Kent Mercker,
sandwiched around Bret Saberhagen's return to the Sox rotation
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have a limping Bernie Williams, the defending AL
batting champion who has tendinitis in his left shoulder but says
he'll play Friday. The Red Sox will still be missing third baseman
John Valentin, who is on the disabled list with patellar tendinitis
in his left knee but is expected to show up for moral support.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees recently welcomed back Darryl Strawberry, a penitent
more times than he has been an All-Star. The Red Sox are still
awaiting the Belleville Basher, Brian Daubach, to resurface, though
there were small hints (a few good swings in addition to his
pop-fly double Wednesday in Oakland) that Daubach may regain his
stroke before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   There remains urgent business, of course, for the Sox to
address. While Oakland plays a baker's dozen against the American
League's bottom feeders _ four against Tampa Bay in St. Petersburg,
Fla., three against the Orioles in Baltimore, then back home for
three against the Royals and three against the Twins _ the Sox will
try to maintain their three-game lead in the wild-card race while
on the road facing the iron of the AL, the Yankees and Cleveland
Indians, who begin the weekend with the league's best record.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are at the midpoint of a 12-game, 13-day trip in which
they've taken three of four from Seattle and split two in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's basically talking about the wild card, but not
us,'' Saberhagen said. ``But with everybody talking about it so
much, it's tough to get it out of your mind, and you lose focus on
what you want to do, which is win the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, this is very big. If we expect to make up ground on
them, realistically we have to take all three games. The chances of
that happening? I don't know where the moon's at, and the stars are
aligned, but they're a pretty tough club to come in and expect to
take three from. That may not be realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to win two out of three, you're only picking up a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Why even worry about winning the division if the wild card gains
you entry to the postseason?
</P>
<P>
   ``For your mind frame,'' Saberhagen said. ``If we were able to
catch the Yankees and finish first, it would be a huge lift for the
team. It would also mean we'd be playing well going into the
postseason. Even if we don't catch them, we may still be playing
well going into the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette on numerous occasions last
season claimed his team matched up well against the Yankees, even
as they were setting a record for wins in a season. This year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we match up a little better this year than last
year,'' Duquette said. ``We match up well against all the top clubs
in the league pretty well _ Texas, Cleveland, and the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, who rarely travels with the club, has been with the
team the entire trip and will be in attendance here as well. His
assessment?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pitching's been good so far,'' Duquette said. ``Our
pitching depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're OK so far. We've played some good games. I'm pretty
satisfied.''

USE OF FICTION IN CORPORATE ACCOUNTING WILL GO ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ninety-two years ago, a federal prosecutor working on a case
against John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co. demanded to know
just how much money the company had made from 1903 to 1905.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see you in hell first,'' replied John S. Miller, a
Standard Oil lawyer, as recalled in Ron Chernow's biography of
Rockefeller, ``Titan.'' The company successfully defied a judge's
order to produce the figures.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's frankness might not be found in corporate America
today, but his spirit lives on. Companies report profits now, of
course, but many believe they have a right to manage those numbers
as they wish. There are lots of gimmicks that can be used _ some of
them visible and many not. When accounting rule makers try to do
something about it, they must worry that corporate America will use
political influence to get the rules changed.
</P>
<P>
   That is the background to the battle now being waged over merger
accounting. The Financial Accounting Standards Board voted
unanimously this week to bar a disreputable form of accounting
known as pooling, a method companies love because it lets them
inflate future profits.
</P>
<P>
   But, clearly fearful that corporations will run to their friends
in Congress, the board threw in a sop to the companies: Under the
proposed rule, it will let them come up with a new, extra number
for per-share earnings that will be inflated by ignoring some
merger-related expenses. Whether that will be enough to avoid
congressional intervention remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Pooling accounting is ridiculous because it allows corporations
to pretend that they paid much less for an acquisition than they
did. Let's say Company A buys Company B for $100 million in stock,
and then, a few years later, sells Company B for $50 million. In
reality, it was a disastrous acquisition for Company A. But thanks
to the magic of pooling, Company A would have shown the original
acquisition as costing not the $100 million it actually paid but a
number that could be far lower _ say, $20 million _ reflecting the
book value of Company B. Presto: Company A gets to report a profit
of $30 million when it really lost $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even more pernicious is the fact that if a company is simply
selling assets acquired in a pooling merger, there is no way for
analysts to tell that the reported profits are completely phony.
For years ITT was able to manage reported profits by selling stocks
that had been owned by Hartford Insurance before ITT acquired it.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of flexibility is highly desired by corporate America,
and pooling is far from the only method used to produce a steady,
predictable stream of earnings from companies whose actual
businesses are not nearly so steady. This is well known on Wall
Street, and helps to explain why stocks get pummeled when a company
misses an earnings target by a penny a share. Traders assume that
the miss came after the company used every trick it could think of
to make the target, so the shortfall must have really been much
larger.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, has started a crusade against such fudges, with
speeches and some enforcement actions. Whether he will succeed is
unclear, in part because the best ways to manage reported profits
are so difficult to detect.
</P>
<P>
   In one pending S.E.C. enforcement case, former officials of W.R.
Grace &AMP; Co. are accused of fudging the books to hold down profits
on one year, so that the extra money could bolster earnings when
needed in future periods. That case has brought outrage from some
corporate officials, who see nothing unusual about what the Grace
officials are accused of doing.
</P>
<P>
   The death of pooling in 2001 _ which will occur if the
accounting board does not back down _ will be welcome. But it won't
end the artful use of fiction in accounting.
</P>

DANFORTH PROMISES TO ANSWER `THE DARK QUESTIONS' ABOUT WACO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Republican Sen. John Danforth launched his
investigation into the 1993 Waco siege on Thursday with a promise
to answer ``the dark questions'' left behind by a fire that
obliterated the Branch Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was there a cover-up? Did the government kill people? How did
the fire start? And was there shooting?'' Danforth asked, ticking
off the issues he hopes to resolve. ``Those are questions that go
to the basic integrity of government, not judgment calls.''
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the assignment from Attorney General Janet Reno,
Danforth expressed confidence that he will be able to use his
sweeping investigative powers without political interference. He
said he will focus almost exclusively on the events of April 19,
1993, the final day in a 51-day standoff between the FBI and
members of the Branch Davidian sect.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI contends that Branch Davidian leader David Koresh
ordered his followers to burn down their compound rather than
surrender to federal agents. The bodies of about 80 sect members,
including 20 children, were found in the charred remains.
</P>
<P>
   Reno recruited Danforth as an outside investigator after FBI
officials acknowledged that they had failed to disclose their use
of potentially flammable tear gas canisters on the final day of the
siege.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to looking for evidence of a cover-up and the cause
of the fire, the former Missouri lawmaker will look into
allegations that federal agents fired on the compound during their
final assault. He will also try to determine whether military
observers at the scene violated federal law by acting as law
enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come into this with a totally open mind,'' Danforth said,
with Reno standing at his side. ``I come into this with the notion
that the chips should fall where they may. And that's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans praised the appointment, but said they
would press ahead with their own investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has one task, we have another, but I have no doubt that
we'll be able to work in concert,'' said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.,
chairman of the House Government Reform Committee. The panel has
taken the lead in pursuing the issue in Congress by issuing
subpoenas for any relevant information from the FBI, the White
House, the Justice Department, the Pentagon and the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas called Danforth's
appointment ``an important step in the search for truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans said they would monitor Danforth's progress to
make sure that he is allowed to pursue leads without interference.
Because the federal independent counsel law has expired, Danforth
lacks the statutory independence that was granted to Kenneth Starr
and other previous outside investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But Danforth, who carries the title of special counsel, said he
is confident that Reno will fulfill her promise to give him free
rein. The former senator spent most of the week negotiating the
details of his appointment with the attorney general and her aides.
As a possible target of the inquiry, Reno said she will turn any
future decisions on Danforth's investigation over to Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder, who was not involved in the Waco
siege.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth will have the authority to use a federal grand jury in
his investigation, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   In another safeguard, Danforth said he will rely on
private-sector investigators rather than FBI agents for legwork in
his inquiry. U.S. Attorney Edward Dowd of St. Louis will resign his
federal job to serve as Danforth's chief assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the FBI should be investigating the FBI,''
Danforth said. He declined to set a timetable for his final report,
but he said he expects to complete his work well before the end of
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do everything I can to make sure that this is thorough.
I know that it will be objective. I know that I will call it as I
see it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Danforth also acknowledged that he will probably not be able
to satisfy both sides in the long-running debate over the
government's actions in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're going to be looking at is whether there were bad
acts, not whether there was bad judgment,'' he said. ``Our country
can survive bad judgment. But the thing that really undermines the
integrity of government is whether there were bad acts, whether
there was a cover-up (and) whether the government killed people.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers involved in previous Waco
investigations differed on the possibility that federal agents
might have triggered the fatal fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Davidians set those fires,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., a Reno critic who presided over 1995 hearings into the
siege. ``No new evidence has emerged in any of this, even if it
were all shown to be true, that would in any way effect that
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., said the belated revelations from
the FBI have left him uncertain about the government's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to conclude anything,'' Gekas said. ``The only
conclusion we can draw now is we did not receive a full slate of
necessary evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about who started the fire that destroyed the compound
began almost immediately. Branch Davidians who survived contended
that members of the group did not start the fire, as the FBI and
congressional committees later concluded.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 documentary by filmmaker Mike McNulty, ``Waco: Rules of
Engagement,'' raised more questions.
</P>
<P>
   The film, nominated for an Academy Award, uses clips from
infrared film taken by a government surveillance camera that some
experts say call into question whether agents fired into the
burning compound.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty is preparing to release a sequel to that documentary,
``Waco: A New Revelation,'' which he says will show the government
used pyrotechnic devices near the three spots where the fires
started.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ Iftikar Tayeh did not know if her husband
would be among the 199 Palestinian prisoners released Thursday by
the Israelis, but she and her 14-year-old son left their refugee
camp before dawn just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Mujahid, a gangly youth in a yellow tank top, was 4
months old when his father was imprisoned for killing a fellow
Palestinian he had believed to be a ``collaborator'' with the
Israelis. Mrs. Tayeh herself dropped out of a university philosophy
program to clean houses for the 13{ years that her husband was
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Neither wanted to miss the moment if it was to be theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the walled military compound of the Palestinian
Authority, a bagpipe band played triumphal music and women in
traditional embroidered dresses ululated as buses rolled in with
the former prisoners hanging out the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a worn Nike windbreaker, sweating profusely and looking
much older than his 40 years, Issa Ahmed Tayeh emerged into the
sunlight. His wife looked faint and his boy tackled him, weeping
and crying out that it was the first time he had ever hugged his
father _ who, serving a life sentence, he had presumed to be gone
for good.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Tayeh and 198 fellow prisoners, most like him
convicted of crimes against other Palestinians, was the first
concrete step in the revival of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
effort. Coming five days after a new peace agreement was signed in
Egypt, the event kicks off a packed schedule of changes, including
an imminent land transfer and the opening of a safe passage route
between the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians it was a day for dancing the debka and firing
celebratory gunshots into the air. But their joy was tempered by a
widespread disappointment with their leaders who, many think,
failed in negotiations to secure the release of enough prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   For Israelis, too, the reaction was a complicated mix of
emotions across the political spectrum. Many expressed relief that
the peace process was back under way, but the Jewish settlers who
watched the prisoners' buses leave an Israeli base in the West Bank
saw depressing proof that they were losing ground _ literally and
in their political battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli families of terror victims said they felt
wrenchingly betrayed by their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It returns me to very terrible days,'' said Esther Wachsman,
whose son Nachson was kidnapped and killed by terrorists in 1994.
``It awakens in me a feeling of injustice and immorality _ moral
bankruptcy, you could call it _ in a country that I so love and for
which my son gave his life.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Israelis, those released committed their crimes
before the Oslo peace agreement was signed in 1993. Palestinian
leaders were still committed then to a violent struggle against
Israel, and these were their foot soldiers. Most of those released
Thursday, like Tayeh, killed or injured Palestinians who ostensibly
cooperated with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Intensely sensitive for both sides, the issue of the prisoners'
release nearly derailed the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations last
week. Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, demanded 50 more
prisoners than the 350 the Israelis were willing to release _ in
two shifts _ knowing that his people would be disappointed even
with 400.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israelis said they could not find another 50 who met
their criteria _ that is, who had not been involved in the killing
of an Israeli or who were not members of the Islamic fundamentalist
opposition groups. Arafat relented.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the Palestinian leader was in Libya rather than at
his compound to welcome the men home. Some political analysts
theorized that he feared he would be jeered by the former
prisoners, whose first public words were expressions of solidarity
with the cellmates they had left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no parties tonight,'' Tayeh said as he climbed
into a dusty Mazda for the ride home. ``We will not celebrate until
the others are set free, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal signed early this week, Israel is also prepared
to transfer 7 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian civil
control. Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said Thursday that
Arafat would be presented the maps in the afternoon and that as
soon as they were jointly signed, the transfer would become
binding.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely 200 prisoners were to have been released Thursday, but
one man refused to be included, since his official release is
scheduled for next week anyway. He thought he could be replaced by
someone else but wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Before their release, the prisoners signed declarations that
they would refrain from taking part in acts of terror.
</P>
<P>
   Just as their eight buses were sailing through Israeli
checkpoints into Palestinian territory, the Israelis were sealing
the West Bank and Gaza before the Jewish New Year, which begins
Friday evening. Because of intelligence information about possible
terrorist attacks, the Israelis closed their borders to
Palestinians _ which is traditionally done around the holidays
anyway.

<P>
   As Tayeh's car pulled onto the rutted main road of the Qalandia
refugee camp between Ramallah and Jerusalem, past a busy soccer
field and storefronts plastered with yellowing pictures of Arafat,
guns were fired into the air and foil-wrapped candy rained down on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Camp residents surrounded him and trailed behind, kissing him on
both cheeks and pronouncing him seriously aged. At full speed,
tearing through the crowd and kicking bottles off the road, his
13-year-old daughter ran to greet him, pummeling him with
teary-eyed affection.
</P>
<P>
   She was born after her father was imprisoned. Her mother named
her Jihad, or Holy War. Jihad uses henna to streak her brown hair,
and her father told her she looked terribly grown up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only knew my dad through the wire windows that separated us
during visiting times at the prison,'' Jihad said. ``I feel he is a
little bit a stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Older women lined the steps up to Tayeh's home, singing and
proffering baskets filled with bonbons. His wife lugged bottles of
water into their apartment, which was decorated with
black-and-white photographs of other family members who had done
time in prison for the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had much help in these years moneywise,'' Mrs. Tayeh
said. ``But the love I received in the refugee camp helped me carry
on.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sank onto a sofa, surrounded by walls hung with beaded
paintings he had made in prison, Tayeh let out a deep breath. He
was reluctant to discuss the crimes that put him in jail.
</P>
<P>
   He said that they belonged to a different era, but that he
didn't regret them.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted of membership in an illegal military cell of
Arafat's Fatah organization as well as murder. With another member
of his cell, he killed a neighbor, he said _ a Palestinian who had
sold his land to the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man was a neighbor, and his family still lives here,'' he
said. ``I don't want to reopen this wound. But I don't regret what
I did. When you follow this road, you know it will not be paved
with flowers.''

COUNCILORS TO SCAN INMATE HIRING BY HIGH COURT NOMINEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Governor's councilors say they will scrutinize Francis
X. Spina's hiring of a convicted murderer as a paralegal before
deciding whether to confirm his nomination to the state's highest
court.
</P>
<P>
   But Governor Paul Cellucci Thursday said he was untroubled by
Spina's payment of nearly $20,000 in state funds to the imprisoned
murderer, which legal experts called highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   As a court-appointed attorney in the early 1990s, Spin hired
inmate Jerome Napolitano to conduct legal research in a drug case.
Spina said it was convenient to hire Napolitano, who was serving in
the same state prison as Spina's client, Francesco (Frank) Campiti,
a convicted cocaine trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported Thursday that Spina's payments violated
Department of Correction regulations that prohibit inmates from
being paid for legal services. Spina, who claimed he could not have
handled the complicated appeals case without Napolitano's legal
research, said he did not know of the regulations at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not have happened and Judge Spina has said he was
not aware of the prohibition. What more do we need to know?''
Cellucci said, when asked if he planned to make inquiries into the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said the issue did not come up in his discussions with
Spina when he was considering nominations to the Supreme Judicial
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not have impacted our decision,'' Cellucci said. ``I
am not going to second guess a decision by a trial attorney made
almost 10 years ago in trying to represent his client.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said Spina's role in the case points to one of the
reasons he chose him for the SJC: he has broad experience in the
legal profession, as a prosecutor, a defense lawyer, and a judge.
</P>
<P>
   But several members of the Governor's Council expressed concern
over the payments to Napolitano, who was convicted of killing two
people _ including a 16-year-old boy, in a brutal 1976 slaying
outside a Brighton night club. They said they want explanations
from Spina when his nomination gets a hearing before their panel
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Councilor Christopher A. Iannella, Jr., a Democrat from Jamaica
Plain, said Spina appears to have displayed poor judgment, but he
also said he did not think it would harm Spina's chances of
confirmation by the eight-member Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question it is not normal,'' said Iannella, a
Boston lawyer. ``In fairness, I want to hear his side of the story.
But, wow, it's not something I would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilor David Constantine, a Democrat from New Bedford, said
he wants to ``find out what went down'' before he votes on the
nomination. ``That's wrong, no question about that. That is very
much wrong,'' Constantine said.
</P>
<P>
   Spina was given the legal work by the Committee for Public
Counsel Services in August 1991. The case involved the 1988
conviction of mafia associate Francesco Campiti of Agawam, who was
sentenced to 40 to 60 years in prison for operating a
cocaine-importing ring.
</P>
<P>
   Campiti and his lawyers have argued that the judge in the case
should not have allowed the use of his tape-recorded conversation
as evidence in his trial. The case was upheld in the state appeals
court and is now before a federal judge in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Spina, who was paid $16,906 by public-counsel services and
billed the committee for $19,907 for Napolitano's work, dropped out
of the case in late 1992 when then-Governor William F. Weld
nominated him as a judge on the Superior Court. He said Campiti
recommended his fellow inmate as a legal assistant. Sources who
know him say Napolitano is well versed in legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   A rough calculation _ based on the $10 an hour rate over a
period of 17 months _ indicates Napolitano worked an average 25
hours a week on the case.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not clear how Napolitano, whose mail is monitored at
the prison, collected his payments from Spina. Through a court
spokesman, Spina said he did not remember how he conveyed the
paychecks to Napolitano, who is being held at the Bay State
Correctional Center in Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   A DOC spokesman, Anthony Carnevale, said the agency is not
allowed by law to discuss details in the case. Public counsel
records indicate Napolitano was disciplined by the corrections
department after the DOC discovered he had received a check for
work in the case.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ There were increasing reports Thursday of
an apparent campaign to kill Catholic priests and nuns in East
Timor, Indonesia's only predominantly Christian province, while
evidence accumulated that, under pressure from abroad, the military
command in Jakarta was slowly beginning to assert control in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican said Thursday that local Roman Catholic institutions
had been singled out for attack by the militias and called for a
United Nations peacekeeping force to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing another genocide. A genocide that does not spare
the Catholic Church,'' Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, the Vatican's
foreign minister, told Vatican Television.
</P>
<P>
   The church was responding specifically to reports of a slayings
of about 100 people, including four Catholic priests in an attack
on a church in the southern town of Suai.
</P>
<P>
   Another victim was said to be the head of the East Timorese
office of the Catholic aid agency Caritas, the Rev. Francisco
Barreto, a prominent voice for moderation in the territory. The
agency's office in Australia said several other local workers for
Caritas had also apparently been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center, based in Atlanta, reported that a well-known
nun had been killed in Dili. And in another report, the Rev. Jose
Carbonel of the Silesian order said in Jakarta that six nuns of the
Canossian order had been killed in the city of Baucau, where the
Roman Catholic bishop, Basilio do Nascimento, was reported on
Wednesday to have been wounded and forced to flee into the hills.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, armed militias burned the home of the Roman Catholic
bishop, Carlos Belo, who fled to Australia. There also are numerous
reports of churches being burned.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation of five representatives to the United Nations met
with President B.J. Habibie on Thursday and received a new promise
that Indonesia would act to curb the military-backed militias that
have been killing, burning and looting for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, Dili, now mostly a battered, smoldering ruin
emptied of most of its residents, the United Nations dug in to
maintain at least a small international staff if only to protect
some 2,000 refugees who have taken refuge in its compound. On
Wednesday it had been on the verge of leaving because of continuing
threats and dwindling supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason for the delay of the evacuation was that
there is a significant portion of the Ulited Nations staff who said
they would remain behind,'' said Jeffrey Robinson, a political
affairs officer in the mission.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plan now was to leave 40 to 50 officials in Dili to
provide protection for the refugees and maintain the U.N. presence
in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be a sign that some order was being restored,
Indonesian troops were reported Thursday to be helping to resupply
the besieged U.N. office, one day after armed men prevented its
trucks from driving to a warehouse for food and water.
</P>
<P>
   With military-backed militias destroying the territory's
communications system and forcing the departure of most journalists
and other outsiders, continuing reports of massacres and terror
were difficult to verify.
</P>
<P>
   As international pressure on Indonesia intensified, Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas admitted that the military command in Jakarta
had lost control of the situation in East Timor, a tiny territory
of 800,000 people that was invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The violence there intensified after the announcement on
Saturday that the East Timorese people had voted by nearly 80
percent, in a referendum on Aug. 30, for independence from
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military as an institution, the police as an institution,
are not in support of the people burning and killing and looting,''
Alatas said. ``These are criminal activities and we are going to
put a stop to it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new promise. Elements of the military and police
have openly aided and participated in the violence and in an
extraordinary campaign of forced migration that has driven some
200,000 people _ or one quarter of the population _ out of the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Alatas denied that people were being forced to leave, despite
the reports of relief organizations, the observations of witnesses
in Dili and the accounts of some of the displaced people
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He called these reports ``the greatest nonsense I have ever
heard'' and asserted: ``These people want to go to safer places and
we are helping them.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Some were being corralled in camps in the neighboring Indonesian
territory of West Timor where armed militias continued to keep them
under control and prevent foreigners from talking to them. Others
were being put aboard ferries and sent to distant islands.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the U.N. delegation met for two hours Thursday with
Habibie. They said he agreed to allow them to visit Dili on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expressed our concerns very strongly about the continuing
humanitarian problems and the bloodshed in East Timor,'' said one
member of the delegations.
</P>
<P>
   An official traveling with the U.N. mission described the
meeting with the president as a ``reality check.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear that Indonesia's perception of what is going on
in East Timor is quite different to the rest of the world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's public position is that reports from East Timor have
been exaggerated, that there is no organized campaign of killings
and arson and that no one is being forced to leave the territory.
</P>
<P>
   A smuggled videotape of Dili, filmed two days ago, showed a city
in ruins, its buildings smashed and scarred, its streets littered
with abandoned vehicles but empty of people, its marketplace in
ruins and its sky filled with dense smoke from burning buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But there were reports from Dili on Thursday that the crescendo
of violence there had ebbed.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting this view, the chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen.
Sudrajat, told reporters, ``There has been an improvement.
Generally the burning has stopped although clouds of smoke were
still seen rising from certain pockets. Hopefully within two or
three days all public facilities will resume as normal and by next
week the situation would be fully restored.''
</P>
<P>
   In another report of violence, East Timorese exiles said that
the militias had killed the 82-year-old father of Jose Alexandre
Gusmao, the pro-independence leader who was released from seven
years of detention just two days ago.

NOBEL WINNER REBUKES CANCER SOCIETY FOR WITHDRAWING SUPPORT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Calif.)   By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society is caught between a cardinal of the
Roman Catholic Church and a Nobel laureate over the society's
position on human embryonic stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the society, which receives $500 million a year in
public donations, withdrew from Patients' Cure, a consortium of
advocacy groups formed to lobby Congress not to ban federally
financed research on human embryonic stem cells. Biologists hope
the cells will help repair damaged tissues in a wide variety of
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite position is taken by the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, which objects to the fact that the stem cells are
derived from the surplus embryos created in fertility clinics. The
American Cancer Society withdrew from Patients' Cure after Cardinal
William Keeler of Baltimore wrote the society, urging it to
reconsider its position, and a Catholic group canceled pledges for
a cancer research fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The society said at the time that it withdrew because of a
policy disagreement with Patients' Cure, not because of pressure
from the church.
</P>
<P>
   But the society's position drew a stinging rebuke from Dr. Paul
Berg, who won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1980. He wrote of his
unhappiness to Dr. John Seffrin, chief executive officer of the
cancer society, in a letter dated Aug. 27, which has now become
public.
</P>
<P>
   Berg, a Stanford University biologist, led scientists in 1975 in
assessing another new research tool, the recombinant DNA technique,
which gave researchers unprecedented flexibility in transferring
genes from one organism to another.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that he had devoted his professional life to basic
research that might lead to cancer prevention, Berg said: ``One can
only contrast the Society's full and courageous support for
recombinant DNA research when that breakthrough occurred 25 years
ago with the present timid and equivocal stance it has taken with
regard to a potentially equally profound technology. Have politics
and ideology taken precedence over science at the ACS?''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the American Cancer Society released its response
to Berg, a letter in which Seffrin wrote that the society is now
developing its own position on stem cell research and ``must not be
manipulated into prematurely favoring any particular point of
view.''

KINGSBURY NAMED PRESIDENT OF FILENE'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Filene's senior vice president Thomas A. Kingsbury was
promoted Thursday to president of the Boston-based chain of 42
stores operated by May Department Stores Co. of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   At Filene's, the titles of chief executive and president have
traditionally been held by the same person. Since 1996, those two
titles have been held by Judith K. Hofer. Her predecessor, Gene
Kahn, also held both titles.
</P>
<P>
   Hofer arrived in Boston nearly four years ago, and it is widely
believed she is the first woman to run a large department store
chain in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Hofer will retain her title as Filene's chief executive officer,
and Kingsbury, 46, will now be president, said May, which also
operates such chains as Lord &AMP; Taylor, Hecht's, and Robinson-May.
J. Kent McHose continues as Filene's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hofer, a 30-year veteran with May, nor Kingsbury was
available for comment. A Wisconsin native, Kingsbury has spent 23
years with May in a variety of posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased to have someone of Tom's exceptional
background, talent, and dedication assuming the presidency of
Filene's,'' said Kahn, May's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very confident he will lead the division to continued
success and growth,'' Kahn added in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel changes might be interpreted as Kingsbury's being
groomed as Hofer's successor or as dissatisfaction with Filene's as
competition intensifies with archrival Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macy's has been doing very well in the Northeast,'' said John
Macht, a Boston retail consultant who counts Macy's as a client.
``Competition between the two continues to intensify.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Filene's spokeswoman strongly denied that performance
issues had anything to do with changes at Filene's.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the year, Filene's has been the top performer among
May's chains, said Filene's Robin Reibel, and Kingsbury's promotion
should be viewed in the context of several similar personnel moves
made in other May chains.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for dividing the titles of president and chief
executive at Filene's ``is to help manage the increasing
complexities of our business,'' Reibel said. ``This is a very
positive thing for our company.''
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1998, Filene's had sales of $1.6 billion; May reported
annual revenues of roughly $13.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   When Hofer arrived at Filene's in 1996 from another May
division, annual sales at Filene's were about $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Like many retailers, May has been enjoying the fruits of a
strong economy that has consumers spending freely.
</P>
<P>
   May's recent quarterly results were ``above expectations,''
noted Banc of America Securities analyst Thomas H. Tashjian in an
August report.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Walter F. Loeb of Loeb Associates said he doesn't
anticipate any changes resulting from Kingsbury's promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's steady as it goes,'' Loeb said. ``May is doing
very well.''

AFGHANISTAN PRODUCES 75 PERCENT OF WORLD'S OPIUM, U.N. REPORT
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Benefiting from a bumper harvest and wider cultivation,
Afghanistan more than doubled its production of opium in the past
year and now accounts for three-quarters of the world opium crop,
according to a U.N. report expected to be released in Vienna on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The jump in production, to an estimated 5,060 tons from 2,310
last year, has alarmed the executive director of the U.N. Office
for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, Pino Arlacchi. Arlacchi said
he had advised Secretary General Kofi Annan that Afghan opium
production was spinning out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a policy for Afghanistan,'' Arlacchi said this week in
a telephone interview from Moscow, where he has been discussing
drug control with Russia. ``We cannot stay and wait and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Afghanistan's record output could potentially flood
Western Europe, the primary market for heroin refined from Afghan
opium, with the rest spilling over to other regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy-five percent of the world's production is simply not
tolerable'' from Afghanistan, Arlacchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a customary 10-to-1 ratio for refining opium into
heroin, the jump in production could mean as much as 270 additional
tons of heroin on the world drug market in coming months, if the
estimate is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Afghan traffickers have been encountering added difficulties in
transporting opium after a smuggling crackdown by neighboring Iran.
Arlacchi said hundreds of tons of opium, and possibly some heroin,
were believed stockpiled in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Myanmar, which for years was believed to be the
leading opium producer, reaped an estimated 1,320 tons in the last
year, said the survey, conducted for the U.N. International Drug
Control Program in Vienna. Arlacchi said Myanmar, formerly Burma,
had reduced its output 8  &UR; percent  &LR; to 10 percent over the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller quantities of opium were reportedly grown in Colombia,
the source of most heroin that reaches New York City, and in Laos,
Thailand and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi said Afghanistan's emergence as the leading producer
confirmed a trend toward concentrating drug production in fewer
countries, a factor that could make the threat simpler to combat.
Colombia produces most of the world's cocaine and has increased its
cultivation of coca leaf, while Peru and Bolivia have curtailed
their plantings.
</P>
<P>
   The U &UR; .N.  &LR; survey reported opium poppy cultivation for the first
time in Jawzjan and Kunduz  &UR; p &LR; rovinces of northern Afghanistan,
meaning that opium is now grown in 18 of the 31 provinces.
Ninety-seven percent of the opium is cultivated in areas controlled
by the Taliban, the militant Islamic movement that dominates the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The production increase follows heavy rains, hailstorms and
earthquakes last year, problems that reduced the harvest by a
quarter and led to failures in parts of central and southern
Afghanistan. Farmers scrambled to make up losses by planting more
poppies and now have little incentive to scale back what has been a
43 percent increase in cultivation, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan's remote terrain, an absence of an effective central
government and continuing civil warfare and lawlessness have helped
opium thrive. The Taliban leadership has expressed disapproval of
opium as contrary to Islam, but tolerates its cultivation as a cash
crop and even levies an agricultural tax.
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi has contended that drug crops could be eradicated by
having farmers substitute legal crops in return for development
projects like schools, health clinics and roads. The new survey
reports that opium production in Afghanistan declined in the
Maiwand, Ghorak and Khakrez districts, where the United Nations has
introduced experimental programs in cooperation with local
officials.
</P>
<P>
   When Arlacchi visited Afghanistan in November 1997, he asked
Taliban leaders to crack down on opium production in return for
development aid, but said they had not followed through.
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi described Russian authorities as extremely worried that
profits generated by Afghan opium could be used by Islamic
militants to destabilize Tajikistan and other neighbors in Central
Asia. He said he planned to ask the United States and other U.N.
members to draft a strategy to block opium exports through the
countries that border Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   To compile its annual survey, the U.N. program employed Afghans
to travel through rural areas where opium cultivation had been
reported and to interview farmers and officials.
</P>
<P>
   The United States takes a similarly pessimistic view of
Afghanistan's expanding production. But its estimates, based on a
different methodology that involves satellite imagery, are more
conservative. The State Department reported in March that
Afghanistan produced 1,485 tons of opium in 1998, still ranking
first in the world. The State Department has not release its 1999
estimate.

   Frank McCourt's breathlessly anticipated ``'Tis,'' a memoir that
picks up where the best-selling ``Angela's Ashes'' left off, heads
an impressive list of nonfiction for the fall. And in fiction, Toni
Cade Bambara's ``Those Bones Are Not My Child,'' her posthumously
published novel based on the 1979-81 Atlanta child killings, surely

 &HT;    Minorities suffer disproportionately from cancer, CDC discuss
stats
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cancer continues to scar and kill America's minority
groups at a greater rate than whites, and the disparity won't
change with the standard remedy of a big federal bandage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the billions of federal dollars poured into
cancer research, participants called upon local communities to take
the lead in raising cancer awareness and overcoming barriers that
keep many minorities from getting early cancer screening and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous health experts hammered home that message this week and
at a national cancer conference spearheaded by the Atlanta-based
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know too many people who have cancer and they shouldn't have
cancer, too many people who have died of cancer and they shouldn't
have died - not in this country,'' said Susan Shinagawa of the
Intercultural Cancer Council, a group of health educators,
clinicians and researchers working to reduce cancer incidence and
mortality among minorities. ``The technological, pharmaceutical and
therapeutic advances now in place for cancer (are) not reaching all
of our communities, and we need to ask why?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite declining rates of cancer among whites, experts said
``an unequal burden of cancer'' continues among African-Americans,
Native Americans, Hispanics and other ethnic groups.
African-American women have a higher death rate from breast cancer
than any other racial or ethnic population; African-American men
have the highest death rate from prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty, geographic isolation, lower education and a host of
cultural factors, such as distrust of the medical profession and a
feeling of fatalism among some, all contribute to the disparity,
experts said. A lack of reliable cancer data on some minorities,
particularly Asian-Americans, and stereotypes are also factors,
said Shinagawa, 42, of San Diego. Her breast cancer might not have
been detected in 1991 had she not insisted on a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a doctor tell me, despite a lump on my breast, `I won't
even consider doing a biopsy,' '' Shinagawa said. ```You're too
young, you have no family history and Asian women don't get breast
cancer.'''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, attended by some 800 local and national health
specialists, educators and non-profit groups, focused on the need
for partnerships between national experts and local advocacy
groups.
</P>
<P>
   One example of such a partnership: In the rural community of
Eutaw, Ala., foundation grants provided training for local women to
organize breast cancer education seminars. Mammography screening
increased 18 percent the year after the seminars
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, officials turned to the African-American faith
community to help get the message out for breast and cervical
cancer education. Called The Witness Project, the effort also
brings cancer survivors to demonstrate cancer is not an automatic
death sentence.

than any other racial or ethnic population; African-American men
have the highest death rate from prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty, geographic isolation, lower education and a host of
cultural factors, such as distrust of the medical profession and a
feeling of fatalism among some, all contribute to the disparity,
experts said. A lack of reliable cancer data on some minorities,
particularly Asian-Americans, and stereotypes are also factors,
said Shinagawa, 42, of San Diego. Her breast cancer might not have
been detected in 1991 had she not insisted on a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a doctor tell me, despite a lump on my breast, `I won't
even consider doing a biopsy,' '' Shinagawa said. ```You're too
young, you have no family history and Asian women don't get breast
cancer.'''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, attended by some 800 local and national health
specialists, educators and non-profit groups, focused on the need
for partnerships between national experts and local advocacy
groups.
</P>
<P>
   One example of such a partnership: In the rural community of
Eutaw, Ala., foundation grants provided training for local women to
organize breast cancer education seminars. Mammography screening
increased 18 percent the year after the seminars
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, officials turned to the African-American faith
community to help get the message out for breast and cervical
cancer education. Called The Witness Project, the effort also
brings cancer survivors to demonstrate cancer is not an automatic
death sentence.

<P>
   Catfish Hunter, the Hall of Fame right-hander who helped pitch
the Oakland A's and the New York Yankees to six pennants in the
1970s, hurled a perfect game and was part of an economic revolution
in sports, died Thursday at his home at Hertford, N.C. He was 53.
</P>
<P>
   He had been struggling for the last year with amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, the progressive and ultimately fatal
neurological condition known as Lou Gehrig's disease. He had also
been hospitalized after falling and hitting his head on concrete
steps outside his home Aug. 8. He was sent home last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was a premier pitcher of his era, a 6-foot, 190-pounder
who did not have overpowering speed but possessed outstanding
control, an assortment of superb pitches and a winner's poise.
</P>
<P>
   He won 224 games in 15 major-league seasons from 1965 to 1979
and won at least 21 games over five consecutive seasons, from 1971
to 1974 with Oakland and in 1975 with the Yankees. He won the Cy
Young Award as the American League's top pitcher in 1974 and was an
eight-time All-Star. In compiling a record of 224-166, he had an
outstanding career earned run average of 3.26.
</P>
<P>
   Although an unassuming ballplayer who rarely took himself
seriously, Hunter was wise enough to become the first big-money
free agent. An arbitrator freed him from his contract with Charlie
Finley's Athletics after the 1974 season, and the Yankees signed
him to a five-year, $3.35 million contract that was the largest in
baseball history at that time. While his case did not directly lead
to free agency for other players _ a ruling in an unrelated case
the next year led to that _ it showed the players what they, too,
might command from the baseball owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He paved the way for me,'' said Roger Clemens, who will earn
$16.1 million with the Yankees over 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   James Augustus Hunter was born on April 8, 1946, on a farm near
Hertford in Perquimans County. He said he was taught to pitch by
his older brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My three brothers taught me to throw strikes,'' he said when
inducted into the baseball Hall of Fame in 1987, ``and thanks to
them I gave up 379 home runs in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was overstating things a bit, having given up 374 homers.
And the control he developed by throwing baseballs at a hole in the
barn door _ the last brother to hit the hole had to do the chores _
would pay off.
</P>
<P>
   A Yankee teammate, pitcher Pat Dobson, once said about Hunter:
``He can put the ball where he wants it _ or within an inch or two,
which is just about as good. From that one capacity stems
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, Hunter's family would travel to Baltimore to watch
major-league baseball. ``I remember once we were watching Robin
Roberts there,'' Hunter said, ``and my father said, `Hell, I could
hit him; he's not throwing that hard.' We were sitting behind the
plate, and Roberts really did look as though you could murder him.
But nobody seemed to do it. I admired the heck out of Roberts. I
just naturally patterned myself after him, and eventually I learned
to do it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Major-league hitters would feel the same way about Hunter as
Hunter's father had felt about Roberts. ``I could never understand
why I couldn't hit Hunter,'' said Ed Herrmann, an opponent who
later became a teammate on the Yankees. ``Even when you're up at
the plate, you think, just give me one more of those and I'll clout
it out of here. But I rarely did.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was known all his life as Jimmy in his home area. Finley,
the A's flamboyant owner, gave him the nickname Catfish and
apparently manufactured a story to go with it. ``Around here, we
never call him Catfish,'' Ray Ward, editor of The Perquimans
Weekly, had said. ``We call him Jimmy. Jimmy's mother has been
upset about the nickname.'' The story created to go with the name:
that Hunter had once run away from home and come back with two
catfish. ``His mother was irritated that somebody would believe her
little boy ran off,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   During Hunter's senior year at Perquimans High School in
Hertford, he was wounded in his right foot when his brother Pete's
shotgun misfired, destroying the little toe and leaving the foot
full of pellets. The Kansas City Athletics signed him anyway, for a
$50,000 bonus, and sent him to the Mayo Clinic for surgery. He
spent the 1964 season on the disabled list, but the foot did not
bother him after the operation even though about 15 shotgun pellets
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter never pitched in the minor leagues, starting the 1965
season with a cellar-bound Kansas City team that had eight rookies.
He had an 8-8 record that year and was 55-64 in his first five
seasons, never finishing above .500. Despite his mediocre won-lost
records with mostly mediocre teams, Hunter was named an American
League All-Star in 1966 and 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 Finley moved the A's to Oakland, and on May 8 of that
year Hunter retired all 27 Minnesota Twins he faced, the first
regular-season perfect game in the American League since 1922.
</P>
<P>
   The A's fortunes improved dramatically after their move to
Oakland, and they quickly developed into a powerhouse that won
three straight World Series from 1972-74. Hunter also improved, and
he became the steady center of a swaggering, squabbling club that
featured larger-than-life characters like Reggie Jackson, Vida Blue
and Rollie Fingers. In his last five seasons with Oakland he
compiled a record of 106-49, and he was 4-0 in seven World Series
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a teammate of Hunter's with both the A's and the
Yankees, would recall, ``When we started winning in Oakland, Cat
was the father of those teams.'' Hunter was only 26 when the A's
won their first World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing about Cat is that statistics didn't mean much
to him,'' said Lou Piniella, a teammate on the Yankees. ``The only
thing that mattered was victories. He didn't have overpowering
stuff, but he knew how to pitch and how to beat you. If there as a
game you had to win, he's the guy you wanted on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   After he won the Cy Young Award in 1974 with a record of 25-12
and a league-leading 2.49 ERA., Hunter uncovered a violation of his
contract with Finley and the A's that allowed him to become a free
agent. The A's were to send half of Hunter's $100,000 annual salary
to a North Carolina bank as payment on an annuity, but Finley did
not comply.

 UNDATED: not comply.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At season's end, with the guidance of the players' association,
Hunter took a grievance to arbitration. He won and was declared a
free agent, unfamiliar words in baseball in 1974. When he learned
of it by telephone, Hunter hung up and, shaken, turned to his wife,
Helen. ``We don't belong to anybody,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' Hunter recalled. ``I didn't have a job. I
didn't realize the implications.''
</P>
<P>
   His case was an anomaly; it was the next year before Andy
Messersmith and Dave McNally would challenge baseball's reserve
clause and win, establishing the players union's power and spurring
a tremendous escalation in athletes' salaries. But Hunter was about
to show baseball players what their services were worth on the open
market.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was the most accomplished veteran player ever to become a
free agent, and soon teams were clamoring for his services in an
unprecedented bidding war. Among those who sought to sign him was
Gene Autry, the singing cowboy of the movies who was the owner of
the California Angels. Autry was so eager that he traveled across
the country to meet Hunter in Ahoskie, N.C., 60 miles from
Hertford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene Autry came down here handing out records of `Rudolph the
Red-Nosed Reindeer,''' Hunter once recalled. ``That was the biggest
thing that ever came to Ahoskie.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three of the 24 teams in the major leagues _ all but the
San Francisco Giants _ bid for Hunter's services. George
Steinbrenner's $3.35 million offer to pitch for the Yankees for
five years, which included a $1 million signing bonus and various
insurance policies and annuities, was the most appealing, and the
Yankees announced the signing of Hunter on New Year's Eve 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the financial package were $25,000 payments for
annuities for college tuition for his two children, Todd, then 5,
and Kimberly, 2. His son Paul was born five years later. ``I forgot
I might have one more after baseball,'' Hunter said. ``I have to
pay for him myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The $150,000 annual salary Hunter received from the Yankees did
not even rank among the top 10 in baseball _ Dick Allen of the
Chicago White Sox had received $250,000 in 1974. But the total
package was the largest in baseball's history, and it made Hunter,
at age 28, one of the three or four highest-paid American athletes
at a time when rival leagues in hockey and football had already
begun to drive up salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not just the money that brought Hunter to New York.
``We'd had better offers, but New York was closer to home and they
played on regular grass,'' he said. Coming to the Yankees also
meant rejoining Clyde Kluttz, the scout who had signed Hunter to
his first contract with Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter again led the league in victories in his first season
with the Yankees, winning 23 games. He was 17-15 the following
season, when the team won its first pennant in 12 years, and he
compiled records of 9-9 and 12-6 for the Yankees' World
Series-winning teams of 1977 and 1978, despite spending time on the
disabled list during both seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He was a humorous and stabilizing force in the clubhouse for the
Yankees, as he had been for the A's. While his jokes to teammates
could be pointed, they were usually taken well. When Jackson had a
candy bar named for him, Hunter said, ``When you unwrap one, it
tells you how good it is.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hunter was elected to the Hall of Fame, Steinbrenner, the
Yankees' principal owner, said: ``You started our success. You were
the first to teach us how to win. Other Yankees continued that
leadership role, but you were the one who first showed us what it
means to be a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter retired from baseball at age 33 when his contract expired
after the 1979 season, having suffered problems with his pitching
arm. But he found it no hardship to leave the limelight and return
to his roots. Shortly after he joined the Yankees he had said: ``I
don't like New York much, either. I had to live in a hotel downtown
for a couple of months until my wife got here. Hated it. Now I got
this nice home in Norwood, N.J., and I just drive straight from
there to the ball park. Never go downtown. Nothing for me to do
down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter and his wife, Helen, his high school sweetheart, lived in
the same house outside tiny Hertford for more than 20 years. But
their 100 acres had increased to 1,000. He was a full-time farmer
in his corn, soybean and peanut fields for 10 years after he
retired from baseball, and then he turned it over to a friend who
leased the land.
</P>
<P>
   He was an avid fisherman and hunter, keeping a kennel of deer
hounds and bird dogs and shooting quail, pheasant, rabbit and deer
in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and three children, Hunter is survived
by three brothers, three sisters and a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was a fierce competitor, but he kept his perspective and
his unruffled disposition, understanding that baseball was just a
game. ``Golf's the only thing that makes me mad,'' he once said,
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter entered a hospital in Baltimore in September 1998 after
experiencing difficulties with motor skills, and ALS was diagnosed.
He did not appear in public outside his hometown again until March,
when he attended the Yankees' first spring training game in Tampa,
Fla. He joked with reporters but had difficulty shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no strength in my arms and my hands,'' he had said
last fall. ``I can't do the routine things like button a shirt
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen helped him with cutting his food and tying his shoes.
``I'm putting a lot of work on her and she's strong,'' Hunter said.
``But once in a while we sit here and cry together.''

   Catfish Hunter, the Hall of Fame right-hander who helped pitch
the Oakland A's and the New York Yankees to six pennants in the
1970s, hurled a perfect game and was part of an economic revolution

free agent, and soon teams were clamoring for his services in an
unprecedented bidding war. Among those who sought to sign him was
Gene Autry, the singing cowboy of the movies who was the owner of
the California Angels. Autry was so eager that he traveled across
the country to meet Hunter in Ahoskie, N.C., 60 miles from
Hertford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene Autry came down here handing out records of `Rudolph the
Red-Nosed Reindeer,''' Hunter once recalled. ``That was the biggest
thing that ever came to Ahoskie.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three of the 24 teams in the major leagues _ all but the
San Francisco Giants _ bid for Hunter's services. George
Steinbrenner's $3.35 million offer to pitch for the Yankees for
five years, which included a $1 million signing bonus and various
insurance policies and annuities, was the most appealing, and the
Yankees announced the signing of Hunter on New Year's Eve 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the financial package were $25,000 payments for
annuities for college tuition for his two children, Todd, then 5,
and Kimberly, 2. His son Paul was born five years later. ``I forgot
I might have one more after baseball,'' Hunter said. ``I have to
pay for him myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The $150,000 annual salary Hunter received from the Yankees did
not even rank among the top 10 in baseball _ Dick Allen of the
Chicago White Sox had received $250,000 in 1974. But the total
package was the largest in baseball's history, and it made Hunter,
at age 28, one of the three or four highest-paid American athletes
at a time when rival leagues in hockey and football had already
begun to drive up salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not just the money that brought Hunter to New York.
``We'd had better offers, but New York was closer to home and they
played on regular grass,'' he said. Coming to the Yankees also
meant rejoining Clyde Kluttz, the scout who had signed Hunter to
his first contract with Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter again led the league in victories in his first season
with the Yankees, winning 23 games. He was 17-15 the following
season, when the team won its first pennant in 12 years, and he
compiled records of 9-9 and 12-6 for the Yankees' World
Series-winning teams of 1977 and 1978, despite spending time on the
disabled list during both seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He was a humorous and stabilizing force in the clubhouse for the
Yankees, as he had been for the A's. While his jokes to teammates
could be pointed, they were usually taken well. When Jackson had a
candy bar named for him, Hunter said, ``When you unwrap one, it
tells you how good it is.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hunter was elected to the Hall of Fame, Steinbrenner, the
Yankees' principal owner, said: ``You started our success. You were
the first to teach us how to win. Other Yankees continued that
leadership role, but you were the one who first showed us what it
means to be a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter retired from baseball at age 33 when his contract expired
after the 1979 season, having suffered problems with his pitching
arm. But he found it no hardship to leave the limelight and return
to his roots. Shortly after he joined the Yankees he had said: ``I
don't like New York much, either. I had to live in a hotel downtown
for a couple of months until my wife got here. Hated it. Now I got
this nice home in Norwood, N.J., and I just drive straight from
there to the ball park. Never go downtown. Nothing for me to do
down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter and his wife, Helen, his high school sweetheart, lived in
the same house outside tiny Hertford for more than 20 years. But
their 100 acres had increased to 1,000. He was a full-time farmer
in his corn, soybean and peanut fields for 10 years after he
retired from baseball, and then he turned it over to a friend who
leased the land.
</P>
<P>
   He was an avid fisherman and hunter, keeping a kennel of deer
hounds and bird dogs and shooting quail, pheasant, rabbit and deer
in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and three children, Hunter is survived
by three brothers, three sisters and a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was a fierce competitor, but he kept his perspective and
his unruffled disposition, understanding that baseball was just a
game. ``Golf's the only thing that makes me mad,'' he once said,
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter entered a hospital in Baltimore in September 1998 after
experiencing difficulties with motor skills, and ALS was diagnosed.
He did not appear in public outside his hometown again until March,
when he attended the Yankees' first spring training game in Tampa,
Fla. He joked with reporters but had difficulty shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no strength in my arms and my hands,'' he had said
last fall. ``I can't do the routine things like button a shirt
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen helped him with cutting his food and tying his shoes.
``I'm putting a lot of work on her and she's strong,'' Hunter said.
``But once in a while we sit here and cry together.''

MISSION TO HUBBLE MOVES AHEAD OF MAPPING FLIGHT 
 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ NASA said Thursday it plans to swap the order of the
two shuttle missions that remain this year, placing a trip to the
Hubble Space Telescope ahead of an Earth-mapping flight.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle launches have been suspended since the late July flight
of Columbia with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The space agency
ordered repairs to dozens of miles of electrical wiring in
Endeavour, which had been scheduled for a mid-September liftoff;
Discovery, which been targeted for a mid-October flight; and
Atlantis, which was scheduled for an early December trip.
</P>
<P>
   With work this week running 70 percent complete on Discovery and
60 percent complete on Endeavour, the space agency elected Thursday
to flip the order of the flights and establish tentative launch
dates.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery will lift off no earlier than Oct. 28 with a crew of
seven for a 10-day mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. The
orbiting observatory's pointing control system is in need of new
gyroscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour and a crew of six will launch no sooner than Nov. 19
on an 11-day flight with a radar apparatus designed to produce a
three-dimensional map of the Earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   The dates are considered targets and could change as the repair
efforts are reassessed next week.
</P>
<P>
   Also driving flight plans is the annual late November Leonid
meteor shower. For the last several years, the space agency has
observed a hiatus in shuttle missions during the most intense
period of the shower, around Nov. 18, when there is an increased
risk of collision.

DENVER PROGRAM WOULD LINK TEACHERS' RAISES TO STUDENTS'
ACHIEVEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ In what would be the nation's most far-reaching plan to
make teachers accountable for their students' academic progress,
members of the Denver teachers union are expected on Friday to
approve a pilot program that would link raises to their students'
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Other districts reward teachers for meeting goals set at the
start of the school year, and some, including Columbus, Ohio, pay
teachers bonuses for student achievement. But if the two-year
Denver pilot plan leads to a permanent system, traditional criteria
for annual raises, like years of service and cost-of-living
allowances, would be scrapped for salary increases based solely on
classroom results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay-for-performance based on student outcome is totally
unheard of,'' said Andrea Giunta, president of the Denver Classroom
Teachers Association. ``No one has ever done it. But we think this
is a reasonable program, so we decided, `Let's test it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed experiment in Denver, a city that, like others, has
struggled to improve student achievement, especially among students
from poor and minority families, comes as an increasing number of
school systems around the country are turning to assessment tests
and other standards to determine whether students will be held back
a grade or sent to tutoring sessions beyond the regular school day.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has gained such currency that the leading candidates
in next year's presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore and
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, have made raised educational
standards and teacher accountability a cornerstone of their
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere else in the country has a school district moved so
close as Denver to tying teacher salaries directly to results
achieved in the classroom. At the end of the proposed pilot
program, school officials here would evaluate the results and
recommend criteria on which to base pay increases. The teachers
union would then vote for what would become a permanent system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merit programs in the past have not worked because they have
been based on false premises and they have been evaluated in uneven
ways,'' said Robert F. Chase, president of the National Education
Association, the nation's largest teachers union. ``But proposals
like the one in Denver are taking merit pay into a different
direction, and we're seeing folks around the country who are
willing to look at new programs and say, `Let's take a look at it
and see what it means.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jewell Gould, director of research for the American Federation
of Teachers, the second-largest teachers union, said: ``Denver is
clearly breaking new ground with this system. It's also one of the
better proposals I've seen on merit pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The test program is expected to be approved by Denver's 4,300
public school teachers, partly because for two years it would
supplement current pay schedules for the 450 teachers who
participate. Teachers in Denver's public schools now earn annual
salaries from $24,000 for first-year teachers to $56,200 for a
41-year veteran. Teachers in the pilot program can make as much as
$1,500 a year more.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan is approved, school administrators intend to select
three groups of five schools _ four elementary schools and one
middle school _ to put the plan into effect. In the second year the
school district plans to add a high school to each of the three
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Each teacher in the pilot schools would receive $500 for
participating and an additional $1,000 if, by the end of the
academic year, a majority of the teacher's students showed an
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Each group of participating schools would be evaluated for
student improvement by a different indicator. One group would
measure scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. One would measure
tests and classroom work given by the teacher. The third would
measure student improvement in classrooms where teachers have
sought to increase their teaching skills by taking a development
course.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the trial period, a panel of two officials from
the school system and two from the teachers union would evaluate
the results and recommend achievement criteria for a permanent
system on which pay increases would be based, replacing the current
system that essentially rewards teachers just for returning each
fall.
</P>
<P>
   School district officials said the pilot program would cost
about $3 million, increasing the overall level of raises for the
two-year period to about $8 million. Amy Hudson, a spokeswoman for
the school district, said the money would be offset by cuts
``outside of the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teachers said Thursday that voting for a permanent plan
based on student improvement would be much harder than approving a
two-year test program that has no financial downside.
</P>
<P>
   They also expressed concern over how their students would be
evaluated to measure success and how pressures to spur classroom
improvement might have adverse effects on them _ issues that school
district officials conceded would not be known until the permanent
system was devised.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Tisdell, a teacher for 29 years _ the last 19 at Newlon
Elementary School, where she teaches the fifth grade _ said that
teachers typically set performance goals for the year anyway and
that putting a price tag on them might generate competition among
teachers who generally work together to seek common solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that would be good for morale for teachers,'' Ms.
Tisdell said.
</P>
<P>
   And what if the criteria used to measure improvement do not
match a teacher's academic plan?
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Garcia-Pettit, who teaches English to Spanish-speaking
children in the third and fourth grades at Newlon, said that even
the most objective of the three standards in the pilot program, the
Iowa tests, which are administered in English, might not be suited
to the children she teaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, there's a question about crop rotation,'' Ms.
Garcia-Pettit said. ``This is an urban school _ we don't teach crop
rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go along with pay-for-performance,'' she said of the
pilot program. ``You'd be crazy not to. But I'm a little leery of
the future. I want it all spelled out. I'd want to know exactly
what they're talking about. Right now, I just don't know.''

YEN GETS A BOOST FROM BY REPORTS OF GROWTH IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The yen jumped to a three-year high against the dollar
on international markets on Friday after the Japanese government
surprised analysts with a report indicating that the economy grew
from April to June, expanding for two successive quarters for the
first time in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Economic Planning Agency announced on Thursday that the
economy grew by 0.2 percent _ an annualized rate of 0.9 percent _
in the April-June quarter, beating consensus projections of a
marginal decline.
</P>
<P>
   The new economic figures, which measure the total value of goods
and services produced in Japan, come as a seeming confirmation of
the unusually strong 2 percent growth _ an annualized rate of 8.1
percent _ in the previous quarter. The earlier numbers stunned
economists, some of whom even questioned the validity of the
figures.
</P>
<P>
   They also come as a welcome boost to Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, who on Thursday began his re-election campaign for the
presidency of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and who faces a
critical Lower House parliamentary election within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi responded to the gross domestic product announcement by
reiterating his government's projection of half a percent growth
this year. ``We have to make efforts by invoking all measures so
that Japan may maintain the momentum toward stable economic
growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese markets responded favorably to the new growth figures.
The benchmark Nikkei stock index also rose 36.18 points to close at
17,677.56 on Thursday. The yen hit 108.85 to the dollar in Tokyo,
and continued to strengthen overseas after the close of trading
here, hitting 107.78 in New York, passing a level last seen in
August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But if the narrowly positive growth rates of this quarter
suggested that the Japanese economy was finally stabilizing after a
decade-long recession characterized by a domestic debt crisis,
plummeting real estate prices and high _ by Japanese standards _
unemployment, analysts picking over the latest numbers remained
deeply divided over the country's economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The government itself, anxious not to prematurely ease its
policy of fiscal stimulus aimed at restoring growth as it has done
before, signaled moves on Thursday to quickly release new spending,
approved in a supplemental budget passed earlier this year. A
second, similarly large stimulative budget is expected before
year's end, economic analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan's economy is in a run-up to recovery, but it is not yet
on a full recovery track,'' said Taichi Sakaiya, the head of the
Economic Planning Agency, which releases the growth numbers each
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The additional spending measures come as personal consumption,
widely considered the key indicator of the country's recovery, grew
by a modest eight-tenths of a percent. Much of this came from a
record 16.1 percent jump in housing investment, as home-buyers
appeared to take advantage of special tax cuts and falling prices.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few other true bright spots in household spending was
on personal computers, which consumers have begun to buy
enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Figures released just Tuesday, meanwhile, showed a marked
decline in capital spending by Japanese corporations. Until demand
in these two sectors perk up, the government will feel obliged to
pick up the slack, hoping to avoid a relapse of recession.
</P>
<P>
   Despite agreement on these fundamentals, foreign economists were
deeply divided on the longer-term interpretation of the
consequences of the latest gross domestic product report's details.
While some said the numbers reflected a growing confidence in the
economy that would build new strength going forward, others warned
that persistent high unemployment and falling monthly wage figures
could spell more trouble just ahead. More and more, the pessimists
say, the government appears reliant on pump priming and lacks an
exit strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is very straightforward,'' said Jesper Koll,
chief economist at Merrill Lynch Japan. ``The policy measures
adopted by Obuchi last year have kicked in and are working.
Essentially today's numbers say that we have entered a period of
stability in which fiscal support goes hand in hand with
restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Koll dismissed worries about Japan's debt, and cited the fusion
of three of the country's largest banks last month as a sign that
after years of doldrums the corporate business sector had recovered
its vigor. ``A year ago bank managers could think of nothing but
sidling up to the public trough to seek money. Now they are making
deals and seizing the initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Other economists sounded much darker notes, however, with many
of them focusing on the consequences of continued government
spending as a solution to the crisis. Several economists described
the smart rise in housing starts and personal computer sales as
possible blips on the screen, and warned that at some point, Japan
will face a bill for all of the recent spending, much of it in the
form of costly bailouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer confidence is up, and the Obuchi government deserves
credit for that, but the question is what are the consequences of
the measures they've used to reach this goal,'' said Robert
Feldman, chief economist for Japan at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
``They've spent a lot of money on credit guarantees. In November
they added 20 trillion yen to the guarantee authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankruptcies are way down, of course, but the taxpayers are
holding the bag, and one has to wonder how much of this debt will
ever be repaid?''

CLINTON CUTS MILITARY TIES TO INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN AND JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton severed military cooperation
Thursday with Indonesia, and warned that Jakarta faced economic
ruin if it did not rein in the savage revenge campaign unleashed by
the losers of a landslide vote for independence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Indonesia does not end the violence, it must invite _ it
must invite _ the international community to assist in restoring
security,'' Clinton said in Washington, hours before he left for a
regional summit in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a pity if the Indonesian recovery were crashed by
this,'' Clinton said in breaking his long silence, which had been
assailed in Congress and overseas. ``But one way or the other, it
will be crashed by this if they don't fix it. . . . Nobody is going
to want to continue to invest there if they're allowing this sort
of travesty to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia stood firm against pressure to allow foreign
peacekeepers into the violence-wracked territory.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting for the first time that ``rogue elements'' of
the military may be involved in the violence, Jakarta insisted that
its 26,000-member force in East Timor can maintain order until
Indonesia's National Assembly considers approving the territory's
vote for independence. This is most likely to happen in November.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis over East Timor, an impoverished region of farmland
the size of Connecticut that Indonesia invaded in 1975, appeared to
be mutating into a domestic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Apparent complicity of the armed forces in the brutal backlash
also underlined that some in Jakarta have no intention of
respecting East Timor's vote for independence. It also suggested
that Indonesia's first civilian president in 32 years may not have
power over his military.
</P>
<P>
   President B.J. Habibie's aides denied persistent reports
Thursday that he was resigning or that he had fled the country. And
the armed forces chief, General Wiranto, dismissed rumors of a
coup.
</P>
<P>
   But Habibie, who replaced longtime military strongman General
Suharto last year, appeared weakened by the bloody aftermath of his
controversial decision in January to offer East Timor autonomy
under Indonesian rule or independence.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie hopes to be re-named president by the new national
assembly when it convenes later this fall. But his failure to halt
rampages possibly orchestrated by the army does not convey the
reassuring image of a strong leader.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, meanwhile, is capitalizing on the crisis, with
presidential hopeful Megawati Sukarnoputri blaming Habibie for the
violence and touring refugee camps Thursday. Likewise,
anti-government students have exploited the opportunity to protest
against military excesses.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the credibility not just of Habibie, but of
Indonesia itself.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Clinton's comments, Admiral Dennis Blair, commander
of the US Pacific Command, carried a message to Wiranto that the
crisis is imperiling Jakarta's foreign relations. After a 40-minute
meeting with Wiranto, Washington suspended all military contacts
with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis hit Jakarta's stock market and its currency Thursday.
The rupiah fell as low as 9,000 to the dollar, down 15.5 percent in
three days. The dip stoked fears of an economic meltdown like that
which saw the currency fall 80 percent last year, setting off
nationwide protests.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer Thursday compared
Dili, East Timor's capital, to Phnom Penh in 1975, when the Khmer
Rouge marched into Cambodia's capital and forced everyone into the
countryside and torture camps. ``Buildings are burning and there
are troops around and there are militia still running around _ but
there are no local people,'' Downer said.
</P>
<P>
   UN workers holed up in a beseiged Dili compound refused to
vacate their posts Wednesday despite orders to withdraw, because
they feared some 2,000 refugees sheltering at the compound would be
massacred. Believing the UN was leaving, however, most of the
refugees fled to the hills Wednesday night. About 50 foreign UN
staff will remain in place, while more than 300 international and
local hires are to be airlifted out Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas acknowledged
that ``rogue elements'' in the security forces may have been
involved in the violence. But he insisted that ``the military as an
institution, the police as an institution, are not in support of
the people burning and killing and looting.''
</P>
<P>
   Alatas refused to consider peacekeepers, saying Jakarta could
solve the problem itself. Asked how, he replied: ``We will shoot
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Taur Matan Ruak, commander of the pro-independence Falintil
guerrillas, told Portugal's TSF radio. ``not to believe in
Indonesian propaganda.'' If ``they say the situation in Dili is
diminishing in intensity, that is because there is no one left to
kill and to drive out.'' Falintil says it has heeded orders from
resistance leaders Xanana Gusmao not to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   The UN estimates that between 150,000 and 200,000 East Timorese
_ nearly one-fourth of the population _ has been displaced by the
violence. More than 100 people are reported dead this week, and
witnesses have described thousands of people being rounded up and
marched off at gunpoint to unknown destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came only after days of intense pressure in
Congress and by human rights groups for him to act. Rep. Barney
Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, said: ``There's been a great
explosion of people here upset with the administration's policy.
The response for the last couple of days has just been rotten. It's
almost inviting the Indonesians to go kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said he believed the outcry in Congress was due to
``sensitivity heightened by Kosovo, and people feeling that our
humanitarian policy shouldn't be only to help white people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Indonesia analysts believe the violence reveals a split in
Jakarta's military, or perhaps a unified conspiracy to overturn the
vote for independence and squelch separatist movements elsewhere in
the 13,000-island archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military...tell the public that they are the ones who keep
Indonesia united, so if East Timor is independent, their ideology
is broken,'' said Hendardi, head of the Indonesian Legal Aid and
Human Rights Association, the group that defended resistance leader
Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao, who was released Tuesday after serving six years of a
20-year sentence for fighting Indonesian rule, learned Thursday
that his father had been killed this week by pro-Indonesia gunmen,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Helio Tavares of the National Council of Timorese Resistance
spoke of a belief that subversive elements of the military ``want
to discredit the government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the international community imposes economic sanctions,''
he said in a telephone interview from Jakarta, ``they can say,
`See, this is an ineffective government. We were better off under
military rule.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A German-trained engineer, Habibie is notoriously unpopular with
the armed forces, and many officers who made their careers in East
Timor were furious that he unexpectedly opened the door for its
independence this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wiranto is either running'' the campaign of violence ``or he
is not innocent either,'' said a Jakarta-based diplomat. The
military may ``want to make Habibie look like a fool and provide a
stepping stone for someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Another diplomat said that after seeing heavily-armed men and
apparent army mutineers unleash what he called a scorched earth and
forced resettlement campaign this week, ``I have trouble believing
it's `rogue elements' of the military, considering how
well-organized this seems to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he dismissed rumors of a military coup in Jakarta,
saying: ``Why do you need a coup if the power relationship between
the military and the president is such that the military gets
exactly what it wants anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the crisis seems to be fueling greater worries in
Jakarta over the possibility of foreign peacekeepers than over the
possible cutoff of foreign aid or global condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia is reliant on a $43 billion bailout, and even before
Clinton's angry warning about economic consequences, the World Bank
said that aid could be contingent on Jakarta's ability to halt the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   But Dewi Fortuna Anwar, Habibie's chief foreign policy advisor,
told a television interviewer that repeated demands for foreign
peacekeepers serve only to ``produce ultra-nationalist backlash.''
Indonesia, she said, ``may say, `Go to hell with your Western aid.
We don't need it.' ''

CURTIS MARTIN: FOR PATRIOTS, AN OLD FRIEND IS A NOW A THREATENING
FOE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Fittingly, the first piece of bulletin board
material in the New England Patriots' locker room for the coming
season is an article about the possibility of Curtis Martin gaining
2,000 yards this season with the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, once the star running back in the Patriots' backfield,
defected to the Jets through free agency after the 1997 season. He
will begin his 2,000-yard quest against the Patriots in the
regular-season opener at Giants Stadium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the article about Martin is a doubly painful shot to
the Patriots. Not only is there the factor of what if he were still
with New England, but this season the Patriots do not have a
running back who can match Martin's skills.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Edwards, a brilliant first-round pick out of Georgia who
rushed for 1,115 yards last season, tore up his knee playing touch
football on a beach in Hawaii the week of the Pro Bowl game in
February. The injury is career-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Patriots head into the season opener against
the Jets with Kevin Faulk, a 5-foot-8-inch, 197-pound rookie who
was taken in the second round of this year's draft out of Louisiana
State University.
</P>
<P>
   The backup is Terry Allen, who was cut by the Washington
Redskins on June 1. The Patriots signed the 31-year-old Allen to a
two-year contract two weeks ago. Ankle injuries limited him to 20
games in the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   There are also questions as to whether Faulk, because of his
size, can withstand the rigors of 25 carries a game in the National
Football League. He was durable in college, where he missed only
two games in his career _ both in his junior season _ with
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots coach Pete Carroll said he expects Allen to play ``a
good bit'' against the Jets, but it will depend on how much of the
system Allen has picked up. So the bulk of the work will go to
Faulk, whom coaches have praised as being ahead of Edwards at this
point in their respective rookie seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, who is a shifty, quick-footed runner, said that his
greatest asset to this point is that he has come in and quickly
adapted to the Patriots' offensive system. He led the Patriots in
rushing in the preseason with 36 carries for 116 yards. And what
does he expect to do in his NFL debut?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get into the flow of the game,'' Faulk said.
``We have to try to set a tempo in the first series and go from
there. Whatever we have to do to win the game, that's what we'll
do. I don't know if I'll carry it five times or 10 times or 20
times. It doesn't matter to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the greatest backfield situation to have heading into
the season, but the Patriots do not have a lot of options. They do
plan to run the ball against the Jets and hope that it will be
enough to keep New York's defense from trying to stampede
quarterback Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe has the capability to carve up the Jets through the air,
but that will only work if New England can sell its running game.
</P>
<P>
   Tackle Bruce Armstrong said the Patriots' running back situation
reminds him of last season, when the team had to adjust to Martin's
departure. The Patriots found a quick solution in Edwards. He
wonders whether Faulk might be an instant remedy, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little guy has proven himself well,'' Armstrong said.
``He's adapted well in the preseason. He's a willing blocker and he
has shown flashes. But there's nothing like the real deal. When the
bullets start to fly that's when you know what you've got.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have a new, more aggressive blocking scheme that
they have worked on in training camp under the new offensive line
coach, Dante Scarnecchia.
</P>
<P>
   Scarnecchia, who has spent 17 years with New England, coached
the Patriots' special teams last season and shifted over to the
tackles and the guards this season.
</P>
<P>
   New England also has a new center, Damien Woody, the team's
first- round pick out of Boston College. So things could get a
little harried on Sunday, when Armstrong expects a hostile crowd to
make life miserable for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong thinks his team will be able run the ball against the
Jets, but he believes the coaches will have to display some
fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is for us not to panic no matter what they
do,'' he said. ``We have to be able to stick with the game plan
that we've worked on. If they stop us on the first or second series
we can't abandon the game plan.''

HALL OF FAME PITCHER CATFISH HUNTER DIES AT 53

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Catfish Hunter, the Hall of Fame right-hander who helped pitch
the Oakland A's and the New York Yankees to six pennants in the
1970s, hurled a perfect game and was part of an economic revolution
in sports, died Thursday at his home at Hertford, N.C. He was 53.
</P>
<P>
   He had been struggling for the last year with amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, the progressive and ultimately fatal
neurological condition known as Lou Gehrig's disease. He had also
been hospitalized after falling and hitting his head on concrete
steps outside his home Aug. 8. He was sent home last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was a premier pitcher of his era, a 6-foot, 190-pounder
who did not have overpowering speed but possessed outstanding
control, an assortment of superb pitches and a winner's poise.
</P>
<P>
   He won 224 games in 15 major-league seasons from 1965 to 1979
and won at least 21 games over five consecutive seasons, from 1971
to 1974 with Oakland and in 1975 with the Yankees. He won the Cy
Young Award as the American League's top pitcher in 1974 and was an
eight-time All-Star. In compiling a record of 224-166, he had an
outstanding career earned run average of 3.26.
</P>
<P>
   Although an unassuming ballplayer who rarely took himself
seriously, Hunter was wise enough to become the first big-money
free agent. An arbitrator freed him from his contract with Charlie
Finley's Athletics after the 1974 season, and the Yankees signed
him to a five-year, $3.35 million contract that was the largest in
baseball history at that time. While his case did not directly lead
to free agency for other players _ a ruling in an unrelated case
the next year led to that _ it showed the players what they, too,
might command from the baseball owners.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was known all his life as Jimmy in his home area. Finley,
the A's flamboyant owner, gave him the nickname Catfish and
apparently manufactured a story to go with it. ``Around here, we
never call him Catfish,'' Ray Ward, editor of The Perquimans
Weekly, had said. ``We call him Jimmy. Jimmy's mother has been
upset about the nickname.'' The story created to go with the name:
that Hunter had once run away from home and come back with two
catfish. ``His mother was irritated that somebody would believe her
little boy ran off,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter never pitched in the minor leagues, starting the 1965
season with a cellar-bound Kansas City team that had eight rookies.
He had an 8-8 record that year and was 55-64 in his first five
seasons, never finishing above .500. Despite his mediocre won-lost
records with mostly mediocre teams, Hunter was named an American
League All-Star in 1966 and 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 Finley moved the A's to Oakland, and on May 8 of that
year Hunter retired all 27 Minnesota Twins he faced, the first
regular-season perfect game in the American League since 1922.
</P>
<P>
   The A's fortunes improved dramatically after their move to
Oakland, and they quickly developed into a powerhouse that won
three straight World Series from 1972-74. Hunter also improved, and
he became the steady center of a swaggering, squabbling club that
featured larger-than-life characters like Reggie Jackson, Vida Blue
and Rollie Fingers. In his last five seasons with Oakland he
compiled a record of 106-49, and he was 4-0 in seven World Series
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   After he won the Cy Young Award in 1974 with a record of 25-12
and a league-leading 2.49 ERA., Hunter uncovered a violation of his
contract with Finley and the A's that allowed him to become a free
agent. The A's were to send half of Hunter's $100,000 annual salary
to a North Carolina bank as payment on an annuity, but Finley did
not comply.
</P>
<P>
   At season's end, with the guidance of the players' association,
Hunter took a grievance to arbitration. He won and was declared a
free agent, unfamiliar words in baseball in 1974. When he learned
of it by telephone, Hunter hung up and, shaken, turned to his wife,
Helen. ``We don't belong to anybody,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three of the 24 teams in the major leagues _ all but the
San Francisco Giants _ bid for Hunter's services. George
Steinbrenner's $3.35 million offer to pitch for the Yankees for
five years, which included a $1 million signing bonus and various
insurance policies and annuities, was the most appealing, and the
Yankees announced the signing of Hunter on New Year's Eve 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter again led the league in victories in his first season
with the Yankees, winning 23 games. He was 17-15 the following
season, when the team won its first pennant in 12 years, and he
compiled records of 9-9 and 12-6 for the Yankees' World
Series-winning teams of 1977 and 1978, despite spending time on the
disabled list during both seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter retired from baseball at age 33 when his contract expired
after the 1979 season, having suffered problems with his pitching
arm. But he found it no hardship to leave the limelight and return
to his roots. Shortly after he joined the Yankees he had said: ``I
don't like New York much, either. I had to live in a hotel downtown
for a couple of months until my wife got here. Hated it. Now I got
this nice home in Norwood, N.J., and I just drive straight from
there to the ball park. Never go downtown. Nothing for me to do
down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter and his wife, Helen, his high school sweetheart, lived in
the same house outside tiny Hertford for more than 20 years. But
their 100 acres had increased to 1,000. He was a full-time farmer
in his corn, soybean and peanut fields for 10 years after he
retired from baseball, and then he turned it over to a friend who
leased the land.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and three children, Hunter is survived
by three brothers, three sisters and a grandson.

INDEPENDENTISTA'S CHICAGO FAMILY EAGER FOR HER RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Alejandrina Torres _ one of the 14 Puerto Rican
independentistas who accepted President Bill Clinton's clemency
offer _ comes home to Chicago, her husband said he plans to hug her
and never let her out of his sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she walks in, I am going to kiss her from top to
bottom,'' said the Rev. Jos Alberto Torres, 75, a retired pastor.
``I love her so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, 60, who has been in prison for 16 years, and is
currently jailed at the Danbury Correctional Facility in
Connecticut, was profiled in a recent Globe article.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tuesday, when his wife signed the clemency agreement, he's
been pacing the house, unable to sleep. He said he's logged more
than 200 phone calls. ``The phone keeps ringing. People from Puerto
Rico are calling. The media is calling.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Catalina Torres is staying with several neices in
a motel a couple of highway exits away from the prison, waiting to
find out when she will be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard when she's coming out,'' said Norma Torres,
the oldest daughter. ``I have a reserved happiness. I will not
truly be happy until I see her come in the door. Anything can
happen. The president could change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres said she is upset about the negative publicity
surrounding her mother and the other Puerto Rican nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about them as if they were terrorists. They never
bombed anyone,'' Torres said. ``My mother was never convicted of
any violent act.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Torres says his daughters rushed to the store to get their
mother clothes, to make sure the refrigerator is filled with the
kinds of foods she likes. It's been a long time since she's had
Puerto Rican cuisine.

   His teammates call him Limo, the Texas faithful call him the
quarterback of the future, and Major Applewhite calls him his
backup. It's all a bit confusing for Chris Simms.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this attention over three series?'' Simms asked earlier
this week, overwhelmed by interview requests after going 3 of 7 for
27 yards and one touchdown in mop-up duty in the Longhorns' 69-17
rout of Stanford last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done anything yet,'' Simms said. ``I think everyone
knows Major is the starter. Everyone wants a controversy, but there
is no controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Applewhite, only a sophomore, it is a bit insulting.
``Yeah, especially when the fans and the media try to play the head
coach and decide who should be starting,'' said Applewhite, last
year's Big 12 freshman of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In a college season notable so far by the number of top teams
using rotating quarterbacks, the controversy that isn't comes to
New Jersey on Saturday when Texas (1-1) plays Rutgers (0-1). Unless
Applewhite is injured or Texas takes a big lead late into the game,
Simms, a 6-foot-5-inch left-hander, will remain on the sidelines.
It doesn't matter that he grew up 40 miles away in Franklin Lakes
and was 1998's coveted high school quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that his father, Phil, is one of the New York
metropolitan area's most beloved players for leading the Giants to
a Super Bowl victory. Texas Coach Mack Brown said for now that
there was only a lone star to quarterback his Longhorns:
Applewhite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put him in when the game was over, and we were in
control,'' Brown said of Simms' fourth-quarter college debut. ``We
did not want him to go into a situation where he could get
frustrated and fail to move the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that the Texas coaching staff is not impressed with
Simms' skills or his work ethic. ``He's got a cannon,'' Carl Reese,
the Texas defensive coordinator, said. ``He's got as good a
velocity and accuracy as anybody I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Applewhite, Texas has a quarterback who threw for 18
touchdowns and won nine games last year. He has passed for four
more touchdowns and 669 yards this season, and is the leader of a
young team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches have been really fair and really honest with me,''
Simms said. ``I'm just going week by week. I'm still learning a
lot. The basic high school defense isn't quite like the college
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The two quarterbacks have made the best of a potentially
divisive high-profile situation. When Simms threw his first
collegiate touchdown, Applewhite was among the first to shake his
hand. They room together on the road, study game film late into the
night and both say a friendship is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about how much he's helped me,'' Simms
said. ``Right away, I wasn't sure what to expect from him. I didn't
know if he would talk to me or be a rival more than a friend. But
we've gotten closer and closer.''
</P>
<P>
   When Simms chose Texas over Tennessee, where he would likely
have succeeded Tee Martin next season, Applewhite was surprised but
not rattled. ``My first reaction was we're having a wonderful
recruiting class. My second was that there's probably going to be a
lot of hype I have to deal with,'' Applewhite said. ``So the
relationship I tried to bring about was one of an older, mature guy
helping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to cut in line in front of him at the training
table. I was going get him ready as a backup while I developed into
the best starting quarterback I could be.''
</P>
<P>
   The starter's serenity and foresight has much to do with the
fact that he inherited the job early last season when Richard
Walton was injured. He remembers how much he had to grow up despite
being surrounded by Ricky Williams, the collegiate career rushing
leader, and protected by four senior lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, it's completely different,'' Applewhite said. ``We
aren't as deep and he is going to have to do a whole lot if I go
down. So I've sort of taken it as a challenge to get as many points
on the board as I can. He needs his snaps from a point of comfort,
not in an emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms has accepted his backup role and tried to play down his
high school resume and famous lineage. His father was shown
watching his son on the telecast of the Stanford game, but has
maintained a policy of not talking to the news media about his son.
He is expected to attend the Rutgers game with a hometown
contingent of family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Simms' new teammates have noticed and appreciate the effort both
quarterbacks have made for unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous talent and a lot of fun to be around,'' said
wide receiver Kwame Cavil. ``Like Major, he has all of the
intangibles you want in a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms does, however, deeply regret how he earned his nickname.
He was staying with his mother at the Four Seasons hotel in Austin
before the college dorms opened. When he was ready to move in, he
asked the hotel for transportation help. The hotel sent its
limousine service _ a white van with leather seats, a wet bar and
two female attendants dressed in black suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my mom I'm not riding in that,'' Simms said. ``I knew I
was never going to live it down.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. Some varsity players saw it on the evening news, and
the nickname Limo was born.
</P>
<P>
   For Applewhite, the challenge is to ignore the challenge his
backup will mount as he gains more experience. Some in the state
are calling for Simms to take the helm, even though Applewhite
played well in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite says he cannot worry about the week-to-week or
year-to-year status of his starting job. He knows his backup is
probably the most popular player on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he can do is make himself the best quarterback Chris Simms
can be,'' Applewhite said. ``All I can do is become the best Major
Applewhite I can be. It's kind of like a horse. You have to put the
blinders on. My goal is to win every game. Every once in while, I
take them off, look around and chuckle a bit.''

 &HT;    Judge in bias case against Coke widely regarded as smart, fair
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ U.S. District Judge Richard W. Story strode to the
bench in the cavernous downtown courtroom and took his seat. Facing
him were nine high-powered lawyers wearing thousands of dollars in
worsted wool and ready to argue one of the most high-profile cases
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   As the first hearing in the racial discrimination lawsuit
against Coca-Cola Co. got under way, Story quickly caught the
attorneys by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to argue what you have already submitted in hundreds
of pages of court motions, don't bother, the judge advised the
lawyers before a packed courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have read your briefs, each of the cases cited in your
briefs,'' Story said. ``I feel thoroughly familiar with the
positions of each of the parties, and unless you are just compelled
by the need to say that to me, I promise you, I have read every
word of it, most of it more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit deflated, knowing their showcase arguments were no longer
necessary, the attorneys sank back in their seats and answered
questions from the judge.
</P>
<P>
   That initial hearing May 13 at the Richard B. Russell Federal
Building on Spring Street moved along without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who have practiced before Story expressed no surprise at
the readiness of Atlanta's newest federal judge. Appointed to the
bench in 1997 by President Clinton, Story has gained a reputation
for intense preparation, decisiveness and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   He will need all three assets in handling the Coca-Cola case.
The lawsuit is, after all, against the world's largest maker of
soft drinks and the company most commonly identified with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Four current and former workers claim the beverage giant has
engaged in a companywide practice of discriminating against its
African-American employees.
</P>
<P>
   The company has strongly denied the allegations in the suit,
which seeks class-action status on behalf of an additional 1,500
black salaried employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So far, lawyers for both parties have kept the judge busy, and
Story has shown sensitivity to arguments raised by each side. The
judge, who often makes the 60-mile commute to Atlanta unless he can
hold court at the small federal courthouse near his home in
Gainesville, declined to be interviewed for this article, saying he
had chided lawyers involved in the Coca-Cola case enough for
talking to the media. In the spring, plaintiffs' lawyers asked
Story to rebuke Coca-Cola for e-mails Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer M. Douglas Ivester sent to employees, defending the company
against the allegations. The e-mails could inappropriately dissuade
potential black plaintiffs from joining the case, the lawyers
argued.
</P>
<P>
   Although Story warned Coca-Cola executives not to go too far in
intra-office communications, he declined to penalize the company
for Ivester's e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The suit ``causes, I'm sure, discussions in the break rooms and
all throughout the company, as well as concerns about shareholders
and the rest,'' Story said. ``As a CEO, if he did not respond in
some fashion, my guess is he would not be doing his job.''
</P>
<P>
   During a hearing on a Coca-Cola motion to block the case from
becoming a class action, Story expressed concerns about how a case
of such magnitude and complexity could be handled if hundreds of
new plaintiffs are added. Coca-Cola's lead attorney, William
Clineburg, argued that a case of that size would be impossible to
control and declared unconstitutional on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Story was unconvinced. He said he was concerned about
employees with a ``lower-paying job who may not be able to hire a
high-powered lawyer. ... If they could join together with 20 other
people, or 1,499 other people, they might could get that
representation. They might could get the issues to the table more
easily. That's of concern to the court.''
</P>
<P>
   During the July hearing, Story heard arguments on Coca-Cola's
motion to dismiss and asked numerous questions. He then asked for a
10-minute recess and, true to form, returned to the bench and
issued his order denying the company's motion and keeping alive _
for now _ the class-action claims.
</P>
<P>
   It is Story's preference to resolve issues as quickly as
possible. ``He's always been known for his promptness in getting
out orders,'' said Julius Hulsey, a Gainesville lawyer and one of
Story's former law partners. ``He's made it his habit to force
himself to make a ruling that day, if he could, not having to take
an issue home with him at night.''
</P>
<P>
   The road to the courtroom
</P>
<P>
   Story was raised in Harlem, 20 miles west of Augusta. His
father, Buck Story, once operated a gas station and dabbled in
politics, serving on the Columbia County Commission. He currently
is chairman of the county's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, ``Rick'' Story campaigned for his father, attending
political rallies and handing out fliers.
</P>
<P>
   While his father influenced Story to be civic-minded and to get
involved, his late mother, Erline, gave him a strong sense of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a tremendous role in molding him as a judge,'' said
Kenneth Brown, Story's childhood friend and now Georgia Southern
University's campus police chief. ``She, just like he can now,
could talk you into doing the right thing and make you think it was
your idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Erline Story, a radiology lab receptionist who once owned a
florist shop, died four years ago in an auto accident. ``Losing her
was terrible for the judge,'' Brown said. ``It was extremely
devastating for him.''
</P>
<P>
   A high school salutatorian, Story left Harlem to attend LaGrange
College. He earned his law degree at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Story has always kept busy, and his years at LaGrange were no
exception, his father recalled. His son had numerous part-time jobs
around campus. At tax time during one school year, Buck Story said,
he took his son's W-2 tax forms along with his own to his
accountant. ``He charged me more for Richard's tax return than he
did for mine, because he worked so many jobs,'' the father said.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the judge keeps a hectic schedule. ``If I want to
talk to him, I call at 11 o'clock at night,'' his father said.
</P>
<P>
   Story's favorite form of recreation appears to be a round of
golf. Although he declined to be interviewed, he made one exception
after learning his father had said his son was a ``scratch''
golfer, meaning he shoots even par. Story called to set the record
straight: He typically shoots 15 or 16 strokes over par. ``I
couldn't believe it when Daddy told me that,'' he said with a
chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Story began his law career working for an 85-year-old
Gainesville firm whose members have included a former Georgia
Supreme Court justice. Julius Hulsey, one of Story's former
partners at the firm, remembers Story as a lawyer who could handle
any sort of case.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people might think he's just a good old boy from
Harlem, Ga.,'' Hulsey said. ``But, shoot, he's got more between the
eyes than anyone I've run into.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Story got it in his mind that he wanted to be a judge,
there was no stopping him, Hulsey said. He first served as a
part-time juvenile judge in Hall County. In 1986, then-Gov. Joe
Frank Harris made Story, at age 33, the state's youngest Superior
Court judge at that time.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, he presided over the Northeastern
Judicial Circuit, where former colleagues gush with praise about
his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always impressed me as a judge who tries very hard to
give everyone involved in a trial a full and fair hearing and an
opportunity to present their case fully,'' said Georgia Court of
Appeals Judge J.D. Smith, who once served with Story on the
Superior Court bench.
</P>
<P>
   Story, who is active in his church and helps coach basketball
and baseball, has no agenda on the bench, said Brown, his childhood
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a right-wing conservative; he's not a left-wing
liberal,'' Brown said. ``He's what we all want judges to be _ right
down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Summer, a Gainesville lawyer and former prosecutor who tried
more than 50 cases before Story, said even if the judge issued a
ruling against him he could not get upset about it. ``It's because
he bends over backwards to listen to people,'' Summer said. ``You
walk away knowing you had a fair hearing, no matter whether it's
win, lose or draw.''
</P>
<P>
   After presiding over a medical malpractice case, Story slashed a
punitive damages verdict of $14 million to $1 million. Columbus
trial lawyer Jim Butler appealed that decision to the Georgia
Supreme Court, which unanimously upheld Story's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``His decision was reasonable,'' Butler said. ``He's one of
those rare people who seem to have been born with the temperament
of a judge. He's very bright, very patient, but also very decisive
without being harsh about it when he doesn't need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   On the federal bench, he has a reputation of being a tough
sentencing judge. He also has shown signs of independence, most
recently in his decision not to follow a federal magistrate's
recommendation to dismiss a sexual harassment case against Douglas
County District Attorney David McDade.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in 1995 by six former employees, all women,
claims that McDade threw coins down the front of employees'
blouses, required women workers to wear swimsuits at parties at his
house and used lewd expressions when referring to women in his
office.
</P>
<P>
   In his order, Story wrote that although the women ``willingly
joined in'' McDade's conduct on occasion, they also found the
district attorney's behavior ``demeaning.'' Either way, a jury
should decide whether the conduct inside the ``extremely complex
office environment'' constituted unlawful sexual harassment, Story
said. McDade is now appealing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Coca-Cola case, the judge's big decision, not expected
for months, will be whether to grant class certification. If the
plaintiffs prevail on that issue, the stakes for Coca-Cola grow
almost exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Story, has given both parties' lawyers a good deal of
leeway. ``My approach to people is that I trust you and I count on
you to do the right thing, until you prove otherwise,'' he said
during the hearing in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I treat you appropriately. So I'm going to assume that
you will conduct yourselves in the fashion that is appropriate in
the case, and when we start crossing over the lines and getting out
of bounds, then we'll tighten the restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   He also asked the attorneys, as has become his routine, not to
try the lawsuit in the news media. ``I don't think anything is
gained in this case by trying it in the media.''

CLINTON ANNOUNCES FEDERAL PROGRAM TO BUY BACK GUNS FROM PRIVATE
OWNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stepping up the federal government's fight against
gun violence, President Clinton on Thursday announced a $15 million
program to buy back firearms from private owners.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the Department of Housing and Urban Development
would provide grants of up to $500,000 to police departments around
the country to buy back and destroy as many as 300,000 weapons,
mainly in and around public housing projects. The department is
suggesting that authorities offer $50 per gun, either in cash,
food, gift certificates, toys or tickets to sporting events.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement capped a day-long rally and lobbying push
here by scores of mayors, police chiefs, religious leaders and
other local officials who favor tighter gun controls.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Every gun turned in through a buy-back program means
potentially one less tragedy,'' Clinton said at a White House
ceremony where he was flanked by mayors and uniformed police
chiefs.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said in a telephone interview
that the program would reach at least 30 sites nationwide beginning
in late November.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a gun around the house that's accessible, that's
not being used by a sportsman or a hunter, and you need a small
amount of money,'' Cuomo said, ``bring it in and we'll buy it.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The money for the federal buy-back will come from existing
department grants and does not require congressional approval.
Unlike other buy-backs, the federal program will target weapons in
and around public housing projects.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nation's 3,400 public housing authorities will be eligible
to join with local police departments in partnerships to buy back
and destroy the firearms. Grants of up to $500,000 per police
department will be provided on a first-come, first-serve basis.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Authorities will accept guns, no questions asked, said David
Egner, a housing department spokesman. But if the police later
trace the weapon to a serious crime, like a murder, the previous
owner could be prosecuted. Guns found to be stolen will be returned
to their owners.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a rally later Thursday on the steps of the Capitol, civic
leaders and law-enforcement officers praised the president's plan,
and called on House and Senate negotiators to break their impasse
and hammer out new gun restrictions, including requirements for
child-safety locks on all guns and mandatory background checks on
all people who buy firearms at gun shows.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to say to the House, join the Senate in giving us
some extra tools,'' said Mayor Wellington E. Webb of Denver, a
Democrat who is president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want gun safety because we want our cities to be safe and
our schools to be safe,'' said Mayor Paul Helmke of Fort Wayne,
Ind., who is a Republican.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hector Torres, the chief of police in Bridgeport, Conn., said in
an interview, ``We've had buy-backs in the past, and they're a
useful tool to remove weapons from the community.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and police officers who oppose stricter gun controls
held their own news conference at the Capitol, criticizing Clinton
for offering clemency to 16 Puerto Rican militants at the same time
he is seeking tougher gun restrictions. They also criticized the
visiting police chiefs for what they described as slacking off for
politics instead of tending to law enforcement.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to cardboard cut-out figures of uniformed police
officers, signifying stand-ins for officers fighting street crimes,
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who is on the House Judiciary Committee,
excoriated the visiting police chiefs for ``engaging in useless,
phoney, photo ops with the president.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The intensifying debate over gun control comes at time when
violent crime is actually on the wane nationwide. But a string of
shootings, including the massacre on April 20 at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., has provided new momentum for advocates
of tighter gun laws.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years, cities and local communities have
conducted gun buy-backs with varying degrees of success. In the
past year alone, officials in Los Angeles, Washington, Atlanta and
New York have started buy-backs.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Fishner, the criminal justice coordinator for Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani of New York, said the most recent buy-back program
operated by the New York City Police Department netted 1,800
firearms between July 15 and Aug. 15, and that one operated by the
Brooklyn district attorney's office netted 659 weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Washington, police bought back 1,164 guns in a
single day. Residents received $100 in cash for each weapon, the
money having been confiscated during anti-narcotics operations.
</P>
<P>
   And a program in Lexington, Ky., last October offered $100 in
McDonald's food gift certificates for any working handgun, pistol,
rifle or shotgun. Some 331 firearms were turned in, including old
military rifles, seven assault rifles and one gun that was stolen
from a police officer's home.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Advocates said the initiatives remove thousands of guns from
private homes, if not necessarily from the hands of criminals.
Seizing on this potential benefit, Clinton twice repeated a
sobering statistic: The rate of accidental shooting deaths for
children under 15 in the United States is nine times higher than
the rate of the other 25 industrialized nations combined.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the anecdotal evidence, there is no definitive analysis
to support that buying back firearms reduces gun violence or crime.
As a result, the housing department plans to conduct a $1 million
study of gun buy-back plans, including its own.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that gun buy-backs are largely a cosmetic effort
in a nation awash with more than 200 million firearms. Wayne
LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle
Association, said that if the administration was serious about
combatting gun crimes, it would spend the $15 million on hiring new
prosecutors and prosecuting felons.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a right to do what they want with their own
personal property,'' said LaPierre, who said the NRA does not
oppose gun buy-backs. ``But this is nothing more than a public
relations gesture that means nothing to drug dealers killing
people.''

BUSH POSTS LIST OF CAMPAIGN DONORS ON WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the early
front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, on
Thursday began posting on his Internet site a detailed list of the
size and source of every contribution to his campaign, a gesture of
voluntary disclosure that campaign finance experts said was
unprecedented in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   While the Federal Election Commission requires all candidates to
provide such information shortly after the end of each quarter _
and the government itself posts it on the Internet _ Bush said that
his campaign would update the details of its fund-raising daily. A
short time lag will occur, however, between the receipt of a
donation and its appearance on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The information Bush's aides posted on Thursday covered
contributions through two weeks ago, or Aug. 26, and although it
did not provide a total for those donations, aides said the figure
was slightly more than $49 million, a record-shattering sum.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that the daily Internet postings underscored his
support for more openness in the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans will be able to look for themselves to find out who
is helping to fund my campaign,'' Bush said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But several advocates of changes in campaign finance laws said
that the Bush campaign was also making a canny public relations
move amid clear public concern about the influence of money in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   These advocates said that Bush was specifically trying to
counter criticism that his presidential campaign was a financial
steamroller, driven by the wealthiest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realizes that there's negative reaction to how much money
he's raised and he's trying to take the sting out of it,'' said
Ellen Miller, the executive director of Public Campaign, a
nonpartisan group that promotes an overhaul of the current system
for financing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller noted, for example, that Bush's campaign was even
going beyond federal requirements by posting information about
people who donated less than $200. She said that the decision was
clearly an effort to create the impression that small donors have
contributed to Bush's windfall, when big donors have truly made the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Aides for several other candidates said they did not expect to
follow suit with what for them would amount to a time-consuming and
arduous effort.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Bush said visitors to his World Wide Web site,
www.georgewbush.com, would get a full, accurate picture of his
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they will find is that their friends and neighbors,
grass-roots people in every state in this nation, are responding to
my message of prosperity with a purpose by sending in $20 or $50 or
$100 or a maximum of $1,000 to help elect me president,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised so much money so quickly that he has already
decided not to seek federal matching funds for the Republican
primaries, freeing himself from or to be bound by spending limits
in pivotal primary states.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki Moore, a spokeswoman for Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic front-runner, who has not raised as much money as Bush,
cited that decision in appraising Bush's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a token gesture,'' Ms. Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor to Bush's Web site can see, on a seemingly endless
alphabetical inventory, that Mary Abel, a retiree from Temperance,
Mich., gave Bush $25 on Aug 16 and that Joseph Zito, a United
Parcel Service vice president who lives in Prospect, Ky., gave him
$1,000 on July 22.
</P>
<P>
   But the information is not organized in a fashion that permits a
quick tabulation of the number of donors or speedy analysis of who
they are. Advocates of new campaign finance regulations said that
Bush could have chosen a more accessible format.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it's great that they're revealing it,'' said
Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics. ``This is setting a new standard.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Makinson added, ``The format that they're using makes it
impossible to do anything but scan names. They want to make it look
like the Bush campaign is being supported by grass-roots people all
over the country. The reality is that those donors don't count for
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller, of Public Campaign, said that an analysis of money
raised by Bush and other candidates in the first two quarters
showed that 92 percent of Bush's funds came in increments of $200
or more. She said that 89 percent of Gore's money came in such
increments.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Makinson's complaint about the format of the list,
Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Bush, said that the information was
provided in a way to discourage people from electronically copying
and from using the list to make their own solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker said that the campaign had not encountered a
situation in which a donor objected to the release of his or or her
name before the end of a mandatory reporting period, and did not
expect that to happen. The current period ends on Sept. 30, after
which all the candidates will provide detailed donor information
accessible on various Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal election law, individuals can contribute no more
than $1,000 to a campaign. Political action committees can
contribute up to $5,000, and while PAC's are not usually big givers
during the presidential primaries, they fattened Bush's campaign
coffers by $213,222 during the summer months.
</P>
<P>
   That sum included contributions of $5,000 from PACs associated
with Ashland Inc.; Bracewell &AMP; Patterson, a large Texas law firm;
Credit Suisse First Boston; Delta; Mass Mutual; National
Semiconductor Corp.; Sinclair Broadcast Group and Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed raising the individual contribution limit,
which has remained unchanged for a quarter of a century, to $3,000.
He has also said he supports banning some kinds of soft money _ the
largely unregulated contributions to political parties _ but not on
as broad a level as a bill pending in Congress would.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's total fund-raising tally has clearly exceeded $50 million
by now, although aides would confirm nothing beyond the Aug. 26
figure of $49,250,000. The previous record was set by Bob Dole, the
Republican presidential nominee in 1996, who raised $31.3 million
over an 18-month period leading up to the election.

US ATTORNEY SAYS DEAL WITH HIT MAN LESSER EVIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Fla, Okla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Defending a deal that could allow confessed hit &UR;  &LR; man
John Martorano to walk free in eight years despite killing 20
people, US Attorney Donald K. Stern said that Martorano's
cooperation has solved many old murders and may help the government
build a case against corrupt former FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing more distasteful than signing this agreement
was not signing this agreement,'' said Stern, whose office brokered
the controversial deal with Martorano, 58, a former member of the
Winter Hill Gang in Somerville, a Boston suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't go forward with this agreement,'' Stern added at
a news conference Thursday, ``there would always be the lingering
suspicion that part of the reason for not going forward with this
agreement was to protect the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of a plea agreement unsealed Thursday, Martorano has
agreed to testify ``against any current or former member of local,
state or federal law enforcement, including, without limitation,
any prosecution based upon any illegal or corrupt relationship
between that individual and James (Whitey) Bulger or Stephen (The
Rifleman) Flemmi.''
</P>
<P>
   Martorano first offered to cooperate 14 months ago after
learning that Bulger and Flemmi, his former criminal cohorts, were
longtime FBI informants who had secretly betrayed him for years.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in Boston is currently investigating
allegations of FBI corruption and misconduct that were raised last
year during exhaustive hearings before US District Judge Mark L.
Wolf. The hearings exposed the cozy relationship between Bulger and
Flemmi and their FBI handlers.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, who must approve the plea agreement with Martorano, is
expected to rule within days on a defense request to dismiss a 1995
federal racketeering case against Bulger -- a fugitive for more
than five years -- Flemmi, reputed New England Mafia Boss Francis
``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme, and alleged mob soldier Robert DeLuca,
as well as a companion case against Martorano.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi claims that the FBI granted him and Bulger immunity for
their crimes, as long as they didn't kill anyone, in exchange for
information they leaked to the bureau about their rivals in the
local Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Now Martorano is alleging that Bulger and Flemmi helped him kill
some of the 20 people he has admitted murdering in Massachusetts,
Florida and Oklahoma between 1965 and 1982, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Federal documents released Thursday reveal that Martorano will
plead guilty to a federal racketeering indictment in Boston that
charges him with acts ranging from bookmaking and extortion to the
murders of 10 people on behalf of a criminal enterprise, the Winter
Hill Gang.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, federal prosecutors will recommend that he be
sentenced to 12 1/2 to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   He will plead guilty to second-degree murder in Florida and
Oklahoma -- two states that carry the death penalty -- with
assurances that prosecutors there will recommend a 15-year prison
term.
</P>
<P>
   Since Martorano will be credited for the last five years he's
spent in jail while awaiting trial on the 1995 racketeering case,
he could walk free in less than eight years, under the deal.
</P>
<P>
   By Martorano's own admission, he killed Roger Wheeler, the
millionaire chairman of Telex Corporation and owner of World Jai
Alai, on May 27, 1981 outside a Tulsa country club, according to
the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, Martorano claims that Bulger and Flemmi
orchestrated Wheeler's murder. He has also implicated at least one
former FBI agent in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's handling of Wheeler's murder has long been criticized
by local authorities. Eight months after Wheeler's murder, Winter
Hill Gang member Brian Halloran told the FBI that it had been
orchestrated by Bulger, Flemmi and former World Jai Alai president
John ``Jack'' Callahan of Winchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI found Halloran unbelievable and refused to give him a
deal, or protection. Halloran was gunned down on May 11, 1982, on
Boston's waterfront. Then on Aug. 3, 1982, Callahan's
bullet-riddled body was found in the trunk of a car at Miami
International Aiport.
</P>
<P>
   Martorano will plead guilty to both Callahan's murder and
Wheeler's murder in state court and has agreed to testify against
anyone ever implicated as accomplices in those slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Martorano's victims were in Suffolk County. Thursday
Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II also defended the
deal. ``These murders occurred 20 to 25 years ago. Not only were
these cases not solved, the truth of the matter is they were never
going to be solved,'' said Martin, noting that investigators
couldn't even find files for some of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that Martorano is going to aid the solving of
other very important crimes, what you do is ask the public to
withhold its ultimate judgment until it plays out in those
courts,'' said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex County District Attorney Martha Coakley declined to
sign the agreement, although several of the victims were slain in
that county. Even so, she didn't oppose the deal and sent a letter
to Martorano's attorney, Francis DiMento Sr., advising him that she
didn't believe she could prosecute Martorano for any of the crimes
he had admitted to in federal court because it would be double
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the federal racketeering case, Martorano has agreed
to plead guilty to the murders of Michael Milano, 30, of Allston;
Albert Plummer, 49, of Andover; William O'Brien, 32, of South
Boston; Joseph J. ``Indian Joe'' Notarangeli, 35, of Medford and
James S. ``Spike'' O'Toole, of Dorchester, all in 1973; the murders
of Notarangeli's brother, Alfred Angeli, 37, of Winchester, and
James Sousa of Waltham in in 1974; Tommy King, of South Boston, and
Edward Connors, 42, of Dorchester in 1975, and Richard J. Castucci,
47, of Revere in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   He has confessed to, but won't be charged with the 1960s murders
of Robert Palladino, 32, of Winchester; Tony Veranis, 28, of
Dorchester; John Jackson, 47, of Back Bay; Elizabeth Dickson, 19,
Douglas Barrett, 17, and Herbert Smith, 47, all of Roxbury; Ronald
Hicks, of the Fenway, and John Banno, 30, of Allston.

   Delta picks Leo Burnett agency to bring practical ads onboard
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Thurston
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Forget the floating balloons and otherworldly music.
Delta Air Lines' advertising will likely come down to Earth in the
hands of a new agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based carrier's decision to dump Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi,
whose ``On Top of the World'' campaign was deemed too obtuse,
signals a return to a more practical approach, Delta executives
said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta announced Thursday it has moved its account to Leo
Burnett, a Chicago agency that once did United Airlines' ``Fly the
Friendly Skies'' ads.
</P>
<P>
   A new Delta campaign will debut in a few months, said Martin
White, senior vice president for consumer marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want an approach that is in touch with customers and talks
candidly about their experiences and our efforts to improve
service. When we can, we might even use a bit of humor,'' said
White, who joined Delta earlier this year from US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Delta hired Saatchi 2 1/2 years ago, just before a management
upheaval at the airline. It's been no secret that the new
management team wanted changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Top of the World'' TV spots featured wafting balloons,
people gazing skyward and one-word notes signifying travelers'
reasons for flying. The theme music was the chantlike ``Adiemus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked from an overall awareness standpoint,'' White said.
``What didn't work was the meaning.'' He said it wasn't clear if
the slogan referred to the way Delta sees itself or how it treats
passengers. The tag line, in fact, was quietly dropped last spring,
and Delta suspended TV spots in June and began considering whether
to move the account.
</P>
<P>
   Recent print ads for Delta's new BusinessElite international
service took a more practical tack that may presage future
campaigns. The ads tout extra inches of personal space, and make
direct comparison to other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Four agencies, including Burnett, Saatchi, TBWA Worldwide and
Grey Advertising, sought Delta's account, valued between $50
million and $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Before hiring Saatchi, Delta had long relied on Atlanta agency
BBDO South. BBDO produced many well-remembered themes, such as ``We
Love to Fly and it Shows'' spots, but bombed with the
Olympic-themed ``Delta Marathon'' spots of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett, for its part, lost the United account in 1996 after 31
years. Other recent wins include Toys ``R'' Us and H.J. Heinz.

<P>
   ATMAKUR, India _ A central riddle of Indian politics was about
to be answered here as the cyber-savvy chief minister of one of
India's largest states, the country's most dynamic economic
reformer, rose to address a huge, raucous political rally in this
hardscrabble farm town.
</P>
<P>
   The riddle is this: How does a politician _ in this case, a
darling of the World Bank who slashed popular food subsidies early
in his term _ sell his long-term vision for economic growth to a
mostly rural, illiterate electorate that is struggling just to
survive day to day?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer: He didn't really try.
</P>
<P>
   As the chief minister, N. Chandrababu Naidu, faced the
whistling, cheering throng, this self-proclaimed CEO of Andhra
Pradesh, a man whose Web-site biography pictures him sitting at his
laptop, made no mention of his successful courtship of Bill Gates
and other corporate executives or his efforts to restore fiscal
balance to the southern state's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Rather he spoke the traditional language of social programs:
marriage halls for Muslims, irrigation canals for farmers, free
hand tools for artisans, matching grants to poor women who save
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government is for the poor,'' thundered Naidu, 49, the
son of a modest farmer. ``I lay down my life for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians across India are watching to see whether Naidu's
aggressive blend of old-style politicking and new-wave economics
gives him a victory when the votes are counted on Oct. 6. Polls
indicate he will win.
</P>
<P>
   As India's states become increasingly important in the drive for
the economic growth that is needed to pull hundreds of millions of
Indians out of poverty, state leaders like Naidu are at the
vanguard of efforts to modernize local economies and integrate them
into the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, the national government controlled where
industries could locate and sharply limited foreign investment. But
as political power shifted to the right in the early 1990s, the
government's tight grip on investment relaxed. Ever since, the
states _ some of them, like Andhra and its 80 million people,
populous enough to be among the largest nations _ have played an
ever more important role in setting the pace of economic change.
</P>
<P>
   But the steps that India and the states have taken to liberalize
the economy are only beginning to penetrate the public
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Three out of four voters questioned in a 1998 survey by the
Center for the Study of Developing Societies were simply unaware
that such momentous economic changes had taken place. In Andhra
Pradesh, whose literacy rate of 44 percent is below the national
average, 5 out of 6 had never heard about such changes.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it is not surprising that despite India's slow but
momentous transformation from a closed, state-run economy to a more
open, market-driven one, economic issues are little talked about in
the current monthlong elections.
</P>
<P>
   So far the economic changes have no proven track record of
mobilizing voters. They are complex to explain and will take years
to pay off. And they involve doing business with rich foreigners,
not necessarily a popular strategy in a country that still smarts
from colonial rule and retains a deep suspicion of the profit
motive.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, the two main national parties, the Congress Party
and Bharatiya Janata Party, generally agree that economic
liberalization should continue.
</P>
<P>
   The largest parties here in Andhra Pradesh, Congress and Naidu's
regional Telugu Desam Party, have competed for votes with subsidy
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The more extravagant state leaders of the Congress Party have
promised free electricity to farmers, a promise that national
representatives of Congress have called irresponsible. More
modestly, Naidu said he would provide subsidized cooking-gas
cylinders to a million rural women, a plan the Election Commission
vetoed as an election-year gambit to win votes.
</P>
<P>
   If politics is the art of winning and keeping power, Naidu is
certainly no innocent. Four years ago he came to power after
leading a rebellion against the chief minister at the time (and
head of his party), N.T. Rama Rao _ who also happened to be a
popular former screen idol and Naidu's father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ruthless,'' said Jairam Ramesh, economic adviser to the
Congress Party, which Naidu belonged to until he switched to his
father-in-law's group, the Telugu Desam Party, in 1983. ``He
stabbed Congress in the back. He stabbed his father-in-law in the
back. I admire his vision; he's a doer. But he's certainly not a
man of principle.''
</P>
<P>
   After his own election in 1994, Rama Rao fulfilled two promises
that plunged the state further into fiscal crisis: He sharply
increased the rice subsidy and he banned alcohol, depriving the
state of the quarter of its revenues that had been earned through
liquor taxes.
</P>
<P>
   According to a World Bank study, a higher proportion of Andhra
Pradesh's spending was going to welfare programs and subsidies than
in any other state, crowding out things like education, health,
roads and irrigation. Not surprisingly, the state's growth rate was
well below the national average.
</P>
<P>
   After stepping into his father-in-law's shoes in September 1995,
Naidu cut the rice subsidy to its previous level and lifted
prohibition on all but the cheap local liquor that is consumed by
the poor, thus restoring the state's liquor-tax income.
</P>
<P>
   He has also become the biggest pitchman for Andhra Pradesh, a
state that is rich in natural resources, with fertile farmland, a
long coastline, major rivers and plentiful mineral deposits, but
where 3 people in 10 are dirt poor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, came to
India in October 1996, Naidu flew to New Delhi to see him. Naidu's
staff had studied Wolfensohn's pet themes _ fighting corruption and
encouraging computer technology _ and Naidu wowed him. The bank has
since committed almost $3 billion to development projects in the
state, more than in any other.
</P>
<P>
   Naidu gave the same treatment to Bill Gates, flying to New Delhi
to meet him in 1997, and then to Seattle to see him last year. He
convinced Gates to locate a Microsoft research center in a new
building called Hitech City in Hyderabad. Oracle, IBM, GE Capital
and Toshiba have located there as well.
</P>
<P>
   He also lured a group of top business people, organized by the
consulting firm McKinsey &AMP; Co., who were looking for a place to
build a new $150 million business school. They had planned to
locate in Bombay, but Bal Thackeray, the political boss there,
insisted that 10 percent of the students be from Maharashtra state
and suggested a site 50 miles outside the city. Naidu set no
conditions and found a spot for the school in Hyderabad itself.
</P>
<P>
   In fact Naidu's personal courting of CEOs and his eagerness to
cut through the red tape that normally ensnares new businesses in
India has helped transform the state's image.
</P>
<P>
   A market research survey of the chief executives of 70 big
companies, conducted for Business Today magazine in 1997, found
that in just two years' time, Andhra had vaulted to 5th place, from
22nd, in a ranking of the 26 states as a desirable place to invest.
</P>
<P>
   But while Naidu was courting the international heavy hitters, he
was also tending his own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   He has pumped more money into education, health and rural
development through a vast network of local groups that have
bypassed the traditional village councils, of which many are
controlled by his political rival, the Congress Party. Naidu says
the local committees have helped involve people at the grassroots
in governing themselves, but political analysts say they have also
insured that Naidu gets credit for the state's largess.
</P>
<P>
   In the quiet of his office in Hyderabad, he explained his
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said, he is pursuing an economic plan that includes
reducing broad subsidies, privatizing the power sector, increasing
state revenues, attracting private investment and spending more on
primary education. But he must also deal with the reality that
voters want government to help them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have initiated so many things,'' he said. ``They're all
going on and will pay off after some time. But people need
something today.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent campaign swing, Naidu boarded a tiny helicopter that
darted over the delicate minarets and sprawling slums of Hyderabad
and out over vast forests and monsoon-soaked farmland.
</P>
<P>
   As the propeller droned rhythmically, his head sank to his chest
and he fell asleep, the toll of grueling campaigning visible. But
shortly before the chopper landed in Atmakur, he roused himself and
read through the list of things the state had provided the area,
the same list he would tick off for the tens of thousands of people
waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   Naidu is not a particularly handsome man, with his helmet of
black hair and patchy salt-and-pepper beard, nor is he an inspiring
speaker. But when he bounded out of the helicopter, his presence
electrified the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   After the rally, people poured into the streets of Atmakur,
where pigs root in mud puddles and young men sell salty snacks from
pushcarts. The people had come from villages all around, on foot,
by bicycle, in ox-carts, to see and hear the most powerful man in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Most were for him. Virtually all the working people interviewed
cited some direct benefit they had received from the state as their
reason for supporting either the Congress Party or him.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Ahmed, a 24-year-old mason, is for Naidu because the state
built 40 latrines in his village. Abdul Rahim, 32, recently got an
$1,100 government loan to open his own bicycle repair shop.
</P>
<P>
   And Akhtar Angadi, 21, whose family runs a tea stall, is with
Naidu because when their house was flooded, the state gave them $12
to replace water-logged food grains. ``When the floods came and
spoiled the houses, the Naidu government came to the rescue,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the more educated residents said Naidu was popular
not just because he had doled out so much patronage but because he
had done a better job at the nuts and bolts of governance.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Atmakur may not realize that he put in place a
computerized method of monitoring the quality of roads and
identifying faulty contractors, but they do know the roads are in
better shape. They may not understand the nuances of the budget,
but they notice that there are more teachers in the schools and
more doctors in the clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's calm,'' said Garimella Sarma, who has practiced medicine
here for 40 years. ``He's not exciting. He works and he makes
others work.''

LITTLE LOVE LOST AMONG MIXED DOUBLES PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cohabitation of a tennis court _ a.k.a. mixed doubles
_ is not as romantic as it might seem.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, you cannot blend love and tennis, says Anke Huber, who
has tried both with her Russian roomie, Andrei Medvedev. They had a
terrific US Open _ singly. She made the quarters, he the fourth
round. Wouldn't it have been fun to shoot for the title as a duet
in that curious heterosexual pastime, mixed?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' she frowns. ``We played together once and that
was enough. It's too stressful to play with someone you love.''
Their duet was like ``Chopsticks'' on an untuned piano.
</P>
<P>
   Better to play with a stranger whose name means love, and you
may make beautiful music together. That happened to a man whose own
name is huge among millions of Indian households, although it may
not mean much in yours: lanky 6-foot-1-inch Mahesh Bhupathi of
Bangalore.
</P>
<P>
   When Ai Sugiyama, who is about a foot shorter, proposed to
Bhupathi mixing it up at the US Open, he eagerly accepted. ``I've
had good luck with Japanese women,'' says Bhupathi, having won the
French mixed with Rika Hiraki in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His good fortune continued Thursday at Flushing Meadow. Ai
(that's ``love'' in Japanese) and Mahesh went together like Juliet
and Romeo, Isolde and Tristan, Lucy and Desi _ although strictly
platonic. They blended like gin and vermouth, apple pie and ice
cream, lox and bagels to win the mixed championship over Americans
Kimberly Po and Don Johnson, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Although mixed is considered by people like Pete Sampras and
Lindsay Davenport an unnatural act that they wouldn't be caught
dead committing, it wasn't exactly Ma and Pa Kettle stuff. Bhupathi
and Sugiyama cut up $124,000, presumably equally.
</P>
<P>
   Po and Johnson split $62,000, which Don said will help with his
wife's tuition at the University of North Carolina medical school.
Krista Johnson, training to be an orthopedic surgeon (a handy
person for a tennis pro to have around), says she gives a better
slice with scalpel than racket.
</P>
<P>
   Crossword puzzle degenerates will tell you that ``ai'' also
means three-toed sloth. However, there was nothing slothful about
the delightful Sugiyama. She toe-danced energetically side to side
along the baseline, grinning throughout, while Bhupathi ruthlessly
patrolled the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `you' a lot because it's better if a man like Mahesh
takes the overhead smashes,'' she recounts. She knows the drill, as
does her father, a dentist in Kanagawa, not far from Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Eichi Kawatei of the Japanese Tennis Federation was just as
pleased as Ai. ``She is the first of our country to win an American
title since Kosei Kamo and Atsushi Miyagi won the US men's doubles
at Boston in 1955.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubles is the black sheep of the Open, and, regrettably, has
been since 1968. Then the partnership events were moved to New York
from Longwood Cricket Club, to be overshadowed by singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When doubles stood on its own in Boston, as a separate
championship, it was special,'' says Australian Davis Cup captain,
John Newcombe, a champ in 1967 with Tony Roche.
</P>
<P>
   But doubles is ``very big at home now,'' says a top Indian
journalist, Atul Premnarayen. ``At least our two boys _ Bhupathi
and Leander Paes. Everyone knows and reveres them for their
historic feats, and they have many endorsements.''
</P>
<P>
   Paes, a peppery little guy from Calcutta, bouncing around like a
Nerf ball, and his courtmate, Bhupathi, are in the doubles title
bout Friday against the Canadian-American alliance of Sebastian
Lareau and Alex O'Brien. The Indians have already won the French
and Wimbledon titles this year, and lost the Australian final,
attaining a No. 1 planetary ranking. This is a climb even better
than the Indian rope trick and hotter than fierce rogan josh curry.
</P>
<P>
   Bhupathi and Paes are only the second team ever to make it to
all four major finals in one year. Aussies Ken McGregor and Frank
Sedgman won the four in 1951 for a Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the only Indians to win major titles,'' says Paes,
Olympic bronze medalist in singles at Atlanta in 1996. ``It's very
gratifying. Wherever we play Indians show up to cheer us.''
Impressively. You expect Gunga Din to dash onto the court with
high-fashion water for them, and you are thrilled when their fans
begin serenading.
</P>
<P>
   Paes explains, ``The song they sing to us is called `Share
Jahaan Se Acha Hindustan Hamara.' '' A catchy title. ``In Hindi it
means `Our Country is the Most Beautiful.' It's a folk song 16
years old. In 1983, an air force pilot, Rakesh Sharma, became an
astronaut, orbiting on a space shot with a US team. When our prime
minister, Indira Gandhi, asked him what it was like, he replied
that of all he saw our country was the most beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we win the championship of the United States that will
be beautiful, too.''

DANFORTH WILL ASK `DARK QUESTIONS' ABOUT FBI SIEGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., on Thursday
launched an independent investigation of the 1993 FBI siege of the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, saying he will focus
solely on whether federal agents helped set a deadly fire and then
tried to conceal their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, who is investigating at the request of Attorney
General Janet Reno, pledged to determine if the FBI ignited the
inferno by firing pyrotechnic munitions at the religious sect's
facility. Reno, who for six years denied that federal agents used
flammable devices, appointed Danforth this week after the FBI
recently acknowledged firing pyrotechnic gas containers during the
siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to answer the dark questions,'' Danforth said. ``Did
the government kill people and did the government cover it up?''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with Reno at the Justice Department, Danforth vowed to
get to the truth and said he had no ``preconceived ideas'' of what
happened April 19, 1993, or whether federal agents later lied about
what occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth will have broad authority to collect evidence and
subpoena witnesses. He will have the title of special counsel and
may impanel a grand jury to investigate criminal wrongdoing if he
believes crimes might have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first priority is to get to the facts,'' said Danforth,
who left the Senate in 1995 to return to private law practice.
``We're going to do whatever is necessary to get to the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, 63, said he and his deputy, U.S. Attorney Edward Dowd
Jr. of St. Louis, would conduct an objective and ``expeditious''
investigation but gave no timetable for its completion. ``I don't
want this to go on and on,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 75 Branch Davidians, including cult leader David
Koresh, were killed by gunfire and the blaze that erupted during
the raid. Despite the FBI's recent revelations, Reno said she
continues to believe that Branch Davidians are solely responsible
for starting the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, noting the independence of his investigation, said he
intends to avoid using federal agents ``to the maximum extent that
I can'' in conducting the inquiry. Instead, he said he would rely
largely on ``private sector'' attorneys and investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the FBI should be investigating the FBI,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mandate from Reno, Danforth also may prosecute federal
crimes, should he deem it ``necessary and appropriate,'' that may
have occurred during the FBI siege and its aftermath. These crimes
might include perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of
evidence or intimidation of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has authority to oversee the special counsel's work,
recused herself from any oversight. She said it would be improper
because Danforth might find it necessary to question her in light
of her testimony before Congress that the FBI used no pyrotechnic
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will obviously be a witness,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Reno, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. will
oversee Danforth. Holder was a Superior Court judge in Washington,
D.C., when the raid occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said Holder has assured him that he will have free
reign. ``I wouldn't have done this without it,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth also will examine whether the U.S. military was
illegally involved in the FBI raid, because of allegations that the
Army's elite Delta Force anti-terrorism unit was present the day of
the raid. The Pentagon has acknowledged that military personnel
were there, but only in a consulting role.
</P>
<P>
   Under Justice Department regulations, Danforth must submit to
Reno a confidential report. In addition, Danforth said he will
submit a final report to be made available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role is to give the American people knowledge of what
happened,'' Danforth said. But he added that any testimony before a
grand jury would have to be kept confidential under federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier federal investigation of the raid concluded that some
Branch Davidians shot fellow members and deliberately set the fire
during the siege, which occurred after a 51-day stand off between
the cult and federal officers.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he will confine his investigation to whether
federal agents acted improperly, not whether they made errors in
judgment by engaging in a long stalemate with the cult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into judgment calls even if the judgment
calls led to the (deadly) result.'' he said. ``Our country can
survive bad judgment. The thing that really undermines government
is whether there were bad acts.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's recent revelations about the use of pyrotechnic
munitions has led many Republicans, including Sen. Phil Gramm of
Texas and Senate GOP Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, to call for
Reno's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful Republican chairmen, such as Senate judiciary committee
leader Orrin Hatch of Utah, have called for congressional hearings
regarding what Reno and the FBI knew and when they knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he planned to meet with congressional leaders
about his investigation but said he would not advise them on
whether they should proceed with their committee hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he will press ahead with a congressional inquiry,
despite noting his ``great deal of respect'' for Danforth as a
former Senate colleague and former Missouri attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, talking to reporters at the White House,
applauded the selection of Danforth, calling him ``an honorable man
and an intelligent and straightforward man. The only thing I would
ask is that he conduct a through and prompt investigation.''

(dal) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a good 48 hours for John McCain, the author,
and a priceless 48 hours for John McCain, the presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning a two-week national book tour for ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' a memoir of his life and the lives of his father and
grandfather, both Navy admirals, the Republican senator was getting
as much attention, at least for a moment, as the his party's
presumptive presidential front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Don Imus, the iconoclastic radio personality, skated close to
giving McCain an endorsement in a sometimes playful interview on
Wednesday, admitting he liked both the Arizona senator and Democrat
Bill Bradley. The ABC news program ``20/20'' ran a harrowing
portrait of McCain's 5{ years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   The senator taped appearances with Brian Williams of MSNBC,
Geraldo Rivera of CNBC and appeared on NBC's ``Today'' show. And
for 90 minutes Thursday he was the center of attention, signing
books for a long line of customers at the Barnes &AMP; Noble store in
Rockefeller Center. One, 65-year-old Hal Keith of Long Island, not
only bought six books, he also gave McCain a baseball to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The whirlwind two days in New York City showed just why the book
and the book tour have become staples of presidential politics,
with several of the current crop of contenders vying for attention.
It's a collaboration among talk shows looking for a steady stream
of personalities, candidates seeking a platform to catapult them
into the spotlight and publishers promoting book sales.
</P>
<P>
   None of the candidates this year have ignited the kind of
orchestrated media furor that Gen. Colin Powell did four years ago
when he left it ambiguous whether he was selling his memoir, ``My
American Journey,'' or beginning a presidential campaign. ``That
was the literary equivalent of Garbo speaks,'' said Jonathan Karp,
McCain's editor at Random House, which also published Powell.
``Colin Powell was the ultimate seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   But a number of contenders are taking advantage of the extra
platform provided by a book and often a book tour _ with at least
some of the expenses likely to be picked up by the publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission has no formal rulings about who
pays for a book tour by a presidential candidate, said Ian Stirton,
a spokesman, but he said an advisory opinion states that campaigns
cannot combine publishing events with campaign events such as a
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to all of the presidential candidates conducting book
tours said that their campaigns were paying for travel in cases
where book signings were being sandwiched between political events.
Book events would not have to be reported as campaign expenses,
making it difficult to determine how much the publishers are paying
for travel.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan is set to begin a two-week tour this weekend to
promote ``A Republic, Not An Empire,'' his explanation of how he
believes American foreign policy went badly astray. His publisher,
Regnery Publishing, is using the speculation about a third-party
bid by Buchanan to draw attention to the book. ``Why would Pat
Buchanan break ranks with the Republican Party?'' asks the press
release accompanying the book. ``If he does, the break point will
almost surely be U.S. foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, also in a Regnery book, titled ``A New Birth of
Freedom,'' showcases a conservative agenda ranging from the flat
tax to privately invested Social Security funds to how to ban
abortions, step by step.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle's campaign book, ``Worth Fighting For,'' was released
earlier this summer by Word Publishing, a Christian publisher based
in Nashville, Tenn. It argues for a return to more traditional
American values. In it, he made sure to feature, as an example of
the cultural elite at work, the rejection note that Ann Godoff, the
Random House president and editor in chief, sent to his agent,
saying, ``I just don't want to be a party to the promulgation of
ideas I disagree with so profoundly.'' He has just begun the second
part of a book tour.
</P>
<P>
   Both Alan Keyes and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas are preparing
books. Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Bush, said he had not made a
final decision to go ahead with the book, although he has William
Morrow lined up as the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other candidates are already authors, including
Elizabeth Dole, who wrote a joint autobiography with her husband,
Bob Dole, in 1996, and Gary Bauer, as well as the Democrats Bradley
and Vice President Al Gore. Bradley does not have another book in
the works. Nor does Mrs. Dole. But Kiki Moore, a spokeswoman for
the vice president said, ``An author can never rule out an
opportunity to do another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Political figures have long defined themselves through books,
from John F. Kennedy with ``Profiles in Courage,'' to Barry
Goldwater with ``Conscience of a Conservative.'' Those in the
literary world and in politics say the current crop of books is
driven in large part by the desire of both voters and the political
candidates to escape the filter of reporters and political pundits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a climate where politically, people don't trust anybody, it
makes people feel that they are getting as intimate a look at the
politician as they possibly can, because it's the politician's own
words,'' said Cathy Saypol, the president of CSPR, a public
relations firm that specializes in promoting nonfiction books. In
fact, not all candidates write the books themselves. McCain's
coauthor was Mark Salter, a longtime aide.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Bush had no intention of putting out an
autobiography, his spokeswoman said. But in the past year, she
said, a number of Texas journalists made clear that they were
working on biographies in anticipation of his run, and the campaign
knows of at least three such books in the works. Bush then began
considering his own book, she said, thinking, ``I want to have at
least one that tells the story right.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's book has attracted attention precisely because it is
not a traditional campaign book. It sets out no political agenda
but rather tells the story of the senator, his father, the
commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific during the Vietnam War, and
his grandfather, who commanded much of the U.S. Navy in the Pacific
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It tells of McCain's hell-raising days as a rebel who graduated
fifth from last from the Naval Academy, but who went on to survive
torture, isolation and torment as a prisoner of war. It ends before
he begins a life in politics.
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he began the book well before he decided to run for
president. But his aides make clear that they think his wartime
valor and personal story are central to his appeal. Because of the
book, television and radio correspondents have been highlighting
his story. On ``20/20,'' McCain's elegant 87-year-old mother even
appeared, saying roguishly that she is proud of her son ``because
he's such a scamp.''  &QL;

<P>
   As of Thursday afternoon, according to Karp, ``Faith of My
Fathers'' had become the No. 5 seller on Amazon.com, the cyberspace
bookstore, and Random House had done a second printing bringing the
total number of books to 159,488.
</P>
<P>
   Soheil Nasseri, a 20-year-old music student who waited for
McCain's autograph and had already read his book, said he had
become interested in politics because of McCain. ``If you read this
book, you'll see he's like no politician America has ever seen,''
he said after meeting the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Liisa Lawrence of Connecticut picked up books for a slew of male
relatives including her husband who she said was fascinated by
military history. ``My husband is a McCain fan,'' she said.
``However, he's voting for somebody else,'' she added, naming
Bradley.

MEXICAN DEBATE SHATTERS TRADITIONS WITH NAME CALLING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In a rare display of political candor, the leading
candidates in the governing party's presidential primary race
clashed on nationwide television, hurling epithets and accusations
as they marched into the uncharted terrain of an electoral debate
that centered on jobs, crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, a former interior
minister who appears to have the silent support of President
Ernesto Zedillo, and Roberto Madrazo Pintado, a onetime state
governor who has surged to a narrow lead in polls, attacked each
other with a gusto rarely exhibited by leaders of the party during
its 70-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, the first ever for the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, known as the PRI, became the second piece of riveting
political theater in days. Moments after Zedillo delivered his
state of the union address last week, an opposition congressman
upbraided him for his policies, interrupting decades of saccharine
deference toward Mexican executives.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, who has been transformed in recent months by television
commercials from a minor regional politician into a contender,
struck first in the television debate on Wednesday, accusing
Labastida of being the ``official candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The official candidate just wants to continue with the same
failed policies we have now,'' Madrazo said, glaring at Labastida.
``And that's logical, because he represents everything you and I
want to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, who has until now appeared to put party unity above
the need to engage his rivals in political combat, shot right back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just another lie, one in a long series of lies you've
told,'' he said, gazing stonily at Madrazo. ``Roberto, frankly you
have two faces,'' Labastida added, accusing his rival of misquoting
him in television commercials and insinuating that Madrazo had
enriched himself from public coffers while governor of Tabasco
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenge you, Roberto, to make public your personal wealth,
let professional auditors see what you have, let them see how much
you made when you were governor,'' Labastida said.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong debate appeared to consolidate the domination of
the race by Labastida and Madrazo. Two other candidates who took
part, Manuel Bartlett Diaz, a former governor, and Humberto Roque
Villanueva, a former House speaker, are trailing badly and were
largely ignored by the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen post-debate telephone polls offered contradictory
results, with some attributing victory to Madrazo and others to
Labastida. The discrepancies suggested that some results may have
been manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's carefully prepared assault on Madrazo's honesty will
be followed by sharp criticism, Alejandro Valenzuela, a spokesman
for Labastida, said Thursday. ``Madrazo is a wolf dressing himself
up as a sheep, and we want people to know he's a wolf,'' Valenzuela
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Carlos Alazraki, the advertising consultant who has planned
Madrazo's campaign, expressed satisfaction Thursday over
Labastida's attacks. ``Labastida bit on our hook completely,'' said
Alazraki, who is working with several American media consultants,
including Thomas O'Donnell, a former chief of staff to Rep. Richard
A. Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gringo advisers told me, `Carlos, in a debate never get
hooked on a rival's attack,''' Alazraki said. ``A debate is a free
commercial in which to sell yourself. But Labastida got hooked on
us, he kept answering us instead of presenting his own issues.''
</P>
<P>
   PRI functionaries offered their own spin. Minutes after the
debate concluded, Elba Esther Gordillo, a prominent PRI official,
pushed her way into a crowd of journalists at a press center and
asserted that the party itself, which is seeking to adjust to
modern electoral competition after decades of one-party rule, had
won the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the PRI, and no other party, that's blazing the trail for
democracy,'' Ms. Gordillo said.
</P>
<P>
   But the description of Mexico offered by all four candidates was
unflattering to the party that has ruled since 1929. The candidates
described a country in ruins, with an economy of crony capitalism
and a justice system mired in corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's primary vote is scheduled for Nov. 7, and the
presidential balloting for July 2.

 &HT;    Hardware to hard rock: Ex-modem magnate resurfaces as nightclub
owner
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's early afternoon and Dennis C. Hayes, the man who
once dominated the computer-modem industry, is conducting business
over a lunch of rare tuna at a Norcross restaurant called Hi-Life.
His cell phone rings, another in a stream of calls. It's the office
with a question:
</P>
<P>
   What should we do with the free-tattoo certificates for winners
of the What If Satan Were a Girl contest?
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, until recently chairman of the $200-million-a-year Hayes
Corp., now owns and runs a hard rock/heavy metal bar on Buford
Highway. He opened the Whiskey Rock in February, four months after
he resigned as chairman of Hayes Corp. and the company filed for
its second bankruptcy in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Picture what the reaction would be if Bill Gates bailed out of a
sinking Microsoft to run a grunge club in Seattle, and you get an
idea of what it means for Hayes to become the proprietor of the
Whiskey Rock. Those who knew Hayes before hardly recognize him now,
and not just because of the dramatic career shift. The tall, tanned
49-year-old has lost dozens of pounds, along with more than $100
million in Hayes stock.
</P>
<P>
   He's downsized his lifestyle, too. Hayes sold his $1.55 million
Duluth mansion in November and bought a $223,000 home in an
suburban Atlanta subdivision. The company-paid membership in the
exclusive Atlanta Athletic Club is gone, replaced with a
$34-a-month fitness center. He's due in Fulton County Superior
Court today to answer charges by ex-wife Mina Chan that he isn't
paying child support or alimony.
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't abandoned the high life altogether. A gleaming
Lincoln Navigator, still with dealer tags, sits in his driveway. He
employs a housekeeper, an administrative assistant and a driver
(Hayes suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye
disease) and he ran up a $2,000 cell phone bill last month.
</P>
<P>
   What he's doing at the Whiskey Rock is also a mixture of change
and old habits. He's thrown himself into a new role, but kept the
around-the-clock work habits and aggressive hands-on management
style that marked his career _ some would say eventually doomed it
_ at Hayes. He fired the bar's first manager, brought in new
managers and is running the place himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing fine. I survived a tragedy and got my life pretty
focused on doing other things,'' he says. ``Sometimes I think of
Hayes as a big train wreck. It's unfortunate that happened, but
...'' and Hayes' voice trails away.
</P>
<P>
   He still has a connection with the high-tech world through his
consulting company, Virtual Resources, and is chairman of the
Association of Online Professionals, an Internet trade association.
Yet it's in a discussion about the Whiskey Rock that Hayes, who
carefully parcels out his words, really opens up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about what's going on in the economy, you've got
major industries like telecommunications, cable television,
consumer electronics, computers, all coming together. The other
thing that's coming together with them is entertainment, because
you've got to have something to do with all that infrastructure,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to learn about entertainment, and I like the idea of
doing a rock 'n' roll bar. It's been amazing how much fun it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Jody Harris, who worked as Hayes' staff manager for several
years at Hayes Corp., says she laughed on first hearing that he'd
opened a bar. But she seems to understand the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it's a long-term ambition,'' she says, ``but it
lets him try new things. He's a little burned out on the technology
arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still lets him run something, because he'll never be able
to report to any other individual, and it still lets him try some
technology things.''
</P>
<P>
   The bar, next to a strip club that Hayes touts as a drawing card
for the Whiskey Rock, has had mixed success. As at most live-music
venues, crowds vary depending on who's playing and have ranged from
zero to its capacity of 400. Alan Ayo of 96 Rock, the club's disc
jockey three nights a week, handles the bookings. Hayes works on
some band appearances too, like the Sept. 25 debut of Amazing
Disgrace, composed of former members of Atlanta's Beltfed and Stuck
Mojo, and New York's Life of Agony. He takes a hand in promotions,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to be innovative,'' Hayes says. ``We got tired of the
old wet T-shirt and bikini contest, so we said, `What can we do
that'll be even better?' And we put together a contest that was
called What If Satan Was a Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   And what if Satan were a girl?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, she looked pretty good,'' Hayes says, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   He's become friends with some of the musicians who play his
club, and goes with them to other music venues to check out the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Old habits notwithstanding, it's all quite a switch from the
last two years at Hayes Corp., as the business slid toward its
second bankruptcy. As a condition for emerging from the first
bankruptcy in 1996, Hayes, the company's principal stockholder, was
forced to surrender control of its daily operations. New management
didn't help matters, and last October the company filed for
bankruptcy again. By March, the company's Peachtree Corners
manufacturing facility was closed and its designs, inventory and
equipment auctioned off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like being chained in a corner and watching a monster
tear off your children's arms and legs and not being able to do
anything about it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He says he had hoped to retire within two years after the
company emerged from its first bankruptcy. Former associates,
however, find it hard to believe that a man with such a reputation
as a workaholic would be content with retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes Corp. ``meant everything to him, and losing it had to be
the great personal tragedy of all time,'' says Glenn R. Sirkis, a
former executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes says that he invested in commercial sites near the Mall of
Georgia when he saw Hayes Corp. starting to go down for the second
time, but that's about all he'll say on whether he has any money
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not nearly as much as I used to,'' Hayes says, chuckling a
little nervously. ``I'm surviving. I'm surviving nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes is equally guarded in talking about his contentious
divorces, especially the 1988 one from first wife Melita Easters
Hayes. After Hayes filed for divorce, his wife accused him of
engaging in an adulterous relationship with Mina Chan, a company
employee whom he married soon after the first divorce was granted.
That divorce settlement was reported as one of the state's largest.
He disputes that characterization, saying it's impossible to verify
because the agreement was sealed. In addition to alimony and child
support, Melita Hayes did come out of the divorce with 9.4 percent
of the company's stock, which she sold back to the company for $11
million.
</P>
<P>
   Chan, whom Hayes divorced in 1998, filed a complaint last
October charging that he had not complied with terms of their
sealed agreement, including alimony payments of about $15,000 due
in September and October 1998. She amended the complaint in June,
saying he also had fallen behind on child support payments of
$5,000 a month and owed $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   They're due in court for a hearing today. Chan says Hayes hasn't
paid her anything since the complaint was filed. Hayes says only:
``I've been doing what I should.''
</P>
<P>
   It's another afternoon, and Hayes is talking in the great room
of his home. A pitcher of Bloody Marys sits on the coffee table in
front of him. In the basement, musician Erik Rogers of Amazing
Disgrace and Hayes' assistant wait for him to start working on a
performance plan for the band's show at the Whiskey Rock. Prints of
Vargas pinups and Nagel-esque women line the foyer, dining room and
stairway. A collection of Asian art, including a 2,000-year-old
horse statue, fills display cases in two rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his art collection, however, is gone. His original
Vargas paintings are being sold through a San Francisco art shop,
Hayes says.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, the singer for Amazing Disgrace, has spent a lot of time
at the club and a good bit of time away from it with Hayes. As he
talks about their scouting trips to other entertainment venues and
the record deal he hopes the band will land, Hayes listens with a
slight smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis has been a good friend of ours, helped us out with a
lot of things. It's tough to find a venue that bends over backward
to help you,'' Rogers says.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes offers a more pragmatic take: ``It's not just that, it's
what we can do to get in a bigger audience and a good night for the
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes has just returned from his father's funeral in
Spartanburg, S.C. Grover ``G.C.'' Hayes died of cancer earlier in
the week. He was a retired telephone lineman; Hayes' mother, Sadie,
a switchboard operator, took a break from work to raise him and his
younger brother, Gary.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Hayes left Spartanburg to attend Georgia Tech,
then dropped out just shy of graduation to work as an engineer for
National Data Corp. There he met Dale Heatherington, and the two
started D.C. Hayes Associates in 1978 with $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was determined. He definitely went after what he wanted,''
recalls Heatherington, who sold his share of the company in 1984
and retired. He's seen little of Hayes since.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has Sirkis, the former executive vice president who
owned nearly a third of the just-starting-to-ignite company before
Hayes fired him in 1982 and bought his stock back at book value for
less than $500,000. The year before, Sirkis was a best man at
Dennis Hayes' first wedding. He still bristles at the way he was
treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were excellent friends up until the week I didn't
work there anymore,'' Sirkis says.
</P>
<P>
   Others shared similar experiences. In 1996, Hayes fired two
senior executives and pressured another to step up his departure.
The company then sued the three, who had been critical of Hayes'
management style in bankruptcy court hearings, contending they owed
the company $5 million for insubordination. The three men
countersued Hayes and the company for $40 million. Two of them
charged they were libeled after being fired. The suits are still
pending.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, Hayes, who had bought out or fired his early partners,
dominated the company. And the company dominated the modem market.
</P>
<P>
   But as technology and the economics of manufacturing changed,
the company didn't. During the first bankruptcy, Hayes could have
sold his stock for $123 million to Diamond Multimedia Systems. He
turned down the offer, and the company's fortunes continued to
decline. By the time it filed for bankruptcy again in 1998, Hayes
Corp. held just 3.3 percent of the modem market.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely felt he had to prove something, and I don't
think he was ever at the point where he thought he had proven
enough,'' Sirkis says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could all have walked away from the company in the mid '80s
with a couple of hundred million dollars each,'' he says. ``The
first Mrs. Hayes and Dale Heatherington are the only people who got
any real money out of the deal. I do consider this a great tragedy,
and you do have to call Dennis a tragic figure.''
</P>
<P>
   As he's always done, Hayes is throwing himself into work and
hanging out with business associates _ these days, musicians 20
years younger than him. At the club, a spartan place with concrete
floors, black walls, a couple of pool tables and a killer sound
system that'll leave your ears ringing for a day, he leans against
the bar, a slim guy in a black sports shirt and black jeans in a
room full of twentysomethings wearing baseball caps, untucked
T-shirts and baggy pants. He's drinking a Madras; they're drinking
$2 beers in plastic cups.
</P>
<P>
   His determination to make a success of the club is familiar to
those who worked with him at Hayes. Chan, who worked for the
company as an executive while married to Hayes, has her share of
differences with him. But she thinks the high-tech world shouldn't
count him out yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he used to be Dennis Hayes of Hayes Microcomputers, he
used to feel the world stopped for him. I think he can come back,
though. He's a very smart man, he really is. His sense of vision is
very strong.

CLINTON DEMANDS END OF VIOLENCE IN EAST TIMOR
</HEADLINE>
   (Also see TIMOR-RDP, TIMOR-U.N. and TIMOR-INDONESIA-MILITARY) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton demanded on Thursday that
Indonesia permit an international peacekeeping force to restore
order in East Timor if the Indonesian military is unable to end the
``madness'' that has swept the tiny province since it voted for
independence last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Indonesia does not end the violence, it must invite _ it
must invite _ the international community to assist in restoring
security,'' the president said at the White House as he prepared to
leave for an Asia-Pacific economic summit in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   But the president did not threaten an immediate cutoff of
economic assistance to Indonesia, as some lawmakers and human
rights groups had wanted. Nor did he cut off commercial arms sales
to Indonesia, which are expected to total about $16 million over
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton announced that he had ordered the Pentagon to
suspend its few formal contacts with the Indonesia military, and
that he would consider economic sanctions if the killings in East
Timor did not stop. ``My willingness to support future assistance
will depend very strongly on the way Indonesia handles this
situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the United States was prepared to assist Australia
in its efforts to form an international peacekeeping force for East
Timor, although he made clear that no decision had been made on the
extent of American involvement in the mission. The Pentagon has
said that there are no plans to send American ground troops to East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has faced a difficult calculation in
deciding how to react to the bloodletting that began after last
week's independence referendum in East Timor. Hundreds of people
are reported to have been killed by anti-independence militias
backed by elements of the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   While strongly protesting the violence, the United States wants
to preserve a relationship with the civilian government led by
President B.J. Habibie, which has been responsible for a variety of
democratic reforms in Indonesia, a archipelago nation of more than
200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor, a former Portuguese colony of about 800,000 people
that is closer to Australia than it is to most of Indonesia, was
invaded and annexed by Indonesia in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton touched on the larger policy dilemma when, at the
beginning of his remarks on East Timor, he saluted Indonesia for
its ``important democratic transformation _ it has the capacity to
lift an entire region if it succeeds and to swamp its neighbors in
a sea of disorder if it fails.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Indonesia's economy, which was ravaged by the
Asian economic crisis, had begun to rebound in recent months,
largely as a result of billions of dollars in American-backed
emergency aid to Indonesia through the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a pity if the Indonesian recovery were crashed by
this,'' he said of the crisis in East Timor. ``But one way or the
other, it will be crashed by this if they don't fix it, because
there will be overwhelming public sentiment to stop the
international economic cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Precisely because Indonesia's future is important, I am so
deeply concerned by the failure of its military to bring a stop to
gross abuses now going on in East Timor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of military cooperation between the United States
and Indonesia is little more than symbolic, since military ties
between the two countries have been sharply limited by Congress in
recent years because of human rights abuses attributed to the
Indonesian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ended bilateral military exercises with
Indonesia last year. As a result of Thursday's action, the United
States will freeze a $470,000-a-year military training program
between the two countries and a handful of officer exchange
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Informal contacts between the two countries will continue.
Clinton administration officials said that the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, intended to remain in
close contact with his Indonesian counterpart, Gen. Wiranto, who is
considered the key figure in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance on Capitol Hill on his nomination for a second
two-year term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Shelton said that he
had spoken with Wiranto by phone on Monday and ``laid out for him
in no uncertain terms what I thought we needed to see from
Indonesia, and specifically from him.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he said the United States was alarmed by the violence
that has overwhelmed East Timor, Shelton stressed that American
national security interests were not on the line in the tiny
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly if you look at East Timor by itself, I cannot see
any national interest there that would be overwhelming _ would call
for us to deploy or place U.S. forces on the ground in that area,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The general instead described the crisis in East Timor as a
``moral issue'' that ``very clearly challenges our role as a leader
with other nations in that region of the world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged on Thursday that the United States was
unclear on exactly how decisions were being made in Jakarta, the
Indonesian capital, about how to deal with the killings in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was possible that ``nobody's got the authority''
among Indonesia's military or civilian leaders to quell the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was also imaginable that ``at least some elements in
the country support what is happening in East Timor, for whatever
reasons _ in other words, they didn't like the results of the
referendum and they're trying to undo it by running people out of
the country or into the grave.''

LATE BUYING PUSHES NASDAQ NEAR RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Computer and other high-technology stocks rose
Thursday, lifting the Nasdaq market to just shy of its mid-July
record, as late buying transformed losses for the other major
gauges into modest gains.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was dampened early by concern about the yen's making a
three-year high against the dollar and another sharp rise in oil
prices, as well as worry about a government report on August
inflation due on Friday. After lunch, however, the atmosphere for
some reason _ perhaps the arresting of a skid in bond prices _
improved, and a majority of stocks finished higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stage was set for a bad day, but then strength in
technology offset it,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment
officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's gain was 43.28 points, or 1.52 percent, bringing it
to 2,852.02, or less than one-half of 1 percent shy of the 2,864.48
peak reached on July 16 and 30 percent higher for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which in mid-afternoon showed
a 54-point loss, rebounded to a closing gain of 43.06 points, or
0.39 percent, to stand at 11,079.40. That is 2.2 percent under its
high set Aug. 25; it is up 20.7 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was the laggard, with weakness in
financial stocks helping limit its gain to 3.51 points, or 0.26 of
1 percent. At 1,347.66, the index is up 9.63 percent so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing S&AMP; P stocks outnumbered declining ones by just 248 to
228, continued evidence of a lack of market breadth that seems to
have unsettled analysts more than anything else _ except the
possibility of another round of monetary tightening by the Federal

   ``It's been really a mixed market'' of late, said Frank D.
Korth, growth-stock director at National City Investment Management
in Cleveland. ``We still have the risk that there will be one more
increase in interest rates, though it may well come after the new
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew M. Brooks, who is in charge of equity trading at T.
Rowe Price, said, ``I bet we're done'' with rate increases,
suggesting that contrarians might want to buy stocks in October, a
month that traditionally makes investors nervous.
</P>
<P>
   There was little, if any, noticeable effect on Thursday's market
from the fact that the date was 9/9/99, which some had worried
might disable computers in a foretaste of year 2000 problems at
year's end. Nor did it prove significant that it was the 55th day
after the July 16 record; numeric-obsessives had pointed out that
was the interval at which both the 1929 and 1987 crashes began.

   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange remained moderate, easing

   With crude oil soaring above $23 a barrel on slim inventories,
oil stocks joined computer-related issues to be among the day's
best-performing groups. The S&AMP;P's index of international oils
jumped 1.7 percent to a record and was up more than 3 percent at
its best level.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron surged 3[, to 97 9/16, Atlantic Richfield climbed 3|, to
91, Royal Dutch 2], to 64~, and Texaco 1 11/16, to 67]. Service
companies also bounded ahead, including Halliburton 2~, to 50}, and
Schlumberger 3], to 70 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines stocks, which often suffer when oil prices rise, did
well this time after a Paine Webber analyst said the issues were
due to recover from a four-month slump. The S&AMP;P airline index
soared 4.4 percent, as Delta gained 3 11/16, to 51 11/16, UAL 2{,
to 65~ and AMR 1 13/16, to 56 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest positive contributors to the S&AMP;P 500 were Microsoft,
up 1 1316, to 94 1/16, IBM up 4, to 134}, and Intel, up 1 13/16, to
87}.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, up 4 5/16, to 113 15/16, and IBM together
accounted for 42 of the 43 points gained by the Dow blue chip
average.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet stocks also soared. Ebay was up 9 11/16, to 144
7/16, and Yahoo rose 9\, to 162 11/16. Priceline.com, however,
slumped 5 3/32, to 58 5/32, after Microsoft announced a competing
product for hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products slumped 2\, to 40 11/16, as investors
worried about an investigation into what the company told the
government about diet drugs that were pulled from the market in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan skidded 4\, to 77{, while J.P. Morgan and the
Bank of America lost more than a point each in a soft bank and

</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered declining ones on the Big

 &HT;    F-22 makers push for plane at Capitol
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Executives from Lockheed Martin and dozens of its
partners on the F-22 Raptor descended on Capitol Hill on Thursday
in a stepped-up effort to preserve $1.8 billion for the troubled
program.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission: to persuade skeptical members of Congress that
the F-22 is not the money-eating remnant of a Cold War mission that
disappeared with the breakup of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they cast the Raptor as a technological marvel that is
meeting expectations in performance and cost.
</P>
<P>
   Executives with Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Pratt &AMP; Whitney, the
three major contractors on the F-22, used simple, stark language to
rebut criticism of the airplane. They spoke with reporters at a
suburban Virginia hotel following a closed-door briefing for 35 to
40 of their largest suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that the plane is too costly and not needed in the
foreseeable future. They also say that the United States cannot
afford $340 billion to build three different fighter planes the
military wants over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The House cut $1.8 billion for the purchase of six F-22s next
year, endorsing a pause in the program. The Senate included the
money in its version of the defense spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of the truth for the airplane is several weeks away,
at least, said Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.), chairman of the
Appropriations defense subcommittee and leader of the move to cut
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said Thursday he has heard nothing to change his mind and
that the contractors have not done enough testing to answer
``fundamental questions'' about the plane, including whether it
would be as stealthy as its proponents claim.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from the two chambers are expected to meet the last
week of September or the first week of October to try to resolve
differences in their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), an F-22 supporter, said he is
optimistic that Congress will agree to some but not all of the $1.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the F-22's manufacturers touted its prowess.
Recounting conversations with Air Force pilots about aerial warfare
in the coming century, Thomas Farmer, director of Pratt &AMP; Whitney's
engine development for the F-22, said, ``The reason this system is
sought is because those pilots will come home.''
</P>
<P>
   James A. ``Micky'' Blackwell, president and chief operating
officer of Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Sector, said the F-22 would
be able to evade advanced surface-to-air missiles, unlike the
current generation of F-15 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This airplane can go over Baghdad,'' Blackwell said. ``The
F-15 cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   The executives also sought to short-circuit other arguments made
by the F-22's opponents. Canceling the program and speeding up the
development of the Joint Strike Fighter would greatly increase that
airplane's cost since it would absorb some of the F-22's mission,
they said.

NEW QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT APPROVAL OF DIET DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mass., N.J., Pa.) (jw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years after the diet drug Redux was pulled from
pharmacy shelves because of its potential to cause heart-valve
problems, questions are being raised anew about whether its
manufacturer, the American Home Products Corp. of Madison, N.J.,
may have withheld damaging safety information about the drug in an
effort to obtain government approval of it.
</P>
<P>
   At least two lawyers in Texas, both of whom represent plaintiffs
in civil suits against the manufacturer, have been contacted by
agents of the FBI seeking information about the drug-approval
process, one of the lawyers said. Speaking on condition of
anonymity, the lawyer said: ``I think they are looking into whether
or not the approval process was above board. I have some stuff that
they want, some documents.''
</P>
<P>
   The existence of a preliminary inquiry by the FBI was first
reported Thursday in The Wall Street Journal. Quoting an
unidentified federal agent, the newspaper said that since last
month, bureau investigators had been questioning employees of the
Food and Drug Administration who were involved in the agency's 1996
decision to approve Redux, in an effort to determine whether there
is enough evidence to start a formal criminal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both the FBI and the FDA declined to comment on the
report, and officials at American Home Products steadfastly denied
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company acted responsibly and did not withhold anything
from the agency,'' said Douglas Petkus, a spokesman for
Wyeth-Ayerst, the company's pharmaceutical division. ``That's the
bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether American Home hid evidence that its diet
drug might cause heart-valve damage and primary pulmonary
hypertension, a lung disorder, is at the center of thousands of
civil lawsuits, as well as class-action suits in New Jersey and a
federal court in Philadelphia on behalf of healthy patients seeking
money for medical checkups.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's reports only added to the controversy. Marc Farley, a
lawyer for the company, said American Home promptly reported all
information about Redux to the FDA. But plaintiffs' lawyers cited
documents showing that the company knew of 31 cases of heart-valve
damage among Belgian patients taking Pondimin, a close chemical
cousin of Redux. The lawyers said the company knew of more than 100
cases of primary pulmonary hypertension among patients taking
Pondimin, even though the drug's label said there had been only
four cases.
</P>
<P>
   Farley said American Home made the FDA aware of the additional
cases before Redux's approval. But the plaintiffs' lawyers said the
company played down the information about Pondimin because they
were concerned that it would jeopardize the approval of Redux.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole approval process of Redux stinks,'' another Texas
plaintiff's lawyer, Tommy Fibich, said in a telephone interview.
Fibich, who said he had not been contacted by the FBI, settled a
case with American Home in June in which he represented the husband
and young children of Mary Smith, who died of primary pulmonary
hypertension after taking Redux for 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had been candid and up front'' about Pondimin, Fibich
said, ``that would have killed Redux.''
</P>
<P>
   Redux, whose chemical name is dexfenfluoramine, is an improved
version of Pondimin, which had been marketed by American Home
Products since the early 1970s. It was most often prescribed in
combination with another drug, phentermine, in a combination known
popularly as fen-phen. In the 17 months that Redux was on the
market, more than 6 million prescriptions were written for the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the drug by the FDA, however, did not come without a
fight. Redux was discovered by Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. of
Lexington, Mass., which sought approval from the agency to market
it in conjunction with American Home Products. In September 1995,
an advisory panel to the FDA, concerned about evidence that it
caused brain damage in animals, recommended rejecting Redux by a
5-3 vote. Later that year the panel reversed itself and, by a vote
of 6-5, recommended approval, saying the drug's benefits outweighed
its risks for its intended market: people who are clinically obese.
</P>
<P>
   Redux was approved by the FDA in April 1996 and was withdrawn,
along with Pondimin, in September 1997 after reports that patients
were experiencing heart-valve damage. Three months after the
withdrawal, the agency conducted an inspection of American Home
Products to determine how quickly the company had reported these
``adverse drug events.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports are required within 15 days after an event is
documented. A copy of the inspection report, obtained from Public
Citizen's Research Group, an advocacy organization in Washington,
shows that American Home missed the 15-day deadline, by as much as
74 days, on 27 separate occasions with respect to Pondimin and
Redux.
</P>
<P>
   Farley, the company's lawyer, said the FDA took no action _
``not even a warning letter'' _ as a result of the inspection. ``At
the end of it,'' he said, ``they were satisfied that American Home
acted properly.''

WATSON HAPPILY MAKES THE TURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Time marches on.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, who battled Jack Nicklaus for PGA Tour supremacy
from the mid-1970s though the mid-'80s, joins Nicklaus in the
senior-tour ranks today.
</P>
<P>
   How can that be?
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, Watson was basking in the glow of his 34th PGA
Tour victory (eight of those majors), believing he could still play
at that level.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he's renewing old acquaintances and trying to embrace
reality after missing the cut more than half the time in the 13 PGA
Tour events he entered this year before turning 50 last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to pass the baton,'' Watson said at Indianapolis,
where he makes his senior debut today in the Comfort Classic at the
Brickyard. ``But it is hard to let go.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, it will soon be just as hard on the earnings of
Watson's new senior mates.
</P>
<P>
   While some of his predecessors as senior-tour rookies seemed to
enter the 50-over ranks almost reluctantly, Watson joins the no-cut
circuit as mentally ready as he is physically fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching the scores out there,'' he said, ``players
shooting 62s, 63s and 15-under, 17-under for three rounds _ that is
great golf on any course.''
</P>
<P>
   But...
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to come out and compete, and I want to come out and
win.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows he'll miss the excitement of playing against the
world's best players on the PGA Tour, especially since he believes
he can still compete effectively when he has his best game going.
</P>
<P>
   But Watson also knows nothing less than his best will get
winning done on that tour anymore. And he knows his game is now
better suited for the shorter senior-tour courses than the
7,000-yard PGA Tour layouts where greens seem to be getting harder
and less-receptive to long approach shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``These (PGA Tour) courses eat my lunch because I can't compete
with players that hit the ball as high as I used to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson also strides into his golden years appreciative of an
opportunity his professional predecessors never had.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started, there was no senior tour,'' he said.
``There was no talk about a senior tour (let alone no-cut fields
that guarantee checks for every tournament participant from a
season purse that exceeds $49 million this year).
</P>
<P>
   ``When you couldn't play anymore on the regular tour, you went
back and you got a club job someplace. Or you tried to make enough
money where you didn't have to go back and try to earn a living the
way our forefathers did out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson knows his options are considerably better, no matter how
hard it is to let go of that baton.
</P>
<P>
   Junior update: Brandon Christianson, the two-time Toyota Skills
Challenge national finalist and eighth-grader at Valencia's La Mesa
Junior High, has qualified for the Southern California PGA's
Tournament of Champions for a fifth straight year.
</P>
<P>
   The annual December competition is open only to winners of SCPGA
events during that year. Christianson won nine of the 24 SCPGA
events he entered in 1999, competing in age group 12-13.
</P>
<P>
   But he'll play the TOC in age group 14-15, since he turns 14
just before Halloween. It will be a significant step up, since age
14-15 competition will include area U.S. Junior Amateur qualifiers
Brian Edick of Valencia and Anthony Kim of Studio City. Also,
there's San Gabriel Valley standout Henry Liau, who shot
11-under-par 59 for an Alhambra GC record last summer and last
month set an amateur course record of 8-under-par 64 at Moreno
Valley Ranch. ...
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Hoffenberg of Simi Valley, who won seven of his eight
starts in Ventura County Junior Golf Association tournaments this
year, is that county's Player of the Year in age 12-under division.
Hoffenberg, who plays to a handicap index of 10.8 at Wood Ranch,
tied for first in the only tournament he lost, missing on a
card-off....
</P>
<P>
   Section championship: The Southern California PGA will conduct
its 54-hole section championship Monday through Wednesday at
Mission Hills CC in Rancho Mirage, with defending champion and
recent national PGA Club Professional Championship winner Jeff
Freeman of Tamarisk included in a field of 112.
</P>
<P>
   Area entries include Brad Benkey of Saticoy, Robert Dacey
(Tierra Del Sol), Paul Duarte and Markel Taylor (both from El
Caballero), Don Fiala (Wood Ranch), Jon Fiedler (Las Posas), Jack
Garner (Oakmont), Roger Gunn, Paul Holtby and Kristy Park (all
three from Lake Lindero), Ted Lehmann (Westlake Village) and Dustin
Schilling (Chevy Chase).
</P>
<P>
   Greg Frederick of Glendale's Oakmont Country Club had considered
playing but opted not to because of an ailing shoulder that might
need surgery. He'll need to be at full strength next year when he
shoulders the duties of SCPGA president, succeeding Bill Hulbert of
Yorba Linda CC. ...
</P>
<P>
   And the winner is: Alan Ochiai of Tustin Ranch has been named
SCPGA Teacher of the Year for 1999, marking the second time in
three years a Tustin Ranch instructor has been honored.... Dr.
David Wright of Pelican Hill, the 1998 SCPGA Teacher of the Year,
won the Horton Smith Award for his work in furthering the education
of PGA Professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Expo to Fairplex: The SPGA Golf Expo is moving from Long Beach
Convention Center to the Pomona Fairplex next year. The Expo,
scheduled for March 3-5, has been held at the Long Beach Convention
Center the past three years....
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from a decade of Expos helped the SCPGA begin
construction six months ago on the 36-hole PGA of Southern
California Golf Club in Oak Valley, near Calamesa. The two
Schmidt/Curley-designed courses, which will be called Legends and
Champions, should be ready for play next spring. Irrigation systems
are already in place, seeding began this week, ground was recently
broken on the maintenance facility and construction on a 31,000
square-foot clubhouse and SCPGA Section office is scheduled to
begin next month.

15 MORE ACCUSED OF DRUG SMUGGLING AT MIAMI AIRPORT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (jw) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Undercover agents, working to bring down a widespread
drug-smuggling operation at Miami International Airport, thought
that the arrests last month of more than 40 baggage handlers and
food service workers on drug charges might force other suspects at
the airport to be more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after dodging one bullet, the remaining suspects just
assumed they were bulletproof, said federal investigators, who
arrested 15 more people Thursday morning and charged them with
conspiracy to import cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after the headline-grabbing arrests on Aug. 25,
employees of several contract service companies that provide food,
maintenance and baggage handling at the airport were back at work
smuggling what they believed to be cocaine _ it was actually fake
drugs substituted by undercover agents _ aboard Air Aruba, Bahamas
Air and Ecuatoriana flights, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On one flight into Miami International, U.S. Attorney Tom Scott
said, a baggage handler took only 23 minutes after touchdown to
retrieve what he believed to be a package of cocaine and pass it on
to a man waiting at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do any of you get bags in 23 minutes?'' Scott asked reporters
at a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the baggage handler, he handed the parcel over
to an undercover drug agent, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many signs, the investigators said, that their
suspects were long on ambition but short on smarts.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Eaton, special agent with the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said one suspect told undercover agents: ``Look,
don't worry. Everything is business as usual. We're a lot smarter
than those guys. They didn't know how to handle these kinds of
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators could not resist shaking their heads at the
audacity of it.
</P>
<P>
   Even as indictments were being issued in the first round of
arrests, ``they were still smuggling,'' said Pat Jones, a spokesman
for the U.S. Customs Bureau, another agency involved in the sting
operation. It is the second such sting in two weeks that has shown
glaring lapses in the airport's security.
</P>
<P>
   The first sting, on Aug. 25, led to the arrests of 58 people,
including 30 American Airlines workers, 13 employees with the food
contractor LSG/Sky Chefs, a Department of Agriculture inspector, an
employee with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and an
off-duty employee of the Broward County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   They were charged with smuggling what they believed to be small
shipments of heroin, hundreds of pounds of cocaine, a loaded pistol
and three hand grenades, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The workers arrested in August stashed their illegal cargo in
the small packets of coffee served by flight attendants, in wheel
compartments, wall panels, luggage bays and, on one plane, inside
the wing, federal investigators said. Television news crews and
newspaper photographers captured the arrests on video and film, and
the pictures dominated the news in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when federal agents working undercover at the airport asked
other targets of their ongoing investigation if they should lay low
for a while, the suspected smugglers ``repeatedly assured them
there was no problem,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   They went so far as to say they were much better at it than the
American Airlines workers who were arrested, said Vincent Mazzilli,
a special agent with the DEA.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzilli quoted one suspect as saying: ``Those guys, they were
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling operation came to light two years ago when an
American Airlines pilot was accidentally served a mixture of coffee
and heroin from a smuggled parcel and complained that his coffee
tasted funny.
</P>
<P>
   The smugglers used their identification cards to bypass security
at the airport, even on days when they were not scheduled to work,
and were never challenged by airport security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 1 mission is to protect the traveling public from
terrorists' attacks,'' said Lauren Stover, the associate director
of public affairs at Miami International Airport. ``Our job is not
to intercept drugs.''

CHANGES AT MORGAN STANLEY REFLECT EUROPE'S GROWING IMPORTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To judge by a sweeping reshuffling of management at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Europe is king.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has long been a testing ground for senior investment
bankers. But the continent, in the inaugural year of the euro, has
quickly become the deal-making center of the world as American
merger and acquisition activity slows. And for Wall Street, power
follows the money.
</P>
<P>
   At Morgan Stanley, New York-based and London-based bankers will
now share authority over two leading profit centers in investment
banking: mergers and acquisitions, and corporate finance. The firm
named Mike Uva, a London-based banker, to split corporate finance
duties with William Lewis in New York. Simon Robey in London will
share the title of merger and acquisitions chief with Stephen
Munger in New York. The changes were announced in an internal
memorandum circulated to employees Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The most senior banking executives at Morgan Stanley remain in
New York. But the firm's promotions in London signal that key
foreign postings are no longer mere training grounds for top jobs
in the United States. London in particular is becoming a global
administrative center in its own right, a place where Wall Street
bankers can spend most of their careers and accumulate authority
once vested solely in those willing to play politics at corporate
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dramatic statement of how important Europe is
becoming to our business,'' one person close to Morgan Stanley said
of the personnel changes. ``More and more, everything we do will be
cross-border.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley is not alone in recognizing the trend. John
Thornton, who has guided Goldman Sachs Group's international
operation from London for many years, was named co-chief operating
officer and designated an heir apparent of the firm earlier this
year. He remains in London.
</P>
<P>
   Business is moving across the Atlantic. In the highly profitable
mergers advisory business, total volume of deals slipped in the
United States in the first half of this year, to $880 billion from
$945 billion. In Europe, companies in nearly every area, from
telecommunications to basic industry, are rushing to set up
seamless pan-European operations in tandem with the new
continent-wide European currency. The volume of deals there
increased by half over the year-ago period, to $455 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the biggest deals of the year _ the ones generating the
highest fees for bankers _ were in Europe. Olivetti's
headline-grabbing $35 billion purchase of the much larger Telecom
Italia meant big fees for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and Lehman
Brothers, advisers on the two sides. Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs were on opposite sides of the biggest telecommunications deal
of the year, when Vodafone Group of Britain bought America's
Airtouch Communications for $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street firms have also sent top New York bankers and
traders to London to oversee the new business of underwriting bonds
denominated in euros. Long-term, some economists see the euro as
competing with the dollar as the top international currency.
American investment banks have made no secret of their desire to
steal that business away from Europe-based rivals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The promotions of executives in Europe were the centerpiece of
Morgan Stanley's reshuffling. But the changes were surprisingly
broad in scope for a firm that is in the middle of its most
profitable year ever. Though the firm has shown few signs of
weakness in mergers and acquisitions, the appointments mean all new
administrative leadership for that unit. Gary Parr, who had been a
co-leader of mergers and acquisitions, returns to doing client work
full time as head of an expanded banking group catering to banks
and insurance companies, according to the memo.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate finance, the part of the banking business that manages
clients' relationships worldwide, will also have two new leaders.
Lewis, who had been a co-leader of mergers and acquisitions, and
Uva in London replace Robert Jones, a veteran Morgan Stanley
executive who insiders said had withdrawn from administrative
duties but will continue at the firm as a vice chairman and senior
banker.
</P>
<P>
   Both corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions continue to
report to Joseph Perella, the firm's head of investment banking. In
other changes, Michael Zaoui was named head of European mergers and
acquisitions, based in London, and Owen Thomas will become deputy
head of the firm's real estate department.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to Morgan Stanley said the midyear changes
reflected some tensions within the executive suite as well as a
desire to focus more on Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't change so many people at once unless there are
conflicts to be addressed,'' the person said. ``Morgan Stanley has
become a less congenial place to work, frankly, even though no one
can complain about performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The person added that growth in all kinds of banking had
strained the collegial atmosphere that had prevailed at the firm
and had tested the administrative skills of people who were groomed
in serving clients, not managing employees. ``I think they're still
just feeling their way through this by trial and error,'' the
person said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the firm declined to comment on the personnel
changes.

U.S. GENERAL WAS OVERRULED IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The British general in charge of NATO forces in
Kosovo refused to obey an order from NATO's supreme commander, an
American, to block Russian troops after their surprise take-over of
the main airfield there in June, the Pentagon's senior military
commander told Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the two commanders was resolved quickly by
British and U.S. military leaders in favor of the Briton, Gen.
Michael Jackson, over the American, Gen. Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had rejected the order from his superior by saying:
``No, I'm not going to do that. It's not worth starting World War
III.''
</P>
<P>
   That account was given Thursday by Gen. Henry Shelton, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a hearing of the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Although the incident was reported by Newsweek magazine last
month, Shelton is the first senior official to confirm that the
dispute was resolved at the highest levels between the British and
U.S. military commanders, and that it has raised serious doubts
about NATO's chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, said he would hold hearings to determine whether
Jackson's refusal amounted to insubordination, or if it was
permissible under NATO rules, which he would then want to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you run a military operation if the subordinates can
decide they don't want to follow the supreme commander?'' Warner
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said the affair was ``troubling,'' especially during a
military operation, where discipline can be ``a matter of life and
death.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Embassy in Washington said Thursday night that the
government would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   In June, as NATO first entered Kosovo after its bombing campaign
to suppress Serbian forces, Russian troops made a surprise grab for
the airfield outside Pristina, the provincial capital. In this
early tense period, when Russian intentions were unclear, Clark
ordered Jackson to send tanks and armored personnel carriers to
take back the airstrip from the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to move something in on the airfield to ensure
that no one used the airfield to reinforce or to start pouring
in,'' said Shelton. ``And so the first thing the next morning,
General Clark told General Jackson that he would like to move some
armored vehicles up on to the thing _ up on to the airfield.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson refused. After Clark stood his ground, Jackson said
that control of the airfield was not worth starting a world war
with the Russians, and that he would discuss the order with his own
British commander, Gen. Charles Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   This practice, known in NATO parlance as using a red card,
allows a subordinate to ask his own national commander for
permission to disobey a foreign officer who is superior to him in
the NATO chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Shelton was awakened by Guthrie, his British
counterpart, and the two men agreed that taking back the airport
was not worth a split in NATO. Within days Jackson's argument that
the Russians would not be able to upset the NATO operation through
control of the airport proved correct, and the Russians were
eventually brought into the multinational peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   A major factor in resolving the conflict between these two
strong-willed commanders was the varying degree of support each man
won from his military.
</P>
<P>
   The British successfully argued for Jackson's position, while
Shelton essentially allowed Clark's orders to be overruled, said a
Pentagon official.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 10-week air campaign Clark had several
disagreements with the Pentagon (and in fact he is leaving his NATO
command two months early). For example, he had to push to overcome
the Army's resistance to his request for Apache helicopters. While
the helicopters were eventually sent to Albania, they were never
used in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no question of a difference of view and that Clark
wanted to confront the Russians and the British didn't,'' said an
administration official involved in the dispute. ``Jackson thought
we Americans were blowing out of proportion the importance of the
airfield, and he wasn't willing to risk soldiers' lives for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of the dispute, during NATO's first war, remains
unclear, Pentagon officials agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, this had been theory only,'' said a Pentagon official.
``If in fact, this is permissible in the gentlemen's club of NATO,
then it's something we have to look at and we may have to rethink
these niceties.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the official said, the United States would be
reluctant to give up exactly the discretion exercised by Jackson:
the ability to question orders from foreign commanders that would
put U.S. soldiers in harm's way.

MOST PBS DONOR LISTS SHARED WITH DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The controversy over the direct-mail fund-raising
practices of public broadcasting stations was thrust back into the
spotlight Thursday, as the president of the Public Broadcasting
Service resigned and an inspector general's report concluded that
stations had officially shared donor lists almost entirely with
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   When the practice of list-swapping was first disclosed earlier
this year, many station officials claimed the effort was
bipartisan, with lists being shared with both political parties to
find new donors.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, some stations did share their donors' names with
groups that sounded like Republican organizations, according to an
investigation by the inspector general of the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting. But the investigator found the vast majority
of those groups were not connected to the Republican Party, and it
now appears the Democratic Party was mostly involved, the
investigator found.
</P>
<P>
   The report was released as the president of the Public
Broadcasting Service, Ervin S. Duggan, resigned after five years in
the post. Although PBS officials said the move was unrelated to the
list-swapping scandal, at least one House Republican accused the
organization of trying to use Duggan as a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Representative W.J. ``Billy''
Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the House committee
that oversees funding for Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
said, ``The inference is that he is being forced to walk the plank
for the donor list scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also said, ``If they're going to force someone to walk
the plank, they should start with station management at WGBH,'' the
Boston public television station that has been at the center of the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Epstein, a spokesman for PBS, said there was
``absolutely no connection'' between the timing of Duggan's
announcement and the release of the report. Epstein said the
31-page report does not even mention PBS, but focuses instead on
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the umbrella organization
that receives congressional funding and issues grants to public
television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Duggan, who plans to leave his post Oct. 31, did not mention the
fund-raising controversy, but said: ``A strategy to create greater
financial security and enduring value for PBS and its member
stations is now in place. I have relished serving as a public
champion of PBS's unique mission of education, culture and
citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   After the report was released Thursday, WGBH President Henry
Becton said he welcomed the inspector general's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``His review underscores that there were only two incidents of
WGBH sharing a portion of our donors' names with a political
organization. It was not an ongoing activity,'' Becton said.
``These two incidents violated our own policy against such
releases, and I accept responsibility, along with the senior
managers who oversee this aspect of our operation, for these
errors. Effective immediately we are putting in place a revised
donor mailing list policy and establishing new approval and
compliance systems to strengthen oversight of all list-related
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The list-swapping dispute began in May, when a contributor to
WGBH received a solicitation from the Democratic Party. Immediately
realizing her young son's name had been passed from the station to
the political organization, the donor contacted the Globe, which
published an article about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   In July, however, just as the House telecommunications
subcommittee was about to begin debate over funding for public
broadcasting, two disclosures emerged: that WGBH had swapped its
lists with the Democratic Party more often that it initially
admitted and that the list-swapping practice was going on at public
television stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House panel immediately stopped the funding
debate and held a hearing about the mailing practices, repeating
their longtime charge that public broadcasting is influenced by
liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, with the release of the report, the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting appeared open to that accusation once again.
Kenneth A. Konz, the inspector general who assessed the involvement
of the nation's 183 public TV stations and 408 radio stations,
found that 53 of the stations _ or 9 percent of the total _ made
their donor lists available to political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all of the exchange or rental transactions of
station membership/donor names were to apparently Democratic
organizations,'' Konz wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He did not identiy any Republican organizations, but did mention
``Dole Donors`` a list of contributiors to the 1996 Dole campaign
owned by Bob Dole Enterprises Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Konz said some groups involved in the list-swapping appeared to
be connected to the Republican Party, such as the ``Country Club
Republicans'' or one called ``Pataki,'' the name of the governor of
New York. But neither of those lists was connected to the
Republican Party, Konz found. They were lists of donors compiled by
so-called list brokers, based on information from public campaign
fund-raising records.
</P>
<P>
   ``While many of the names acquired by the public broadcasters
came from lists which had political-sounding names, they were not
in fact owned or compiled by political organizations,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to WGBH-TV, other New England stations that
participated in the practic included Connecticut Network
Television; New Hampshire Public Television; WKPT-FM Radio in
Meriden, Conn.; WMEH-FM Radio in Bangor, Maine; WMEA-FM Radio in
Portland, Maine; and WGBH-FM Radio in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other stations, including radio stations WBUR-FM and
WUMB in Boston, and WSBE-TV in Providence, R.I. did not make their
donor lists available to political groups.
</P>
<P>
   The report also spelled out its findings at WGBH, which Konz
visited during his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, WGBH records show it released a total
of 32,000 names to political groups, only 0.3 percent of the names
on the station's donor lists, the report said. That was the result
of two transactions, according to station officials who said both
incidents were a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report concluded that WGBH in fact turned down
a request for a name-swap from the Democratic National Committee in
1996 and 1998.

   WASHINGTON _ With the smog season winding down in the East,
preliminary figures from the Environmental Protection Agency show
that air quality this summer for Eastern cities has been among the
worst in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not worst on record, but far from what it should be to
assure the public's health,'' said EPA Administrator Carol Browner.
</P>
<P>
   For example, New York City has recorded 14 days so far this year
when the prime ingredient of smog, ozone, was above a federal
threshhold of 120 parts per billion for an hour. That compares with
7 days in 1998. The high for New York was 43 days in 1988, a record
year for most Eastern cities. But other recent years have been
worse than 1999; there were 18 ``exceedances,'' or days above the
federal threshhold, in 1995 and again in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Smog levels in the 1990s are generally down from the 1980s
because government regulations have forced industries and
automakers to adhere to stricter emissions standards. However, the
regulations have not been enough to eliminate violations, officials
said, especially with more drivers using more gasoline and with
utilities burning more fuels such as coal.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has recorded seven days over 120 parts per billion,
the most since 1993; Baltimore and Philadelphia also had a year
that ranked among the highest of the 1990s. Additional warm weather
could add a day or two to each city.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Few Western cities have reported data yet. An exception is Los
Angeles, which was doing well. With about half of its ozone season
passed, Los Angeles has recorded 26 days with concentrations above
120 parts per billion, and probably will accrue about 52 days for
the year, according to agency officials, down from 62 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The weather in Los Angeles varies less from year to year than in
the East, EPA officials said, and a reduction in exceedances
indicates that control measures on tailpipes, smokestacks and other
sources are working.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One EPA official called the situation this summer, which began
with extended hot, sunny weather of the kind that creates ozone,
``a bad year but not a hideous year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner, whose agency has been frustrated by court decisions
setting aside stricter standards that it has been trying to impose,
said the numbers in the East ``are not in line with some of the
really bad years of the '80s, but this is 1999, and we can do
better.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, the EPA plans to finalize stricter
standards on vehicles, which will begin taking effect in 2004, and
it is considering petitions from several Eastern states to order
the cleanups of specific industrial plants in the Midwest because
emissions from those plants are drifting East and are contributing
to the smog problem.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the EPA is challenging a decision in May by the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that
ordered the EPA to reconsider a stricter ozone standard that it was
phasing in to replace the 120 parts per billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Long-time combatants on clean air policy are drawing differing
interpretations from the preliminary data.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not been the best year, but not been as bad as some
people feared,'' said Keith Holman, chief regulatory counsel at the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The last set of control measures was passed by Congress in 1990
and is still being phased in, Holman said. ``We need to have a
little more time to see how the 1990 control measures are really
going to pan out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber filed a brief with the appeals court on what turned
out to be the winning side, against the new, stricter ozone
standard, leaving the the agency to fall back on the old, 120 parts
per billion standard.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of stricter controls say that if the new standards
were in force, which set an eight-hour average of 80 parts per
billion rather than a one-hour average of 120 parts, the number of
exceedances would almost triple.
</P>
<P>
   But Jason Grumet, the executive director at the Northeast States
for Coordinated Air Use Management, an organization made up of the
six New England states, New York and New Jersey, said the data
showed that ``we're doing a fair-to-middling job.''
</P>
<P>
   Measures already taken have clearly reduced the number of
exceedances under the old standard, Grumet said.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``The bad news is that tens of millions of people continue
to be exposed to air pollution concentrations that violate the old
standard, which we know to be under-protective,'' he said, ``And
many more experience dozens of days each summer that violate the
new standards, which we anticipate will be back in effect in a few
months.''

U.S. REPORT DETAILS WORLD'S RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the number of freely elected governments
continues to grow throughout the world, there are still many
countries in which people face harassment, imprisonment or even
death for practicing their religions, a State Department report
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The department's first annual Report on International Religious
Freedom cited Afghanistan, China, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia
and Sudan as among the most repressive countries. The report,
filling more than 1,000 pages, covers 194 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something very important that we cannot afford to lose
in the pages of such a large report,'' said Robert Seiple, the
department's ambassador at large for international religious
freedom, speaking at a news briefing. ``It is the fate of millions
of people throughout the world who are suffering because of their
religious faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The persecution cited Thursday has been widely reported before,
though perhaps not in such detail. But the document is significant
in that it is the first such annual report required under the
International Religious Freedom Act, passed by Congress last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The report is meant to guide the federal government in shaping
policy toward other countries. The worst offenders on religious
freedom, those that engage in systematic and egregious violations
like torture or imprisonment, may be subject to severe economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The findings detailed Thursday by Seiple include persecution and
killings by Afghanistan's Taliban movement; China's continuing
intolerance of unregistered religious activity and punishment by
imprisonment and labor camps; Cuba's scrutiny and harassment of
many religious activities, its national constitution
notwithstanding; Saudi Arabia's detention of members of a minority
Islamic branch, and Sudanese persecution of Christians and Muslims
in connection with a civil war.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who left Thursday for the Asian economic
summit meeting in New Zealand, said he would study the report on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   The report was largely based on research by American government
employees around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Tacitly recognizing that the criticism is not enough in itself
to change the behavior of foreign governments, Seiple said the
report would nonetheless ``signal unambiguously to persecutor and
persecuted alike that they would not be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Seiple said that American efforts to effect change in other
countries could begin with constructive, diplomatic criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suffering has a face,'' Seiple said. ``In my office, there's a
lovely watercolor painting of a house and a garden.'' The painting,
he said, was done by a young Lebanese woman named Mary, who fled
her village as it was being overrun by militiamen. One caught her
and demanded that she repudiate her faith. She refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullet that was fired went in just to the left of her chin
and severed her spinal cord,'' Seiple said. Now, she paints with a
brush braced in her right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the world there are many Marys,'' he said.

   CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ One of the most frequently mentioned
factoids in Bill Bradley's presidential campaign is that when he
was growing up, his hometown had only one stoplight. This is an
excellent example of a modern American political phenomenon. Sooner
or later, almost every candidate feels the need to demonstrate that
he hails from someplace really, really obscure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a small-town boy. I had a paper route,'' bragged the
former New Jersey senator Wednesday, as he stood in front of his
old high school and officially announced that he was absolutely,
for sure, running for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Al Gore (Carthage, Tenn.) and George W. Bush (Midland,
Texas), Bill Bradley cannot be accused of simply laying claim to
the humblest community in which he ever laid his head. Even though
he left at 18, he definitely did grow up in Crystal City
(population 4,088). Over his long absence, the town has acquired
four more stoplights and access to every fast-food brand name on
the planet. But its old oaks and simple virtues have taken on an
almost mythic quality in the Bradley oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   This week his former neighbors made their bid for the pantheon
of teeny-tiny presidential breeding grounds, to be the next Plains,
Ga., or Town Called Hope. Everybody from his second-grade music
teacher to his Little League catcher turned up to say a few words
in testimonial, and the local homemakers baked what were reliably
estimated to be 5,000 cookies for the reception. The candidate,
conducting reporters on a tour of his old childhood haunts, seemed
absolutely ebullient _ at least by Bill Bradley standards. (``All
right, well, this is the church.'')
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole _ whose slogan should have been ``Elect Him, He's
Suffered Enough'' _ brought reporters to Russell, Kan., so they
could visit the sites of his childhood misery: the basement where
his family lived while rich renters lounged around upstairs, the
gym where the big basketball game was called off due to dust
storms. George W. Bush embraces Midland to mute the image of
himself as a child of privilege. (Bush's campaign has gone so
swimmingly, however, that he did not feel compelled to drag
everybody out to West Texas so he could announce his candidacy in
front of his old grade school.) Bill Clinton used downscale Hope,
Ark., to take the curse off his Rhodes Scholar image.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has an even more golden career to live down, and his
return to Crystal City was partially an attempt to remind voters
that although he is indeed a former Rhodes Scholar, Olympic
champion, world-famous basketball player and U.S. senator, his
roots lie in a town at least as humble as their own, and with fewer
traffic signals.
</P>
<P>
   In olden days, the media were not much interested in examining a
candidate's roots, and they were not invited to try until the
nomination, at least, was sewn up. In 1920, residents of Marion,
Ohio, celebrated the Republican Party's choice of Warren Harding
with a parade, during which they casually informed reporters that
the local department store was not decorated for the occasion
because the owner had just found out that Harding had been having a
long-running affair with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely nothing that fascinating happened in Crystal City
this week. In fact, the Bill Bradley his former neighbors described
was a terrifyingly virtuous young man _ polite to his elders,
generous to his friends, hard-working, humble and, as the
second-grade music teacher assured the crowd, ``an outstanding
performer in rhythmic activities.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of thing is pretty much par for the course when it
comes to recounts of Early Bradley. In college he was described by
a New Yorker writer as having dramatically increased ``the
undergraduate body's tolerance for people with high ethical
standards.'' He was reported to have prepared for athletic
competitions by listening to repeated renditions of ``Climb Every
Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no Bill Bradley anecdotes to compare to the one about
the time George W. Bush got drunk and ran over the neighbors'
garbage cans, or the childhood temper tantrums that forced John
McCain's parents to toss him in a tub of ice water. We have a
peculiar situation this campaign season _ the Republicans have the
wild boys and the Democrats have the perfect little gentlemen.
Bradley is trying to position himself as the Democratic
anti-Clinton. This week, at least, he managed to make even Al Gore
sound like a former juvenile delinquent.

BOTH CHINA AND U.S. BOTH UPBEAT ABOUT TALKS ON TRADE GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Overcoming a serious obstacle in their
soured relationship, the United States and China agreed Friday to
resume negotiations on China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, and both sides expressed hopes that China would join
in less than three months.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Chinese
Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng announced the resumption
after a discussion here at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum.
</P>
<P>
   Their agreement sets a positive tone for the meeting here
Saturday between President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin. The Clinton administration hopes the meeting will restore
some steadiness to the relationship between the two countries after
a many months of acrimony over the accidental bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and charges that China
stole U.S. nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky did not release a precise schedule but said that
``substantive discussions'' between Chinese and U.S. trade
officials on the outstanding issues would begin and that it was
unlikely that the deal would be completed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Shi characterized his talks with Ms. Barshefsky as
``very constructive.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``We are willing to work together to conclude
negotiations at an early date and bring China into WTO at an early
date.''
</P>
<P>
   China's membership in the WTO, which would give U.S. businesses
and agricultural producers wide access to the Chinese market, has
been a major goal of the Clinton administration's China policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's decision in April to turn down an offer by the
Chinese and the refusal of the Chinese to come back to the table
derailed the progress that had been made in rounds of intense
negotiations earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky said that the two sides would pick up the
negotiations where they broke off. She described the main issues as
banking, textiles and anti-dumping measures and suggested that the
United States wanted the Chinese to agree to the demands Clinton
made in April.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes for getting China membership in the entity that
governs world trade are now high because a failure to reach an
agreement before the start of the next round of the WTO's talks, in
Seattle beginning in late November, would place even more stress on
the Washington-Beijing relationship.
</P>
<P>
   China's efforts to join the WTO, and its predecessor, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, have lasted 13 years. Only
under Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, a reformist, have the talks made
serious progress. As China's economy has faltered and as it tries
to shut down or shrink inefficient state-run industries, Zhu has
been anxious to attract foreign investment and competition.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will not need to vote on a final deal, but in order for
China to take full part in the Seattle trade talks and for American
businesses to get the full advantage of China's membership,
Congress must pass legislation allowing China permanent normal
trading relations with the United States, officials said. At the
moment, China is subject to annual congressional renewal of its
trade status.
</P>
<P>
   In the document that was nearly completed in April, China made
far-ranging concessions to liberalize its economy, including
opening up telecommunications, financial services and agriculture.

CLINTON WARNS INDONESIA OVER EAST TIMOR VIOLENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton declared Thursday that Indonesia
``must invite'' an international force to quell violence in East
Timor if the Jakarta regime cannot end a rampage by opponents of
independence for the breakaway province.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton failed to spell out a U.S. course if the Indonesian
government persists in rejecting outside intervention, but he
ordered the largely symbolic step of cutting off U.S. military
contacts with Indonesia and threatened biting economic reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted ``very dire'' fiscal consequences if the government
of President B.J. Habibie allowed the mayhem to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the financial institutions are not moving forward
with substantial new lending to Indonesia,'' Clinton said. ``My own
willingness to support future assistance will depend very strongly
on the way Indonesia handles this situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a pity if the Indonesian (economic) recovery were
crashed by this. But one way or the other, it will be crashed by
this if they don't fix it. Nobody is going to want to continue to
invest there if they're allowing this sort of travesty to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Indonesian authorities ``either can't or won't
stop the violence, which is leading people to leave; but they don't
want to admit they can't, so they don't want to ask anybody else to
come in.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what recourse Washington and its allies had if
Jakarta would not back down, Clinton made his exasperation plain,
saying: ``I don't have a clear answer for you yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie told a delegation of ambassadors from U.N. Security
Council nations visiting Jakarta that his government ``would get
the situation under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there was little evidence of that beginning to occur,
Fred Eckhard, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said
``there's a more credible basis for giving the Indonesians a bit
more time to get the situation under control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why bring in international troops if the Indonesians can do
the job? The question is: Will they?' '' Eckhard said in New York.
``We were beginning to see some improvements, so let's give them
more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments at the White House came hours before he
departed Thursday night for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
conference this weekend in New Zealand. The deteriorating situation
in East Timor will be a major issue at the group's seventh annual
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in East Timor _ a largely Roman Catholic enclave that was
annexed in 1975 by Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic
nation _ backed independence by 78.5 percent in an Aug 30
referendum. The vote, whose results were officially announced
Sunday, sparked a wave of violence, including looting, arson and
murder, led by militiamen. On Thursday, the Vatican accused the
militiamen of targeting nuns and priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are forces who want to reverse the popular will,''
Clinton said. ``At stake are the lives and way of life of innocent
people. At issue is whether the democratically expressed will of
the people can be overturned by violence and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Indonesia does not end the violence, it must invite _ it
must invite _ the international community to assist in restoring
security. It must move forward in the transition to independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having allowed the vote and gotten such a clear, unambiguous
answer, we cannot have a reversal of course here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had telephoned national leaders around the world
to consult on East Timor and praised the leading role being taken
by Australia, which he called ``the nearest military authority'' to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen ruled out Wednesday the use
of U.S. troops in East Timor, saying: ``The United States cannot
be, and should not be viewed as, the policeman of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said ``no final decisions'' had been made about a U.S.
role in an international force. ``We're consulting with Congress
now on the best way to support this mission, if it goes forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue, however, may be moot as long as Indonesia rejects
outside intervention in East Timor.

PBS PRESIDENT RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparently weary of the tugs of war inherent in his job, Ervin
S. Duggan resigned Thursday as president of the Public Broadcasting
Service, saying that after raising revenue and achieving other
major goals, he wanted to tackle new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   PBS executives and board members said that Duggan had not been
pushed out, but some said the decision might have been mutual
between him and the board, because of assorted frictions with major
PBS stations that had made his tenure increasingly uncomfortable
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this friction arose from Duggan's success at achieving
one of his major goals: raising revenue despite decreasing federal
financing and giving PBS a more secure financial footing. In his 5{
years as president, PBS's revenue grew 70 percent, to a projected
$309 million for the fiscal year 2000, but some of that growth has
come at the expense of larger stations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the money that a station like Thirteen/WNET in New
York could raise by selling videos of programs it produced has been
undercut by PBS's national sales of home-video and other
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Under Duggan, PBS has begun ambitious digital television
initiatives, the PBS Online Web site, extensive services for
teachers and parents, and unified corporate fund-raising efforts
that now attract more than $100 million in underwriting annually
and partnerships to raise additional revenue. About 16 percent of
PBS's revenue in 2000 will come from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Duggan declined to answer questions about his resignation after
issuing a statement, which said he would stay on until Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Colin G. Campbell, the president of the Rockefeller Brothers
Fund who is chairman of PBS's board, said he and Duggan, whose
salary is $151,800, had been discussing the move for months.
Campbell said that John Swope, a board member and the former
chairman of New Hampshire Public Television, would serve as interim
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Not a factor in the resignation, all sides agreed, was the
political furor this summer over news that some PBS stations had
exchanged lists of potential donor with Democratic and Republican
fund-raising groups. Indeed, station executives widely praised
Duggan's eloquence before Congress in defending public television
while condemning those stations' indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the Inspector General's office of the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the entity responsible for
relaying public funds to public broadcasters, issued its report
Thursday on the fund-raising list exchanges. It found 9 percent of
stations had done so, but for financial rather than partisan
political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   PBS is perceived as a network, but actually is the national
programming provider for the country's 349 PBS stations (run by 171
license-holders), which own and operate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being president of PBS is like being president of a
university,'' said Steven M. Bass, president of WDCN, the

<P>
   Ken Burns, the documentarian whose films are synonymous with
PBS, likened Duggan's job to a different sort of presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jefferson Davis,'' Burns said. ``PBS is a confederacy, run
from the bottom up. It's a thankless task to run it. He's both the
servant of these diverse station interests, and as an executive,
duty-bound to give them some structure and discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Duggan helped get stations to synchronize their prime-time
scheduling and to promote the PBS name as well as their own station
names in identifying and presenting programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five months, PBS has lost its top programming
executive, Kathy Quattrone; its chief operating officer, Bob
Ottenhoff, and now Duggan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty tough job and Ervin has done a very good job,''
said William F. Baker, president of Thirteen/WNET. ``But I also
think there will be some outstanding candidates within the system
who will step in.''

ITALY'S PRADA TO BUY BRITISH SHOE MAKER, CHURCH &AMP; CO., OR $170
MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Fusing designer chic and strait-laced tradition, Prada
SpA, the fast-expanding Italian fashion house, said Thursday that
it had agreed to buy Church &AMP; Co. PLC, a 126-year-old British
shoemaker, for 106 million pounds, or $170 million, in cash.
</P>
<P>
   A battle could be looming between Prada and another high-ticket
Italian shoemaker, Diego Della Valle, for Church, which is known
for supplying fine footwear to the literally well heeled. Prada's
bid of 950 pence a share is supported by holders controlling 33
percent of the company, but it could be challenged by Diego Della
Valle, which makes J.P. Tods and Hogans loafers, shoes and bags.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Diego Della Valle increased its stake in Church to
8.6 percent from 6.3 percent, compared with 8.5 percent for Prada,
and the two companies were seen as rival suitors. Prada's offer
represents a 20 percent premium to Church's share price of 790
pence before the company announced last week that it was in talks
with a potential buyer, which it did not identify.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Church dropped 32.5 pence, to 960, still above the
offer price, when investors saw no immediate sign of a counteroffer
from Diego Della Valle. Della Valle, the owner of the company that
bears his name, did not respond to a request for comment. He said
earlier that he was interested in Church, which is based in the
Northampton, but ``not at any price.''
</P>
<P>
   Church's directors have formally accepted the Prada offer and
said they would urge shareholders to accept it. But under the terms
of the deal, Church is free to accept a rival offer if it tops
Prada's bid by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although its price is minuscule by the standards of modern
mergers, the deal reflects the cachet and fascination of luxury
items in an era when booming stock markets and incomes have
broadened a pool of big-spending consumers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``In the last few years, with some exceptions, the market has
been growing very fast because of stock market growth and earnings
growth,'' said Davide Vimercati, an analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a distinctive kind of growth because, by and large,
manufacturers of luxury shoes, clothes, watches, handbags and
accessories fear they will dilute brands based on high price and
exclusivity if they expand them too far or too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies that have critical mass generate a lot of free cash,
so it's natural that they would look for external growth,'' said
Cedric Magnelia, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
Prada's bid for Church comes after recent purchases of the fashion
designers Jil Sander AG in Germany and Helmut Lang in New York. The
acquisitions show that the company, based in Milan, is squaring off
with rivals like Gucci Group NV and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA in a contest to gather smaller luxury brands together
under one, glittering roof.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci, Italy's biggest, publicly traded fashion company, did not
comment today on a newspaper report that it had offered $711
million for its domestic rival, Fendi SpA.
</P>
<P>
   Prada and Diego Della Valle have markedly different market
profiles. While Prada cultivates a fashion-setting image, Diego
Della Valle is viewed as offering a more traditional range of
loafers at about $200 a pair and other shoes and boots for about
$260. Both hail, though, from a culture that, in its quest for
``bella figura'' _ an exquisite appearance at all times _ reveres
shoes in general and has particular regard for high-quality,
conservative-looking English shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Church, whose classic brogues and Oxford shoes sell in England
for upward of $320 a pair, is also seen as having a following among
the business-and-banking set in the United States. Among its 155
outlets, Church has stores in Italy, the United States, France,
Belgium, Hong Kong and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Prada chief executive Patrizio Bertelli indicated he was buying
the mystique of a British brand. ``Should our offer be successful,
it is my firm intention to maintain and possibly strengthen the
British identity of Church by preserving and developing its
industrial presence in Northampton and by enhancing the role of the
management team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, analysts said, Church has lost some of its
luster as a luxury brand, partly because it has lagged rival
shoemakers in marketing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company like Prada knows how to revitalize the brand to give
Church back the image of luxury and exclusivity,'' said Vimercati
at Salomon Smith Barney.

GUCCI SHARES RISE ON REPORTS IT WILL BUY FENDI  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Germany, The Netherlands, France, Texas)   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares in Gucci Group, the Italian luxury goods maker, rose
Thursday on renewed reports that it was about to acquire a domestic
rival, Fendi SpA, for $710 million. People close to the matter said
an announcement could be made as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci's share price rose by as much as 3.3 percent after a
weekly Italian business magazine, Il Mondo, reported that Gucci's
chairman, Domenico De Sole, had persuaded two of the five Fendi
sisters, who own equal shares of Fendi, to sell the company to
Gucci. The report is scheduled to appear Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci shares have risen by about 15 percent since late July,
when the first news reports of Gucci's interest in Fendi surfaced.
On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Gucci rose $1.375
Thursday, or 1.6 percent, to $85.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Tommaso Galli, Gucci's spokesman in Milan, called the report
``one of numerous rumors about the company'' and said Gucci would
not comment. Fendi refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian report said De Sole had persuaded Carla Fendi, the
company's president, and Anna Fendi to accept the Gucci offer. It
said another sister, Franca Fendi, preferred a competing bid by
Texas Pacific Group of Fort Worth, Texas, while Alda and Paola
Fendi were leaning toward Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci is expected to report its quarterly earnings in the coming
week, and one person close to the negotiations said a decision
could be announced at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci's move, if successful, would be the latest step in a
mounting consolidation of the European fashion and luxury goods
industry, especially in Italy, with its relatively small but
creatively vigorous family-owned businesses like Fendi.
</P>
<P>
   Prada, another Italian fashion house with a multibrand strategy
similar to Gucci's, recently announced that it was acquiring
control of the German fashion leader Jil Sander. Thursday, Prada
said it was offering $170 million to acquire Church &AMP; Co. PLC, the
British maker of high-quality shoes.
</P>
<P>
   For Gucci, which is incorporated in the Netherlands but does
most of its manufacturing in Italy, it would be the next step in De
Sole's declared strategy of transforming itself into a multibrand
luxury goods conglomerate to challenge its main European rival,
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton in France.
</P>
<P>
   Fendi has experienced a revival in recent years, largely on the
success of its new Baguette bags, the hottest fashion item of the
moment and the design product of Silvia Venturini, the 39-year-old
head of accessories at Fendi and the daughter of Anna Fendi.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the acquisition-minded chairman of LVMH,
Bernard Arnault, has also expressed interest in Fendi, and if Gucci
succeeded in bringing Fendi into its fold, it would be De Sole's
second victory over Arnault this year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Gucci successfully resisted a hostile
takeover attempt by Arnault, who had built up a sizable stake in
Gucci and who holds 20 percent of Gucci's shares.
</P>
<P>
   To thwart Arnault's bid, De Sole agreed to sell a large stake in
Gucci for $3 billion to Francois Pinault, the French billionaire.
As part of the deal, Gucci said it would consider acquiring Sanofi
Beaute, the cosmetics and fashion division of Sanofi SA that owns
the Yves Saint Laurent name. Pinault bought the business earlier
this year for $1 billion with an eye to incorporating it into
Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Since receiving the $3 billion from Pinault, who controls the
French Pinault-Printemps-Redoute department store group and the
Christie's auction house, Gucci executives have looked at several
offers involving possible fashion industry takeovers. But priority
has been given to completing due diligence at Sanofi Beaute, which
De Sole has said he expects to be completed by the end of this
month so that the takeover can move ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Pacific has been on a recent shopping spree in Europe.
Before announcing a takeover of Bally, the Swiss shoe retailer,
late last month, the investor group announced it was acquiring
Piaggio Veicoli Europei, the Italian maker of motor scooters.

RELIGIOUS LEADERS ASK CLINTON TO FUND MORE HOUSING VOUCHERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An unusually broad group of religious leaders _ Roman Catholics,
Protestants, Jews, Buddhists and Muslims _ has signed a letter to
President Clinton, declaring that access to housing is a ``sacred
right,'' and asking the government to take specific measures to
help the poor obtain permanent shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, sent and released Thursday, faults the government
for having reduced the number of vouchers it provides for
subsidized housing to about 90,000 last year from 230,000 a year in
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It asks the government to provide money for at least 200,000
vouchers in the fiscal year 2000, which begins on Oct. 1, and to
spend $100 million to ``preserve the country's existing affordable
housing supply.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was circulated among religious leaders by two San
Francisco organizations, Housing America, an advocate of federal
spending for lower-cost housing, and Religious Witness with
Homeless People, which seeks housing for the homeless. More than
300 people signed the letter, among them several Catholic bishops,
the leaders of Jewish organizations, Protestant church officials,
and prominent Buddhists, Muslims and Unitarian-Universalists.
</P>
<P>
   One signer, Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza, president of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, said in an interview, ``I think
that the human person is born with certain rights: the right to
life, of course, the first; the right to education; the right to
decent health care, and the right to housing falls right in line
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It works against good family life when you live in poor,
dilapidated quarters,'' said Fiorenza, whose Galveston-Houston
Diocese has worked with a Baptist congregation in Houston to
renovate apartments there for poor people. ``If you don't have good
housing, you're not going to have good health.''
</P>
<P>
   Another signer, Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Union of
American Hebrew Congregations, Reform Judaism's synagogue
organization, said he was struck that the appeal was made on the
eve of the Jewish High Holy Days, which begin Friday at sundown
with Rosh Hashana. The period of repentance and reflection
culminates on Sept. 20 with Yom Kippur, when one biblical passage
read in synagogues worldwide is Isaiah 58, in which God speaks of
ritual fasting: ``Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,
and bring the homeless poor into your house?''
</P>
<P>
   Yoffie said, ``Surely there could be no more vivid reminder of
the need to provide at least adequate housing, at least decent
housing, for those whose needs we are absolutely obligated to
fulfill.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was also signed by Bishop Richard F. Grein of New
York, an Episcopalian. Although Grein was traveling and unavailable
for comment, another diocesan official, Archdeacon Michael Kendall,
said concern among religious groups about affordable housing was
growing nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Housing, Kendall said, is ``not a privilege to be earned _ we're
talking about having people have the essentials of life.''

HELMET LANG DISCLOSES HE HAS SOLD 51 PERCENT STAKE TO PRADA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Austria, Italy, Germany, Britain, Calif.)   By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Helmut Lang, the Austrian fashion designer who moved his
business to New York two years ago, has sold 51 percent of his
company to Prada of Milan. Although the sale was reported in March,
neither Lang nor Patrizio Bertelli, Prada's chief executive,
disclosed details until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lang, whose clothes have been widely copied since he came to
international prominence in the mid-1980s, said on Tuesday that
Prada's investment would allow his company, which had revenue last
year of about $100 million, to grow further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means I will have a partner who is responsible for
marketing, distribution and production,'' he said. ``Bertelli knows
every detail of this business, but more important, he understands
the culture of what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   With the recent acquisition of a 75 percent stake in Jil Sander,
the German fashion company, Bertelli, who is married to the
designer Miuccia Prada, now controls three distinctive brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helmut Lang needed to be shouldered by a holding company like
ours,'' Bertelli said in response to written questions. He added
that Lang would retain creative control over design and
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Lang's revenue comes from clothing sales, the designer
said, but this is likely to change with the introduction this year
of shoes and handbags, which Prada will make. There is also a plan
to open Lang stores in Los Angeles, Berlin and London and to
introduce a Lang perfume.

U.N. GIVES INDONESIA A TROOP REPRIEVE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Indonesia got at least another day's reprieve
Thursday as the secretary general and the Security Council relaxed
an informal deadline for action on troops after receiving reports
that the situation in East Timor had begun to improve slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council was told that Indonesian authorities would
let the United Nations send a relief team to West Timor, an
extremely poor province now sheltering tens of thousands driven
from East Timor without food or protection. The Red Cross will also
be allowed back into East Timor, which has been ravaged by violence
for a week.
</P>
<P>
   But Security Council members, bound by their governments'
unwillingness to go beyond the wishes of Indonesia, once again
pressed its leaders to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Rights organizations and aid agencies increasingly fear that if
and when order returns to East Timor, the extent of destruction
caused by the militias will surpass predictions. Another concern is
that Indonesian troops _ not all willing to obey Indonesia's army
chief, Gen. Wiranto _ may resume attacks on foreigners assessing
the damage as well on as Timorese who try to return.

GENE FEDERICO, GRAPHIC DESIGNER AND AD AGENCY FOUNDER, DIES AT 81  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J.)   By STEVEN HELLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene Federico, a graphic designer and advertising executive who
helped introduce a style of typography to American advertising that
made the lettering the star, rather than a supporting player, died
on Wednesday at his home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   He died after an extended battle with prostate cancer, his wife,
Helen, said.
</P>
<P>
   Federico was a founder in 1967 of Lord, Geller, Federico,
Einstein Inc., a New York advertising agency, and later served as
its creative director, vice president and vice chairman. He was
known for the innovative integration of type and image, using text
as part of the picture to create visual puns. This was the hallmark
of American advertising's ``Creative Revolution'' of the late '50's
and '60's.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '30's, when Federico was first a student in the
extracurricular graphics group known as the Art Squad at Abraham
Lincoln High School and then a member of the 1939 graduating class
at Pratt Institute, both in Brooklyn, clever typographic design was
rare in mass advertising.
</P>
<P>
   At most agencies, copywriters dominated the creative side, with
text segregated from images in unimaginative, cookie-cutter
layouts. The art director was a mere functionary. In Europe,
commercial artists' posters of the same period were strikingly
artful and decidedly individual, but in America, where slogans
reigned supreme, art was an afterthought, and artists' and
designers' names were rarely on agency shingles.
</P>
<P>
   Federico, however, was influenced by the European leaders, among
them A.M. Cassandre and Lucian Bernhard, and he eventually became
one of a handful of contemporary advertising designers to develop a
distinctly modernist approach to graphic design. It emphasized
clean layout, asymmetrical composition and sans-serif typefaces,
and it was rooted in the often witty union of word and picture.
</P>
<P>
   Federico used headlines as an armature to carry visual messages
and used type to approximate sounds on the printed page. One of his
most memorable designs, a 1953 advertisement for Woman's Day
magazine, typifies his brand of letter-form manipulation through
surprising shifts in scale and juxtapositions. Atop a large,
white-on-black headline, ``Going Out,'' a woman rides a bicycle,
its wheels made from the two ``o''s.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was part of a long-running campaign to convince potential
advertisers that three million devoted readers went out of their
way to buy Woman's Day. The ads succeeded in attracting attention
and new business, but just as important, they proved that a simple,
visual idea worked in a medium that was known for verbal
overstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Federico was once called ``the prince of Light Line Gothic'' (a
reference to one his favorite typefaces), but his work showed no
single style, only a love for the nuances of type.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50's, Federico experimented within the limitations of
type set in the traditional but cumbersome hot-metal process; he
later embraced early attempts at phototypesetting. One of his
proudest achievements was a 16-page booklet, ``Love of Apples,''
one of a series published by The Composing Room in New York; the
designers were given freedom to interpret specific subjects through
the marriage of type, photography and illustration. Federico tested
how extremely tightly hot-metal letters could be set next to one
another and remain legible.
</P>
<P>
   But his booklet was also a critique of the extremes of mass
marketing. He wrote: ``When we, in business, industrial America,
began to get smart about apples, we packaged them and packaged them
and packaged them until the apple itself became the package.'' He
metaphorically illustrated the point with a photograph of an apple
with a string tied around it. Federico's elegant touch made these
few pages not a screaming polemic, but visual poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Federico, who was born in New York on Feb. 6, 1918, began his
career doing ads for Bamberger's Department Store in Jersey City.
He then switched fields to become a designer for Fortune magazine
and Architectural Forum.
</P>
<P>
   But he preferred advertising to editorial layout and in 1948
took a job as an art director at Grey Advertising. There he met
Bill Bernbach, a founder of Doyle Dane Bernbach, the agency
credited with the innovative concept of forming creative teams of
copywriter and art director.
</P>
<P>
   Federico eventually moved to Doyle Dane Bernbach as an art
director and spent five years there, working on the Woman's Day
account and others. He then moved on to become executive art
director and creative director for various Madison Avenue agencies,
including Douglas D. Simon Advertising, Benton &AMP; Bowles and Warwick
&AMP; Legler, before co-founding Lord Federico (``It added a sort of
regal sound to my name,'' Federico once said), which became Lord,
Geller, Federico, Einstein.
</P>
<P>
   There he designed ads for scores of clients, including the
campaign, ``Yes, The New Yorker.'' In 1991 he left the agency to
become an advertising and graphic design consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federico was known as `El Supremo,''' said Samuel P. Antupit,
president of Common Place Books, who met Federico more than 30
years ago. ``Gene was, and is, the art director's art director.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Lisa
of Hillsdale, N.Y., and Gina of New Canaan, Conn., and four
grandchildren.

NBC PROCEEDS WITH PLAN TO BUY SHARES OF PAXSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC is ``on track'' to complete a deal to acquire a 32 percent
interest in the money-losing Paxson Communications Corp. as early
as next week, an executive close to the negotiations said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But several details remain to be worked out and ``it could still
fall apart,'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   The move may be the first step in an outright acquisition by NBC
of Paxson, which owns a group of 73 television stations that reach
more than 75 percent of the homes in the country. Paxson
Communications operates a national network called PaxNet, which
consists mainly of repeats of family-oriented programs like
``Touched By An Angel'' and ``Diagnosis Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson Communications is owned by W. Lowell Paxson, who built
his PaxNet network on the strength of his accumulation of stations
that formed the Home Shopping Network. It reported a net loss of
$64.9 million for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's interest in Paxson is driven by its longtime desire to
create a second national distribution outlet, which NBC could use
for entertainment programming that it owns the rights to, a second
executive close to the deal said. NBC could also use the Paxson
stations as backups for its main network should it have future
problems with affiliated stations. NBC has clashed with its
affiliates in the past and further confrontation among all networks
and affiliates is expected as the networks try to eliminate the
fees they pay to affiliates for carrying network programs.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives declined to comment Thursday on the negotiations
and executives from Paxson could not be reached. The deal, worth
about $400 million, would be on a much smaller scale than the
planned merger between Viacom Inc. and the CBS announced earlier
this week. But it too was made possible by a deregulation decision
by the Federal Communications Commission last month. That decision
allowed one company to own more than a single television station in
cities with as many as eight broadcast stations.
</P>
<P>
   In the proposed deal, NBC _ a subsidiary of General Electric _
is limiting its initial purchase to 32 percent because of a
continuing FCC regulation that bars a company from owning two
national broadcast networks. The recent changes in the rules on
station ownership include a provision that a company owning less
than a third of a station is not considered its owner as long as
another company owns as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NBC could not acquire all of the Paxson stations
without exceeding the current FCC rules that cap station ownership
for one company at 35 percent of the country's homes.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the executives close to the deal said that NBC was
likely to include in the agreement a provision that would allow it
to buy the full company, should the FCC announce further
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives hope that the FCC will act to further loosen
regulations on stations and network ownership. If NBC is allowed to
complete the purchase, it could use the Paxson stations to create a
second national network of its own.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, which has the cable channel CNBC for business news and
MSNBC, an all-news cable channel, has sought for years another
distribution system for entertainment programs it owns. Previously,
the network had bid to acquire the Family Channel, a cable outlet,
for that purpose but lost out to the News Corp. NBC would like to
be able to re-use programs to help cover escalating program costs.
Thus, for example, NBC could take its successful ``Tonight'' and
``Late Night'' programs, and play them on its second channel at a
different hour the day after they originally play on NBC.

REPORT PREDICTS CHINA WILL AIM NUCLEAR MISSILES AT U.S. BY 2015  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An intelligence report released Thursday predicted
that within 15 years, China will be aiming missiles at the United
States that will be fitted with small nuclear warheads developed
with the help of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The new report, a National Intelligence Estimate that surveys
threats facing the United States, concludes that ``by 2015, China
will likely have tens of missiles targeted against the United
States, having added a few tens of more survivable land- and
sea-based mobile missiles with smaller nuclear warheads _ in part
influenced by U.S. technology gained through espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, a consensus within the U.S. intelligence community,
is the strongest statement yet from those officials on the value to
China of what the officials have called a long campaign of nuclear
espionage. It is being released in the middle of a public debate
over the significance of the allegations of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   A senior intelligence official said the report marks the first
time the intelligence community has explicitly stated that Chinese
warheads developed with stolen secrets will be aimed at the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Among its other findings, the report concludes that North Korea
could convert a recently developed rocket into a ballistic missile
capable of carrying small nuclear warheads to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Following the pattern set by North Korea, Iran could test a
ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States in the
second half of the next decade, the report states. But the
intelligence analysts differ over how soon such a test may come.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq could also test a North Korean-style ballistic missile in
the second half of the next decade, especially if it obtains
outside assistance.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the report found that Russia's nuclear ballistic
missile forces are likely to be limited by economic problems. The
intelligence estimate concludes that by 2015, Russia will maintain
fewer nuclear weapons on its ballistic missiles than are allowed
under either the Start I or Start II treaties. It also concludes
that an unauthorized or accidental launch of a Russian strategic
missile remains ``highly unlikely,'' but ``only so long as current
technical and procedural safeguards are in place.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Intelligence Council, which oversees intelligence
analysis, issued an unclassified summary of the report at the
request of Congress, where the potential threat from nuclear
missiles from North Korea, Iran and Iraq lies at the core of a
debate over whether the United States should develop an antimissile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Chinese espionage has now been added to that
mix, as the intelligence community struggles to fathom both the
damage done to national security from the apparent theft of nuclear
secrets and China's strategic intentions.
</P>
<P>
   In April the intelligence community concluded that China had
stolen nuclear weapons design information ``that probably
accelerated its program to develop future nuclear weapons.'' The
report added that the intelligence community believed Beijing had
probably used the information not to copy American warheads but to
accelerate its own program.
</P>
<P>
   In May intelligence officials also stated privately that the
warhead to be deployed on a new missile is likely to include some
stolen American technology. The Chinese missile, the DF-31, which
had its first flight test in August, is expected to have a range of
about 5,000 miles, and so will be capable of hitting Alaska and
Hawaii. But intelligence officials say it is more likely to be
aimed at Russia and other Asian countries because of its limited
range.
</P>
<P>
   The new intelligence estimate states, however, that China is
developing a longer-range, mobile ballistic missile that will be
aimed primarily at the United States. This land-based missile is
expected to be tested within the next few years, and is likely to
be equipped with a small warhead that uses stolen American design
information, the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   China is also developing a submarine-launched ballistic missile,
the JL-2, which the report concludes is likely to be tested within
the next decade. The JL-2 will probably be able to hit the United
States from within China, and will also be equipped with small
advanced warheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't copy our systems, as much as the stolen U.S.
technology has guided their efforts for their work on their own
weapons,'' a senior intelligence official said.
</P>
<P>
   As it modernizes its small, aging missile inventory, China is
following a strategic doctrine that emphasizes smaller,
lighter-weight warheads that can be used in mobile systems, the
report concludes. Mobility, the senior intelligence official said,
equals ``survivability.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also says China is ``significantly improving'' its
short-range missile systems and is increasing the size of its
missile forces deployed opposite Taiwan, though they may not be
larger than has been reported in the news media.

 &HT;    Catfish Hunter dead at 53
 &HT;    By Brian Zumbano
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERTFORD, N.C. _ Hall of Fame pitcher and Hertford native Jim
``Catfish'' Hunter died Thursday morning at 11 a.m. at his Hertford
home.
</P>
<P>
   According to the family spokesman, the Rev. Keith Vaughan of
First Baptist Church of Hertford, the 53-year-old Hunter was
surrounded by family and friends when he died just four days after
being released from Pitt County Memorial Hospital in Greenville.
Hospital spokesman Doug Boyd said Hunter was listed in fair
condition when he left the hospital Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Graveside services will be held Sunday at 3 p.m. at Cedar Wood
Cemetery in Hertford.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter made his mark in 1965 when he played with the then-Kansas
City Athletics straight out of Perquimans County High School. In
his 10 seasons with the A's, Hunter won 161 games, threw a perfect
game in 1968, won the Cy Young Award in 1974 and led the team to
three World Series titles.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was declared a free agent after the '74 season and signed
a $3.75 million contract with the New York Yankees. He retired from
baseball in 1979 after winning two more championships with the
Yankees and finished his career with 224 wins and a 3.26 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, N.Y. in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catfish Hunter was the cornerstone of the Yankee success over
the last quarter century,'' Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said
in a statement Thursday. ``We were not winning when Catfish
arrived, and since he arrived in 1975, the Yankees have the best
record in baseball and four World Series Championships. He
exemplified class and dignity and taught us how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, Hunter was diagnosed with amyothropic lateral
sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, a degenerative neurological
condition of the nerve cells that control muscle movement. The
disease leads to paralysis and had already rendered Hunter's arms
immobile. The legendary pitcher had already been battling diabetes
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's condition worsened Aug. 8 when he fell on the concrete
steps of his home and was rushed to the hospital. Although he was
unconscious for several days and was listed in critical condition _
he even suffered cardiac arrest at one point _ Hunter regained
consciousness and improved enough to be released Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Hunter died from ALS complications or his fall has not
yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it did when Hunter was diagnosed with ALS, the baseball
world was quick to express its condolences when news of Hunter's
death became public.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of baseball is saddened by the death of Jim `Catfish'
Hunter,'' Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig said in a
statement. ``He was a great pitcher, a great athlete and a great
competitor. The latter was particularly evident to me when I saw
him in spring training while he was battling Lou Gehrig's disease.
We will miss him and we send our deepest regards and sympathies to
his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fame and riches that baseball stardom brought him,
Hunter retired to his hometown of Hertford where he spent his days
hunting and fishing with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   While the country knew him as merely ``Catfish,'' a nickname
coined by former Oakland A's owner Charlie Finley, he was just
plain Jimmy in Hertford.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never played the part of the famous athlete,'' said Harrell
Thach, head football coach and former athletic director at
Perquimans County High School. ``He did a lot financially for the
athletic department but never made things like that public. He
meant a lot to this school and this town. This is a very sad time.
It's devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Perquimans County High School's most famous graduate, Hunter
gained local notoriety by leading the Pirates to a state title in
1964. Hunter chose the annual Perquimans High School Old-Timers'
Game on May 8, 1999, to unveil his new ALS Foundation. Since then,
Hunter made several public appearances to promote the foundation,
including a trip back to Oakland on June 12 where he was honored
before an A's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time when everyone needs to pitch in and help
continue the efforts Jim was putting forth with his foundation,''
fellow Hall of Famer and Williamston native Gaylord Perry said.
Perry was in attendance for the Perquimans Old-Timers' Game and
stayed in close touch with Hunter after their playing days came to
an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a shock,'' Perry said. ``I don't really know what
to say. I remember when I first made the majors, (Hunter) was still
in high school and all I heard about was how this kid in Hertford
was so good he wouldn't have to go to the minors, and he didn't. We
always got along. He was an outdoorsman and never liked the city,
just like me. He always came back home to Hertford and I respected
that. I just feel very badly for his family right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even North Carolinians outside of the sports world felt the loss
of Hunter's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news of Catfish Hunter's death brings people across North
Carolina great sorrow,'' North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt said in a
statement. ``And with his passing, we have lost a great friend and
an extraordinary North Carolinian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The status of 'superstar' never overshadowed the fact that he
came from a small town in rural northeastern North Carolina.
Through it all, he never lost his down-home manner or his down-home
values. He was baseball's son, but more importantly, he was North
Carolina's son. Just as he was always proud to have been a North
Carolinian, we will always be proud of his accomplishments. He will
forever be remembered and respected as a man of strength and
courage. Our prayers go out to his wife, Helen, their children and
all family and friends who mourn his loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is survived by his wife, Helen Overton Hunter; a
daughter, Kim Hunter-Layne, and her husband, Larry; two sons, Todd
Hunter and his wife, Joanna, and Paul Hunter; a grandson, Taylor
James Hunter, all of Hertford; three sisters, Mrs. Marie Leary and
Mrs. Elizabeth Roberson, both of Hertford, and Mrs. Lillie Ambrose
of Elizabeth City; three brothers, A. Marvin Hunter, Ray Hunter and
W.G. ``Pete'' Hunter, all of Hertford.
</P>
<P>
   Donations in Hunter's memory can be made to the Jim ``Catfish''
Hunter ALS Foundation, P.O. Box 47, Hertford, NC 27944, or to the
Perquimans County Rescue Squad, P.O. Box 563, Hertford, NC 27944.

COMPANIES REACH ACCORD WITH SOUTH AFRICA OVER AIDS DRUG POLICIES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pharmaceutical industry leaders said Thursday that
they had suspended a lawsuit against the South African government
over the price of drugs to treat AIDS and other illnesses, a
dispute that has led to protests against Vice President Al Gore at
several campaign appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was a challenge to a 1997 law that was aimed at giving
South African patients access to cheaper drugs like those for AIDS.
Alan Holmer, president of an organization representing more than 40
major drug companies that said the law infringed on their patent
rights, said he had received assurances from a senior South African
official that the law would soon be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Holmer, president the group known as Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, said he was optimistic that the dispute
would soon be settled.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have been trying for two years to persuade the
South African government to change the law. Holmer said that the
South African Health Minister, Dr. Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, had
given assurances that the bill would be redrafted next year. The
law covers all drugs but the focus of the dispute has been on AIDS
drugs because they are especially expensive and South Africa has
been ravaged by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 law had two provisions aimed at bringing down drug
prices. One sought to take advantage of a kind of gray market by
allowing the country's health minister to bring in drugs from
countries where they might be available for less, even though their
manufacture might not have been licensed by the companies that held
the patents.
</P>
<P>
   The second provision, called compulsory licensing, would let the
South African government license local manufacturers to make their
own generic versions.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical companies objected strongly, fearing that it
would erode their patent protections. They have pushed for help
both from Congress and the White House, even raising the
possibility of economic sanctions against South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The complex trade issue has proved a problem for Gore, who had
represented the drug companies' point of view in talks with South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He has been confronted at campaign appearances by protesters who
selected him as a visible target. They have accused him of
heartlessness toward people with AIDS in South Africa and chanted
before television cameras: ``Gore's greed kills.'' The vice
president's advisers have been troubled by denunciations they call
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials have said that the dispute has blocked
efforts to find other ways to reduce the cost of AIDS drugs in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 6 million of South Africa's 44 million people are
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

REPORT ADDRESSES STANDARDS IN MARKETING OF ALCOHOL TO MINORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a report to Congress that was prompted by public concern over
advertising's role in under-age drinking, the Federal Trade
Commission has recommended tightening the standards aimed at
preventing beer, wine and liquor companies from marketing to people
younger than 21.
</P>
<P>
   But while the yearlong study that produced the report uncovered
many instances in which the companies ignored the standards, it
stopped short of recommending stricter regulation of the industry,
which governs itself when it comes to advertising.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the report found that ``alcohol placement has
occurred in PG and PG-13 films with significant appeal to teens and
children; in films where the advertiser knew that the primary
target market included a sizable under-age market and on eight of
the 15 television shows most popular with teens.'' The report
suggests that all companies restrict product placement to R-rated
and NC-17 movies, which it identifies as one of the ``best
practices'' in the industry, but does not insist on outside
enforcement apart from adopting monitoring by a third party.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the report noted that only half of the eight
companies included were able to show that most of their ads were
shown to audiences in which most people were older than 21. ``Two
companies' data showed weeks when many ads (as high as 25 percent)
were shown to majority under-age audiences,'' the report stated,
adding that the other two companies were unable to demonstrate
whether they had complied or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're dealing with is an industry that doesn't know when
to say when in marketing to kids,'' said David Jernigan, associate
director of the Marin Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and
Other Drug Problems. ``They can't even follow the codes they wrote
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Z. Bernstein, director of the commission's Bureau of
Consumer Protection, said the commission was directed to
investigate possible changes ``within the context of
self-regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   More extensive recommendations were not part of what Congress
asked, Ms. Bernstein said. ``We will follow up, certainly, and see
what happens,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report was based on information supplied, under
confidentiality agreements, by eight large brewers, distillers and
wine companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among its recommendations are that companies prohibit ads with
``substantial under-age appeal, even if they also appeal to
adults.'' While no specific campaigns were mentioned, the Budweiser
advertisements featuring talking frogs and lizards have been
frequently criticized for charming children as well as adults.
Anheuser-Busch, which makes Budweiser, was among the companies that
provided information to the commission. The others were
Bacardi-Martini USA, Brown-Forman, Coors, Diageo, Miller Brewing,
Stroh Brewery and Seagram.

CLINTON UNVEILS PROGRAM TO BUY BACK GUNS FROM PRIVATE OWNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf to say program is first federal effort of its kind) (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stepping up the federal government's fight against
gun violence, President Clinton on Thursday announced a $15 million
program to buy back firearms from private owners.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the first federal effort of its kind, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development would provide grants of up to
$500,000 to police departments around the country to buy back and
destroy as many as 300,000 weapons, mainly in and around public
housing projects. The department is suggesting that authorities
offer $50 per gun, either in cash, food, gift certificates, toys or
tickets to sporting events.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement capped a day-long rally and lobbying push
here by scores of mayors, police chiefs, religious leaders and
other local officials who favor tighter gun controls.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Every gun turned in through a buy-back program means
potentially one less tragedy,'' Clinton said at a White House
ceremony where he was flanked by mayors and uniformed police
chiefs.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said in a telephone interview
that the program would reach at least 30 sites nationwide beginning
in late November.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a gun around the house that's accessible, that's
not being used by a sportsman or a hunter, and you need a small
amount of money,'' Cuomo said, ``bring it in and we'll buy it.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The money for the federal buy-back will come from existing
department grants and does not require congressional approval.
Unlike other buy-backs, the federal program will target weapons in
and around public housing projects.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nation's 3,400 public housing authorities will be eligible
to join with local police departments in partnerships to buy back
and destroy the firearms. Grants of up to $500,000 per police
department will be provided on a first-come, first-serve basis.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Authorities will accept guns, no questions asked, said David
Egner, a housing department spokesman. But if the police later
trace the weapon to a serious crime, like a murder, the previous
owner could be prosecuted. Guns found to be stolen will be returned
to their owners.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a rally later Thursday on the steps of the Capitol, civic
leaders and law-enforcement officers praised the president's plan,
and called on House and Senate negotiators to break their impasse
and hammer out new gun restrictions, including requirements for
child-safety locks on all guns and mandatory background checks on
all people who buy firearms at gun shows.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to say to the House, join the Senate in giving us
some extra tools,'' said Mayor Wellington E. Webb of Denver, a
Democrat who is president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want gun safety because we want our cities to be safe and
our schools to be safe,'' said Mayor Paul Helmke of Fort Wayne,
Ind., who is a Republican.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hector Torres, the chief of police in Bridgeport, Conn., said in
an interview, ``We've had buy-backs in the past, and they're a
useful tool to remove weapons from the community.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and police officers who oppose stricter gun controls
held their own news conference at the Capitol, criticizing Clinton
for offering clemency to 16 Puerto Rican militants at the same time
he is seeking tougher gun restrictions. They also criticized the
visiting police chiefs for what they described as slacking off for
politics instead of tending to law enforcement.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to cardboard cut-out figures of uniformed police
officers, signifying stand-ins for officers fighting street crimes,
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who is on the House Judiciary Committee,
excoriated the visiting police chiefs for ``engaging in useless,
phoney, photo ops with the president.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The intensifying debate over gun control comes at time when
violent crime is actually on the wane nationwide. But a string of
shootings, including the massacre on April 20 at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., has provided new momentum for advocates
of tighter gun laws.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years, cities and local communities have
conducted gun buy-backs with varying degrees of success. In the
past year alone, officials in Los Angeles, Washington, Atlanta and
New York have started buy-backs.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Fishner, the criminal justice coordinator for Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani of New York, said the most recent buy-back program
operated by the New York City Police Department netted 1,800
firearms between July 15 and Aug. 15, and that one operated by the
Brooklyn district attorney's office netted 659 weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Washington, police bought back 1,164 guns in a
single day. Residents received $100 in cash for each weapon, the
money having been confiscated during anti-narcotics operations.
</P>
<P>
   And a program in Lexington, Ky., last October offered $100 in
McDonald's food gift certificates for any working handgun, pistol,
rifle or shotgun. Some 331 firearms were turned in, including old
military rifles, seven assault rifles and one gun that was stolen
from a police officer's home.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Advocates said the initiatives remove thousands of guns from
private homes, if not necessarily from the hands of criminals.
Seizing on this potential benefit, Clinton twice repeated a
sobering statistic: The rate of accidental shooting deaths for
children under 15 in the United States is nine times higher than
the rate of the other 25 industrialized nations combined.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the anecdotal evidence, there is no definitive analysis
to support that buying back firearms reduces gun violence or crime.
As a result, the housing department plans to conduct a $1 million
study of gun buy-back plans, including its own.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that gun buy-backs are largely a cosmetic effort
in a nation awash with more than 200 million firearms. Wayne
LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle
Association, said that if the administration was serious about
combatting gun crimes, it would spend the $15 million on hiring new
prosecutors and prosecuting felons.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a right to do what they want with their own
personal property,'' said LaPierre, who said the NRA does not
oppose gun buy-backs. ``But this is nothing more than a public
relations gesture that means nothing to drug dealers killing
people.''

 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Danforth, named Thursday to be the
government's special counsel investigating the fiery deaths of some
80 members of the Branch Davidian cult, as well as the aftermath,
said his job would be ``to answer the dark questions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference at the Justice Department, Danforth, a
former three-term Republican senator from Missouri, said that in
re-examining the FBI's raid on the cult's compound near Waco,
Texas, six years ago, he would concentrate on a handful of crucial
issues:
</P>
<P>
   ``Was there a cover-up? That's a dark question. Did the
Government kill people? How did the fire start? Were there
shootings?''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth separated issues he said he would explore from those he
said were beyond the scope of his inquiry. He said he would not
investigate the government's subjective judgments in its overall
handling of the Davidians, including whether it had been advisable
to try to dislodge forcibly them from their prairie redoubt _
initially to arrest members wanted for weapons violations, later
because of suspicion that children within the compound were being
molested.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're going to be looking at is whether there were bad
acts, not whether there was bad judgment,'' the new appointee said.
``And I want that understood. Our country can survive bad judgment.
I take it that every day for the history of America there's been
bad judgment. But the thing that really undermines the integrity of
government is whether there were bad acts, whether there was a
cover-up and whether the government killed people. ''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at the White House, President Clinton
praised Danforth, describing him as ``an honorable man and an
intelligent and straightforward man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I would ask,'' Clinton said, ``is that he
conduct a through and prompt investigation.'
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Clinton said he saw no reason for
Attorney General Janet Reno, under renewed attack on Capitol Hill
for her handling of the Waco episode, to step down.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said Danforth would be the first
prosecutor named by Reno to operate under the special-counsel
regulations written by the department earlier this year to replace
the widely criticized independent-counsel statute, which expired in
June.
</P>
<P>
   As a special counsel, Danforth will have a complete array of
federal investigative and prosecutorial powers, including the
authority, through a grand jury that he will have the right to
impanel, to charge government agents with crimes. He will also have
authority to compel testimony and documents.
</P>
<P>
   That sweeping authority, which Danforth said had been a
condition of his accepting the post, raised even higher the already
high stakes of the Waco affair, suggesting for the first time a
possibility that officials of the FBI or the Justice Department
will face criminal charges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reno agreed to an outside inquiry after the disclosure in August
that FBI agents had fired incendiary tear-gas canisters at a
covered bunker near the Davidian compound in the hours before the
deadly fire inside the compound began. And last week the FBI
disclosed that it had infrared videotapes whose voice tracks showed
that agents had sought and received authorization from their
commander to fire those inflammable tear-gas rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth sought _ and, in a formal directive signed by Ms. Reno,
obtained _ specific authority to investigate whether government
employees used any ``incendiary or pyrotechnic device,'' started or
contributed ``to the spread of the fire'' or ``engaged in gunfire''
at the Davidian compound during the FBI's assault, on April 19,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possible criminal violations that Danforth will be
empowered to investigate is whether any government employee made
false or misleading statements about the FBI assault, or destroyed,
suppressed or withheld evidence concerning it, during Justice
Department and congressional inquiries since then.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth is also authorized to investigate whether the military
was used illegally during the Waco siege. Critics have raised
questions about whether special armed forces units took part in the
assault, although FBI officials have said members of the military,
while on the scene as observers, had no operational role.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Reno, who gave the order for the FBI
assault, announced that she would now recuse herself from any
dealings concerning the inquiry because, as she put it, ``I will
obviously be a witness.'' In her place, Danforth's contact at the
Justice Department will be Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, who
held a lesser position at the time of the operation and was not
then assigned to Justice Department headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was confident that he could operate without
interference from the department, Danforth said, ``I know I'll be
given the independence, because I wouldn't have done this without
it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Reno has been besieged by complaints from congressional
Republicans in the wake of the disclosure about the use of
combustible tear gas. Some of those lawmakers have demanded her
resignation, but Thursday she again said she would stay on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't run from controversy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth acknowledged that he would walk a tightrope in trying
to obtain the voluntary cooperation of crucial witnesses in order
to provide a detailed public accounting of the facts at the same
time he is armed with prosecutorial powers that could lead him to
convene a federal grand jury, which would impose secrecy on
evidence obtained by that process.
</P>
<P>
   He said his strong desire to produce a detailed final report
could be in conflict with the use of a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we proceed with the investigation,'' he said, ``we have to
bear in mind that if we ever get to the grand jury point,
obviously, secrecy is in place. I'm just telling you the balancing
act that we're going to have to go through along the way. Getting
the facts, that's order No. 1, but hopefully in a form that can be
made public.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth named as his deputy Edward Dowd, the U.S. attorney in
St. Louis. Dowd, a Democratic appointee, is stepping down from his
prosecutorial job to join Danforth by signing on as a lawyer in the
former senator's law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Before naming Danforth, Reno had looked for a prominent
Republican to quiet the angry protests in Congress that followed
recent disclosures that FBI agents had fired combustible tear-gas
rounds after years in which Ms. Reno and FBI officials had said
that nothing the government had done in the course of the tear-gas
assault could have ignited the deadly fire.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Reno has taken responsibility for the
government's actions, but she has steadfastly blamed Davidian
leader David Koresh for the blaze. In recent days, she has said
that the new evidence did not alter her view that the cultists were
responsible for the fire, after which the bodies of about 80
Davidians were recovered, including those of children.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth acknowledged that his inquiry might involve some of the
same evidence and witnesses as those of the planned congressional
inquiries into the Waco events. Danforth, who met later Thursday
with congressional leaders, said he would not seek to block the
lawmakers' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to try to tell Congress what to do or what not
to do,'' he said, ``or what I think they should be doing.''

TV SPORTS: NCAA PURSUES INCREASE IN BILLIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   March Madness is about buzzer beaters, upsets by Princeton, Fab
Fives _ and gobs of cash. With CBS Sports in control of televising
the men's Division I basketball tournament, the National Collegiate
Athletic Association has benefited mightily from the network's
generosity.
</P>
<P>
   A three-year, $166 million deal made the NCAA comfy from 1988 to
1990.
</P>
<P>
   That was replaced by a seven-year, $1 billion deal to run
through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were so pleased with each other that in 1994, they
tore up the deal with three years remaining and wrote a new one
that called for CBS to pay $1.7 billion from 1995 until 2002. No
other networks got to bid.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's rights payment of $200.9 million in 1998 accounted for 88
percent of the revenues for the tournament, dwarfing ticket sales
of $24.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   With three years of Madness left before the current contract
expires, the NCAA evidently wants to cash in, asking willing
suitors to submit proposals for what could be a 10-year deal worth
$4 billion or more. The offers _ a starting point for negotiations
_ are due as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Renfro, an NCAA spokesman, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The roster of CBS's competitors will be ABC/ESPN, Fox/Fox Sports
Net and ISL Worldwide, the firm that markets the Olympics and the
World Cup. (NBC is not interested.) Incumbency usually has its
advantages, but in this case CBS will not have one of them: the
right to match a competitor's offer.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Walt Disney Co.'s ABC and ESPN divisions
appears to present CBS's strongest challenge. If the NCAA wants
broader coverage of the tournament _ that is, showing all games
nationally and possibly adding a day or two to the first and second
rounds _ then ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 provide a powerful package. ESPN
and ESPN2 would carry nearly all the games, with ABC showing some
weekend telecasts and with cross-promotions to tournament oldies
playing on ESPN Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have the perfect platform to support the NCAA's
growth,'' said Rosa Gatti, an ESPN spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is interested, but it cannot offer everything ABC/ESPN can.
Fox Sports Net cannot clear out its busy National Hockey League and
National Basketball Association schedules to accommodate the spring
tournament as fastidiously as ESPN and ESPN2 can. Also, FSN would
not be able to carry as many of the other championships staged by
the NCAA as ESPN and ESPN2 can.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is formidable. As a division of Viacom, which agreed to buy
CBS this week for $37 billion, CBS would be in a corporate family
with MTV and VH1, which are not natural cable partners for the
tournament. Viacom's portfolio also includes a stake in the UPN
network. CBS could argue that UPN as a partner would keep all games
on broadcast TV, which reaches more fans than cable. Or, it could
team up with a cable network like the USA Network, as it does in
golf, or with TNT, its partner on the past three Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has an Internet sports strategy through its 20 percent stake
in Sportsline USA, one of several Web investments by the company.
In July, 4.2 million ``unique'' home and workplace users visited
CBS Sportsline, according to the Media Metrix research firm,
compared with 4.0 million for ESPN.com.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to know whether Viacom will be less hungry to
keep March Madness at nearly double CBS's current payments, or feel
so ravenous to keep a marquee property that the cost would be a
mere bag of shells.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone must be convinced that $400
million for a three-week event is necessary, or worthwhile, at a
time when CBS is also paying $500 million annually for its National
Football League rights. CBS chief executive Mel Karmazin, who would
be Viacom's president, is especially persuasive; he persuaded the
world that CBS would not lose money on its NFL deal.
</P>
<P>
   It is also hard to tell how much the digital future will play
during these negotiations. If the technology of digital compression
transmits not one, but four CBS networks, then a cable partnership
may not be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card is ISL, which would like to be a partner with a
network. It is well known to the NCAA for trumpeting a proposal for
a post-season college football playoff. For March Madness, ISL
could help finance a network's bid to get hold of the marketing
rights. More adventurously, ISL could buy the rights to the entire
tournament and sell half to one network, half to another.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about whose assets are better ultimately may not
matter. At issue is whether any bidder is willing to risk letting
the tournament slip away for a decade without making a blockbuster
offer. As one executive involved in trying to buy the NCAA package
said, ``The advantage goes to the carrier that is willing to make
the biggest investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Airwaves  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``1st &AMP; Ten,'' Sportvision Inc.'s yellow, electronic
first-down line, which debuted last year on ESPN's Sunday Night
Football, will be seen on ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' and Fox's
NFL telecasts this season. CBS uses a similar, but different
technology.
</P>
<P>
   _ The return of ``Kiner's Korner'' after Wednesday's Mets game
on Fox Sports New York was worth waiting for, if only for Ralph
Kiner's memories of Choo Choo Coleman. The ``Korner'' generated a
1.4 rating, a small drop-off from the 1.6 for the game.

G.O.P. TRIES TO FIT TOGETHER PIECES OF SPENDING PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress spent Thursday struggling over spending
bills that President Clinton has pledged to veto, as Republicans
searched for a strategy and the administration assaulted their
political priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders met in private, looking for a solution to a
half-trillion dollar puzzle: how to fit together a federal budget
by Sept. 30. No final strategy appears to have materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on that,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, emerging from one of the meetings. The House and Senate
have 14 working days to finish a dozen spending bills before the
end of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have pledged to do it without breaking
self-imposed spending caps or draining surplus Social Security
funds. But some Democrats and moderate Republicans are arguing that
the caps, which limit spending on domestic programs other than the
military to about $268 billion, are too tight.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans leaders say few prospects remain for a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not mixing the spending and the tax cuts in the same
pot,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert then appeared to do just that. Taking a stance that
seems to be part of a developing Republican strategy, he said that
if Clinton carried out his pledge to veto the Republicans' $792
billion tax cut, the president would be responsible if the spending
bills ended up ``dipping into the Social Security trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the Republicans' attitude was ``evidence that
this has been pretty much about politics all along.'' But he did
not rule out compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether we're going to meet and work
together,'' the president said. ``My door is open, and I hope we
will.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration, having stymied the Republicans' drive for a
big tax cut and sensing a political issue in the making, was
stepping up a verbal attack on the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget debate is crystalizing the philosophical
differences between Democrats and Republicans,'' said the secretary
of housing and urban development, Andrew Cuomo.``They want to cut
the funding to the poorest Americans _ less money for the homeless,
less money for people with AIDS, less community development.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, in a statement, said Cuomo had recklessly
distorted the facts about a bill that ``takes care of our neediest
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday night then passed the bill, a $68 billion
measure for the Department of Veterans Affairs, HUD, the
Environmental Protection Agency and other independent agencies, on
a 235-to-187 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-written bill cuts the White House request for
funds for housing by nearly $2 billion, for NASA by about $1
billion and the National Science Foundation by $285 million. The
Senate probably will restore some or all of the money for space and
science.
</P>
<P>
   The bill included $26.1 billion for HUD, which is $2 billion
more than last year. But, the White House said, the cuts in the
president's request directly affect more than 73,000 homeless
people, 25,000 rental vouchers assisting families moving from
welfare to work and repairs for tens of thousands of apartments in
public housing.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also terminated one of President Clinton's pet
programs, AmeriCorps, which the White House said gave 66,000 young
people public-service jobs and allowed them to earn money for
college.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the Democrats won procedural victories on two
other spending bills, blocking Republican attempts to cut mass
transit funds and to protect oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate deflected a move by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., to
cut public transit funds for New York and California by $278
million. Those states account for nearly half the nation's mass
transit riders, and the Transportation secretary, Rodney Slater,
said the amendment ``would have penalized millions of commuters in
our largest cities.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, Shelby withdrew the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Senate spent hours battling over Republican amendments
to a $14 billion spending bill for the Interior Department. Among
the battles was an attempt by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson, R-Texas,
to let energy companies avoid paying new royalties on oil pumped
from public land. The oil companies would owe about $66 million for
1998, the Interior Department said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., has blocked Hutchinson's move.
The Senate failed to make much progress on the Interior bill on
Thursday; the argument will continue into next week.

GOP WON'T PLAN COMPROMISE WITH CLINTON ON TAX CUT 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders all but gave up on their tax-cut
package Thursday, saying they have no plans to negotiate a
compromise with President Clinton after his expected veto next week
of the $792 billion tax relief bill.
</P>
<P>
   Although they left the door slightly open to possible talks with
the White House, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said
Republicans ``are not willing'' to engage in drawn-out negotiations
with Clinton that would likely yield only a small tax cut tied to
more spending increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president were to veto this bill, that would pretty
well kill it for this year,'' Armey said. The bill was passed by
Congress earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., also said
negotiations with the White House would be a useless exercise for
Republicans because Clinton is more interested in adding spending
to next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of negotiating with the president, Republican leaders
said they would try to commit most of the money in their tax relief
bill to the Social Security Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president vetoes this tax bill we believe that $792
billion ought to go right into that (Social Security) lock box ...
so that the president can't spend it,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Clinton has vowed to veto the GOP bill. He renewed
that pledge again Thursday, saying its tax reductions could end up
jeopardizing needed funding for education, Medicare and debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax plan passed by the Republican leadership would not
permit these priorities to be pursued,'' Clinton said at a White
House news conference. ``We could never pay off the debt, it
doesn't add a day to the life of the Social Security or the
Medicare trust funds, it doesn't provide for prescription drug
coverage and (it) would require cuts in education and law
enforcement.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The president said he is not opposed to a tax cut. ``Whether
there is a bill, of course, is up to them,'' he said. ``But if
they're saying, well, `It's our way or no way,' then that is
evidence that this has been pretty much about politics all
along.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Clinton has proposed a smaller tax cut in the range of $250
billion to $300 billion over the next 10 years, an amount he says
will provide as much tax relief for middle-income Americans as the
legislation pushed by the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wants to work with congressional Republicans,
not only on the budget and taxes, but on gun control legislation
that is part of a larger juvenile justice bill. ``We can have an
agreement. But it is up to them,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a historic opportunity to lift the burden of debt off
the next generation. We can literally not only continue to pay down
the debt, but America, in 15 years, if we stay on the present path,
could be debt-free for the first time since 1835. That would
guarantee a whole generation of low-interest rates and
prosperity,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that lawmakers are back at work on next year's
appropriations measures after a month-long summer recess, ``it
would be unconscionable if they were to leave again'' without
approving the juvenile crime bill with its tougher gun control
measures, he said. The measure would tighten loopholes in laws
governing sales at gun shows, require safety locks to be sold with
guns, and ban the importation of large-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also has threatened to veto the juvenile justice bill if
it does not include new gun control provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need legislation that will strengthen our present laws, not
weaken them. We need legislation that applies to all gun shows, not
a bill that allows criminals to turn flea markets and parking lots
into open-air gun bazaars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tax cut and gun control fights with Clinton,
House Republican leaders also are struggling with rebellious
members who want to pass a tough managed care bill that would give
patients the right to sue their health maintenance organizations
for malpractice. Clinton also has been calling for passage of a
so-called patients' bill of rights measure.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday two GOP lawmakers, Reps. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and
John Shadegg of Arizona, unveiled more details of their own
legislation that would give patients a limited ability to pursue
their grievances in court. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
had initially indicated that he was supporting their efforts on
managed care reform but has not yet signed on to the Coburn-Shadegg
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   When asked at a news conference why the House leadership had not
joined them in backing the measure, Shadegg said sarcastically,
``They were busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the measure, which include some of the most
conservative members of the GOP House membership, warned their
leadership that Republicans could be hurt in the elections next
year if they continue to ignore the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers suggested they would sign on with Democrats to
force the issue to the floor if Republican leaders do not agree to
support the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate already has passed a managed care reform bill that
does not cover most insured Americans and does not include the
right to sue. The bill was strongly opposed by Clinton and Senate
Democrats, and many House Republicans have rejected it as
inadequate.

NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR ANNOUNCES RETURN TO PROFITABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ National Semiconductor Corp. on Thursday
reported a return to profitability after five quarters of losses.
Excluding a one-time gain from a stock sale, National reported a
modest profit. Analysts had expected another loss.
</P>
<P>
   National's return to positive earnings reflect its exit from the
personal computer microprocessor business, where it had been
bloodied badly in a stiff price war with the Intel Corp. and
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. National reported last week that it had
completed the sale of its Cyrix subsidiary to Via Technologies Inc.
Via made an initial payment of $167 million, with additional
payments to be dependent on Cyrix sales.
</P>
<P>
   National reported its results after the close of the market. Its
shares closed at $32, up 12.5 cents, close to its 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   For its fiscal first quarter, which ended Aug. 29, National
reported earnings of $47.1 million, or 25 cents a diluted share,
compared with a loss of $104.8 million in the comparable period a
year earlier. Sales rose 2.6 percent, to $481.8 million, from
$469.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   First quarter 2000 earnings include a one-time gain of $48.4
million from the sale of Fairchild Semiconductor stock. Without
this gain, the company realized a pretax profit of $1.2 million for
the quarter. Analysts had expected National to report a loss of 13
cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks corporate
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, at this time, the company is positioned about
exactly where we've been driving it for the past few years,'' Brian
Halla, National's chairman, president and chief executive, said in
a telephone conference call with securities analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ahead of schedule on the return-to-profits plan we
announced on May 5,'' he said. ``The analog business is extremely
robust.''
</P>
<P>
   In exiting the PC microprocessor business, National is basing
its hopes for near-term sales growth on analog chips, which are
used in cellular phones and other telecommunications devices. The
analog market has enjoyed stronger-than-expected growth this year,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   For the long term, the company is promoting its concept of a PC
on a chip, which reduces nearly all semiconductor components of a
personal computer to one chip, which could be used in various
information and computing appliances. Several high-profile
companies, including IBM and America Online, have announced devices
using the National chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook from here depends on the sustainability of analog
demand,'' said Drew Peck, an analyst with SG Cowen. ``But the real
story for the future remains the PC on a chip.'' Halla, he said,
has bet that such a product would open up a whole new market for
small, inexpensive devices. ``In theory he's right,'' Peck said,
``but the actual realization of that goal will depend on execution
and marketing, and it's still a little early to judge them in that
regard.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They will practice together Friday morning because
they are sisters. They might even practice together Saturday if
they should become opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Serena Williams said. ``We haven't got there
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In certain parts of the world _ that is, the planet inhabited by
Richard Williams _ the two sisters are fully expected to be
opponents Saturday. He predicted it before this U.S. Open began,
and now the sisters are in the semifinals of the singles as well as
the doubles. ``My dad, he's playing the best,'' Serena said
Thursday. ``He's really playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh,'' added Venus, sitting next to her sister at a press
conference, maybe putting us on with deadpan humor, or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting the ball, also,'' Serena said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is,'' Venus concluded.
</P>
<P>
   They are all having a terrific tournament, the father in
prognostication, the sisters in performance. The sisters are also
responsible for wholesale shifts of humankind across the grounds of
the National Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   There was a wholesale exodus from the already yawning Arthur
Ashe Stadium Thursday to Louis Armstrong Stadium, suddenly
two-thirds full and vibrant with over 6,000 fans, eager to see the
Williamses play Monica Seles and Mary Joe Fernandez in doubles, a
6-3, 6-3 victory for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's a very competitive match,'' Serena said. ``Venus
and I, Monica and Mary. We're all Americans, so it's an
all-American matchup. I don't know anyone who wouldn't want to go
out there and watch that matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday the Williamses will bring their energy to the main
stadium. Serena will play Lindsay Davenport at 1:30 p.m. or so, and
Venus will play Martina Hingis after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we've played the players that we're playing before,''
Venus said. ``I've been in the semifinals of a Grand Slam before.
Serena has been in the semifinals of pretty large tournaments
before. She's seen me in large matches before. We've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   They are most certainly there. Venus, just turned 19, with her
wide-receiver physique, and Serena, not quite 18, with her running
back physique, both with acquired subtlety and generic positive
energy, are making a whole generation of players look passe.
</P>
<P>
   Steffi Graf, just 30, retired a couple of weeks ago. Jana
Novotna, almost 31, will retire at the end of the year. Fernandez,
just 28, was up a set against Venus, then slipped on a wet spot and
lost in the fourth round. Seles, not yet 26, won the first set
Wednesday night before Serena turned Seles' legs to rubber with her
power and her placement. Afterward, Seles basically admitted she
could not keep up with the heat her young opponent was packing.
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses, who seemed like lunar outsiders a year or two
ago, now hear cheers from the whole spectrum of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, this is what's happening,'' Venus said. ``People
are running to be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jumping in,'' Serena said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, if you saw something good, wouldn't you want to be
in it? I would,'' Venus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely would,'' Serena agreed.
</P>
<P>
   They finish each other's sentences as adeptly as they cover each
others' backs in doubles. The wide-court game is part of the
education of Venus and Serena Williams, who are using shots and
strategies they did not command a year ago. ``Definitely getting
the practice in,'' Venus said. ``But yet playing great doubles,
working on your shots.''
</P>
<P>
   According to their father, they are preparing for each other. It
happened at the Lipton this spring, with Venus winning the third
set. There is a school of thought that Serena is programmed to let
her older sister win a Grand Slam tournament first, but I would pay
to be present when somebody had the nerve to say that to the very
determined face of Serena.
</P>
<P>
   Does Venus know everything about Serena's game? ``I don't know,
I hope she's telling me everything,'' Venus said, as Serena raised
her eyebrows just enough to make her sister giggle.
</P>
<P>
   There is a theory that the sisters might default their doubles
semifinal late Friday afternoon if one or both has advanced to the
finals. But both vowed they would play the doubles, and Venus noted
that Chanda Rubin is in the other half of the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, if we get to the doubles final, there will be three
black persons on the court,'' Venus said. ``That will be just
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   A year or two ago, their father's clumsy intrusion of racial
themes infuriated some tennis fans, but the sisters have muted the
controversy. Now it is all about tangible pride and growing skill _
and the clatter of fans following these luminous young women.

 &HT;    `The blood's pumping just as fast as ever'
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This fall will be a big one for Florida State coach
Bobby Bowden. He soon will sign a five-year contract that will pay
him $1.9 million annually in salary, second to Florida's Steve
Spurrier among college coaches. Bowden needs seven victories to
become the fifth Division I coach in history to win 300 games. He
turns 70 on Nov. 8. And he has another team capable of winning the
national championship. This week Bowden, whose No. 1-ranked team
hosts No. 10 Georgia Tech on Saturday night, sat down with staff
writer Tony Barnhart to discuss his past, present and future.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you first got into coaching, did you think you'd be
doing this at 70?
</P>
<P>
   A: Naw, I sure didn't. The first time I ever paid attention to
retirement was when Darrell Royal (of Texas) and Frank Broyles (of
Arkansas) retired back in 1976. Both of them were 53 years old, and
I just figured that's when I would retire, too. But then I went
past 53 and never thought about it. Then, when I got to 63, we were
winning all the time, and I didn't feel like I ought to retire. So,
unless my health goes or I start losing too many games, I have no
desire to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you still get excited before a big game, like the one
against Georgia Tech on Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   A: I get as pumped up now as I ever have. People don't see it on
the outside because as you get older you learn how to hide it. But
on the inside, the blood's pumping just as fast as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At this point in your life, does losing hurt more than
winning feels good?
</P>
<P>
   A: It ain't even close. When we win a ballgame, it's like we're
supposed to win. People just want to know who do we play next. But
when you lose, it almost kills you. I can't stand them losses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You lost the national championship game to Tennessee in the
Fiesta Bowl last January. Where does that rank on the list of
painful losses?
</P>
<P>
   A: Losing to Tennessee wasn't half as painful as losing to
Florida (32-29) the year before. We had them beat and let them get
away. That one hurt for a long, long time. Tennessee hurt because
it was a national championship game, but in a way, I felt like they
deserved it. It wasn't a fluke. They won every game, and they beat
us. Can't argue with that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While you've finished in the top four for 12 straight years,
you still have only one national championship to show for it. How
much does that bother you?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's one complaint I hope stays with me. People say Bowden
has been close all these years, but he can't do it (and win a
national championship). But if I can stay close, I can keep my job.
There's something to be said for consistency. If somebody told me
that I could go 6-5 this year, win a national championship next
year but then have to go back to 6-5, I wouldn't do it. I can't
stand the idea of all those losses. I just can't get mad at 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lot of guys have won one national championship, but only a
handful have won two. How big a deal is winning your second
national title?
</P>
<P>
   A: When we finally won our first one, I'm sure a lot of people
thought I would retire. But after I won one, I wanted to win two.
And if I win two, I'll want to win three. ... When you're a
competitive person, you're just not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What put you on the path to win this consistently?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the key things is we've been able to keep coaches.
Two, I've always thought the prime areas to play football were
Southern California and Florida. So we're in the perfect place. The
other thing is, we've been here a long time. When I first came to
Florida State in 1976, you could ask a kid, `Who is Bobby Bowden?'
and they wouldn't have any idea. They knew who (Florida coach) Ray
Graves was. They would see him every Sunday on television. So we
had to get a television show. So, now the kids do know about
Florida State, and they know after 24 years, there is some
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've always said that one of your dreams as a young coach
was to return home as the head coach at Alabama. How close did you
come to getting that job?
</P>
<P>
   A: When Ray Perkins left Alabama (in 1986), I thought they were
going to offer me the job, and I was about ready to go. I really
thought they were going to bring the old boy back home. But I
wasn't the choice. When Bill Curry left (in 1990), Hootie Ingram
(then the Alabama athletics director) called me, and he told me,
`You're the guy I've always wanted.' I thought about it for about
an hour but decided no. It was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why was it too late?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was in my 60s, and we were doing well here, and I finally
decided: Why go up there and be in Bear's shadow? Because up there,
that's all you're ever going to be. That goes for anybody. The
first time, I would have gone, because I thought that's where I was
destined to go. I loved Alabama. When I came here, it was with the
thought that eventually I would go back home. But the next time,
(wife) Ann and I decided we should stay here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did it hurt that Alabama would hire somebody from Georgia
Tech (in Curry) and pass on a boy from Birmingham?
</P>
<P>
   A: I couldn't believe it. I like Bill, but I really couldn't
believe it. I'm thinking, `I'm just the guy they need!' Everybody I
talked to said I was. I had people from the governor on down
telling me that I was the guy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How big a deal is winning 300 games?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not very big at all. That's a record that slips up on you,
and all of a sudden, there it is. I've never made that a goal. But
I guess when I get up around 320 or so, then that's going to start
getting tight.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would it feel for a boy from Birmingham to break Bear
Bryant's Division I record of 323 wins?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughing) To a lot of people I know, I guess that would be
pretty sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If your team stays undefeated, you'll be going for career
victory 300 at Clemson against your son Tommy. Where is Ann going
to sit?
</P>
<P>
   A: I imagine there will be a division that day, with all the
Clemson folks in the family on one side and the Florida State folks
on the other. I think she's ingrained to be sitting on the Florida
State side. Besides, I've got the credit card in my back pocket.
Tommy can't help her, there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think about your legacy? How you'll be remembered?
</P>
<P>
   A: When I finally retire _ if I'm able to retire _ then I'll
look back at my career. But as long as you have another game to
play, I'm afraid to look back.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why can't you take a moment right now to look back and enjoy
what you've accomplished?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know of any profession in the world where you can get
leveled as fast as you can in this one. You can be riding high,
national champions, then all of a sudden _ (clapping his hands)
Bam! You're nothing! I guarantee you _ if I lose two games in a
row, they'll say, `He's too old. Get a younger guy.'
</P>
<P>
   Q: There will come a point when opposing recruiters start using
your age against you. How will you handle it?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm getting ready to sign a new five-year contract. The point
is, I have no desire to retire, and they have to believe me or not
believe me. But the health thing, no one can figure out. Only God
knows that. I just don't know what else I would do. I love Europe,
but I get tired of it in two weeks. I love golf, but in about a
month I'm tired of it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What would you miss the most about coaching?
</P>
<P>
   A: When I get out of coaching, my testimony won't be nearly as
strong. When I talk to 1,000 kids at a (Fellowship of Christian
Athletes) camp, if I'm the ex-head coach at Florida State, it won't
mean as much. So as long as I'm healthy, I feel I have an
obligation to keep going.

 &HT;    Ohio State starters to see home reflected in game against UCLA
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ The heart of Ohio State's successful recruiting
is right here in the Buckeye state.
</P>
<P>
   But John Cooper's ability to pluck a player or two from the
fertile football grounds of California, Florida and Texas has
supplemented the home-grown talent nicely.
</P>
<P>
   When the 13th-ranked Buckeyes face No. 14 UCLA on Saturday, four
OSU starters from California will face their home-state team:
linebacker Na'il Diggs, running back Michael Wiley, wide receiver
Ken-Yon Rambo and quarterback Austin Moherman.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs, a two-year starter and preseason All-American, is the
linchpin of OSU's linebackers this season. Wiley, a speedy senior
tailback, carries the weight _ and fate _ of the Bucks' running
game. Rambo, a high-school superstar passed over by UCLA, is poised
to become OSU's next great receiver with his lightning speed. And
Moherman? Well, he only has the future of the Bucks' offense in his
hands as he vies for the full-time quarterback job.
</P>
<P>
   Each will get his chance to show his home-state school what it
missed. Of the four, only Rambo was seriously considering signing
with UCLA. But when his ACT scores initially fell short of the
required minimum, the Bruins backed off. (He eventually passed).
That left USC and Ohio State, he said. With the uncertain future of
then-USC coach John Robinson, Rambo chose OSU.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley said it was his mother, Felicia, who nudged him toward the
Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother said, `Go to Ohio State,''' he recalled. ``I said,
`Ohio? I don't want to go to Ohio.' But she wanted me to get away
from home, experience different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Diggs, who moved to Los Angeles to live with his older sister
after his mother died when he was a high school freshman, was all
set to attend USC. But when his sister's boyfriend, Charlie Parker,
unexpectedly was fired as the Trojans' basketball coach, Diggs
changed his mind. He signed with OSU instead.
</P>
<P>
   Moherman, who played football at the same high school as former
USC quarterback Todd Marinovich, said he grew up hating the Bruins.
Though he was recruited by them, in the end, neither wanted the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting to Midwestern life and its weather was toughest for
Diggs and Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs remembers his first winter workout at the Woody Hayes
Athletics Center. He was indoors, sans coat, stretching and waiting
for training to begin. When he saw his teammates bundled up and
heading out the door, he could hardly believe it: ``You mean we
have to go out there?'' he asked, incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley, a San Diego native, smiles when he recalls his first
encounter with snow. He was coming out of class one day when he saw
the white flakes falling and felt a shiver from the winter chill.
With his next class clear across campus, he did the only thing a
reasonable Californian would do: He called a cab.
</P>
<P>
   With UCLA's linebacker corps depleted by suspensions _ all three
starters were suspended for two games for their involvement in a
handicap parking scandal _ Wiley shouldn't need a cab to get to his
destination Saturday. But he'll need to hang on to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   After putting behind him his problematic fumbles toward the end
of last season, Wiley lost the ball against Miami last week _
though he wasn't even hit. He bristles when asked why it was a
problem for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably was my strength,'' he said. ``I feel like I got a
lot stronger up top to be able to hold onto the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are sure to test that theory.

 &HT;    Uga VI: Taking over dogged tasks
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia played 13 freshmen against Utah State last
weekend, and it will play at least one more Saturday, when Uga VI
trots onto the field at Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Uga VI will succeed his father, Uga V, as the Bulldogs' mascot
in a ceremony 10 minutes before kickoff against South Carolina. Uga
VI's given name is ``Whatchagot Loran,'' after Loran Smith, the
sidekick of Georgia radio play-by-play announcer Larry Munson.
</P>
<P>
   Uga V, a 9-year-old solid white English Bulldog has been the
mascot since 1990, and he has become a national figure on and off
the field. But he must hang up his collar because of progressive
arthritis and old age.
</P>
<P>
   Uga V, whose given name is ``Magillicuddy II,'' isn't the
school's most successful mascot. He was 65-39-1 in his nine-plus
seasons and was the first of the line not to preside over an SEC
championship. But he is the most famous, appearing in the Clint
Eastwood movie ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' and
being named college football's best mascot in 1997 by Sports
Illustrated, which put him on its cover.
</P>
<P>
   One of Uga V's most famous acts was in 1996 when he tried to
jump up and bite Auburn wide receiver Robert Baker, who got a
little too close after catching a touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does that so often; that's just the first time it's been
captured on film,'' cheerleading coach Marilou Braswell said. ``One
game, my husband (former Georgia linebacker Kim Braswell) was
holding him when one of the ball boys came running by. Uga jumped
up, hit the kid right in the chest and knocked him down. Sudden
movements make him jump.''
</P>
<P>
   But age has robbed Uga V of much of his zeal, and he is unable
to fulfill his most important duty _ running onto the field ahead
of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's better to have a young dog out there'' _ Uga VI
is 1 _ ``instead of an old dog that might go down,'' senior captain
Steven Herndon said. ``I mean, that's what this is really all
about, isn't it?

 &HT;    Moss: Vikings could score 60
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons' rematch of the NFC Championship Game with
the Vikings is still a couple of days away, but Minnesota wide
receiver Randy Moss already has gone deep _ or maybe off the deep
end.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after complaining that his team was struggling to find
the magic it had while scoring an NFL-record 556 points and going
15-1 last season, he dropped a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (quarterback Randall) Cunningham's on point, that means the
offensive line is on point,'' he said. ``If either one of those is
on, or both of them are on, we're going to put 60 points up on that
board. Fifty, 60 points, we're capable of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, this aroused a reaction _ albeit modest _ among
a Falcons defense that last year gave up 18.1 points per game,
fourth-fewest in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he's got confidence in their ability,'' said Pro Bowl
cornerback Ray Buchanan. ``The thing is, you got to prove it. Last
year, they put up pretty big numbers on people, but when we played
them, I thought we did a pretty good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Vikings scored 20 points in the first 21 minutes of
the NFC Championship, and then scored seven in the final 51 minutes
before losing 30-27 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vikings have cause for optimism. For starters, all 11
are back on offense. Talented wide receiver Jake Reed, who missed
the NFC final, returns.
</P>
<P>
   Add the fact that Atlanta has only five cornerbacks, one less
than last year, and one, Michael Booker, won't play because of a
strained thigh. That leaves starters Buchanan and Ronnie Bradford
and two reserves _ Elijah Williams and Keith Thibodeaux, who each
have logged but one year in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons secondary coach Ron Meeks, however, wasn't conceding
much Thursday after handing out videotapes of the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to adjust,'' he said. ``We don't game-plan for
one man. They got too many weapons. We game-plan for what they try
to do overall. Changing coverages is a big thing. They present
problems with their heighth advantages over us.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss is 6 feet 4, Carter 6-3 and Reed 6-3. Buchanan is 5-9,
Bradford 5-10, Williams 5-10 and Thibodeaux 5-11. But as Buchanan
said, the Falcons did pretty well against Minnesota in January
after a shaky start. Moss had just one catch, for 4 yards, in the
final 51 minutes after catching five for 71 and a score in the
first 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting heat on Cunningham is the first thing,'' he said.
``And we took away a lot of the deep passes, and made them throw a
lot of nickel-and-dime stuff they're not very good at.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rolled (double-teamed) on Randy a lot, and I played
backside a lot (against Cris Carter, who had six catches for 67
yards). We mixed it up ... so they wouldn't know what we were
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar strategy is sure to apply, although nobody is giving
away secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In the nickel, Williams will be in the slot, where Carter and
Moss _ mostly Carter _ will work. Williams' primary responsibility
will often be to bump his man hard to disrupt timing
</P>
<P>
   ``The easiest part is re-routing dudes because you know you
don't have deep responsibility,'' said Williams. ``Meeks is always
talking about being a student of the game, and that's what I've
been doing, watching a lot of film on Cris Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   Thibodeaux, who had 14 tackles as a rookie reserve with the
Redskins in 1997 before getting cut last summer and spending the
season out of football, may see spot duty and play in the dime
package. His strength is quickness.
</P>
<P>
   Moss garnered attention last year while catching 69 passes for
1,313 yards and an NFL rookie record 17 touchdowns. But Falcons
safety Eugene Robinson, who busted up a potential game-winning bomb
to Moss in overtime, wants to make sure Moss isn't getting too much
credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched (Carter) forever. The dude is phenomenal,''
Robinson said of a receiver who last year caught 78 passes and
scored 12 touchdowns while moving to No. 4 on the NFL's career
receptions list with 834.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not stupid. When I look at their personnel, I go, `Wow!
Cris Carter. Wow! Jake Reed. Wow! Randy Moss. Who-ee!' Then you got
Robert Smith coming out of the backfield. This team can embarrass
you in a hurry.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ In what would be the nation's most far-reaching plan to
make teachers accountable for their students' academic progress,
members of the Denver teachers union are expected on Friday to
approve a plan that, for the first time anywhere in the country
would link raises to their students' performance. The proposed
two-year pilot program here is part of a growing national trend to
give teachers a financial stake in the academic performance of
their students.
</P>
<P>
   Other districts reward teachers for meeting goals set at the
start of the school year, and some, including Columbus, Ohio, pay
teachers bonuses for student achievement. But if the two-year
Denver pilot plan leads to a permanent system, traditional criteria
for annual raises, like years of service and cost-of-living
allowances, would be scrapped for salary increases based solely on
classroom results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay-for-performance based on student outcome is totally
unheard of,'' said Andrea Giunta, president of the Denver Classroom
Teachers Association. ``No one has ever done it. But we think this
is a reasonable program, so we decided, `Let's test it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed experiment in Denver, a city that, like others, has
struggled to improve student achievement, especially among students
from poor and minority families, comes as an increasing number of
school systems around the country are turning to assessment tests
and other standards to determine whether students will be held back
a grade or sent to tutoring sessions beyond the regular school day.
</P>
<P>
   In two sections of Brooklyn, two city business groups provide
money to pay for bonuses for teachers, principals and
superintendents if their students' performances on statewide tests
improve.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of improved educational results has gained such
currency that the leading candidates in next year's presidential
campaign, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
have made raised standards and teacher accountability a cornerstone
of their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere else in the country has a school district moved so
close as Denver to tying teacher salaries directly to results
achieved in the classroom. At the end of the proposed pilot
program, school officials here would evaluate the results and
recommend criteria on which to base pay increases. The teachers
union would then vote for what would become a permanent system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merit programs in the past have not worked because they have
been based on false premises and they have been evaluated in uneven
ways,'' said Robert F. Chase, president of the National Education
Association, the nation's largest teachers union. ``But proposals
like the one in Denver are taking merit pay into a different
direction, and we're seeing folks around the country who are
willing to look at new programs and say, `Let's take a look at it
and see what it means.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jewell Gould, director of research for the American Federation
of Teachers, the second-largest teachers union, said: ``Denver is
clearly breaking new ground with this system. It's also one of the
better proposals I've seen on merit pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The test program is expected to be approved by Denver's 4,300
public school teachers, partly because for two years it would
supplement current pay schedules for the 450 teachers who
participate. Teachers in Denver's public schools now earn annual
salaries from $24,000 for first-year teachers to $56,200 for a
41-year veteran. Teachers in the pilot program can make as much as
$1,500 a year more.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan is approved, school administrators intend to select
three groups of five schools _ four elementary schools and one
middle school _ to put the plan into effect. In the second year the
school district plans to add a high school to each of the three
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Each teacher in the pilot schools would receive $500 for
participating and an additional $1,000 if, by the end of the
academic year, a majority of the teacher's students showed an
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Each group of participating schools would be evaluated for
student improvement by a different indicator. One group would
measure scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. One would measure
tests and classroom work given by the teacher. The third would
measure student improvement in classrooms where teachers have
sought to increase their teaching skills by taking a development
course.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the trial period, a panel of two officials from
the school system and two from the teachers union would evaluate
the results and recommend achievement criteria for a permanent
system on which pay increases would be based, replacing the current
system that essentially rewards teachers just for returning each
fall.
</P>
<P>
   School district officials said the pilot program would cost
about $3 million, increasing the overall level of raises for the
two-year period to about $8 million. Amy Hudson, a spokeswoman for
the school district, said the money would be offset by cuts
``outside of the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teachers said Thursday that voting for a permanent plan
based on student improvement would be much harder than approving a
two-year test program that has no financial downside.
</P>
<P>
   They also expressed concern over how their students would be
evaluated to measure success and how pressures to spur classroom
improvement might have adverse effects on them _ issues that school
district officials conceded would not be known until the permanent
system was devised.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Tisdell, a teacher for 29 years _ the last 19 at Newlon
Elementary School, where she teaches the fifth grade _ said that
teachers typically set performance goals for the year anyway and
that putting a price tag on them might generate competition among
teachers who generally work together to seek common solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that would be good for morale for teachers,'' Ms.
Tisdell said.
</P>
<P>
   And what if the criteria used to measure improvement do not
match a teacher's academic plan?
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Garcia-Pettit, who teaches English to Spanish-speaking
children in the third and fourth grades at Newlon, said that even
the most objective of the three standards in the pilot program, the
Iowa tests, which are administered in English, might not be suited
to the children she teaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, there's a question about crop rotation,'' Ms.
Garcia-Pettit said. ``This is an urban school _ we don't teach crop
rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go along with pay-for-performance,'' she said of the
pilot program. ``You'd be crazy not to. But I'm a little leery of
the future. I want it all spelled out. I'd want to know exactly
what they're talking about. Right now, I just don't know.''

BUSH LIST OF CONTRIBUTORS HARD TO FOLLOW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, saying he supports
rapid campaign finance disclosure, Thursday posted a list of his
Republican presidential campaign contributors since July 1 on his
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   But what Bush posted amounted to an electronic version of an
883-page paper report. The report cannot be sorted by amount, date,
city or employer, so no easy analysis of Bush's contributors can be
made. And if someone spent just one minute looking at each page of
Bush's report, it would take more than 14 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides also announced that the governor has raised $49.3
million so far, continuing to collect record amounts of
contributions at an unprecedented pace. Rival Gary Bauer also
announced Thursday that he had passed the $5 million mark in
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush earlier this year promised to file his official campaign
reports electronically with the Federal Election Commission so
sortable databases could be immediately available to political
researchers for analysis. Bush said in Dallas on Thursday that he
began filing electronically to the FEC Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In his first gubernatorial campaign in 1994, Bush promised to
file his campaign reports electronically with the Texas Ethics
Commission, but dropped the practice once he was sworn into office.
He began to file electronically in 1998 after the Houston Chronicle
noted his failure to fulfill that campaign promise.
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponents Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Bauer and John
McCain all have made electronic filings with the FEC. So have
Democratic candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his new Internet disclosure of all his campaign
contributions on his own Web site is ``unprecedented'' in a
presidential campaign. The contributions are posted at
www.georgewbush.com, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always supported rapid disclosure of campaign
contributions as a health campaign finance reform,'' Bush said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``By daily posting an updated list of contributors to my Web
site, Americans will be able to look for themselves to find out who
is helping to fund my campaign,'' Bush said. ``What they will find
is that their friends and neighbors, grass-roots people in every
state in this nation, are responding to my message of prosperity
with a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   At the evening news conference, Bush added, ``It is important to
have instant disclosure and the purpose (for putting it online) is
for full disclosure. We want to file forms where people can analyze
them as much as they want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Simon, executive vice president of Common Cause, said Bush's
posting is a ``small step'' toward full disclosure. But Simon said
the inability to sort the data makes it almost useless to someone
interested in meaningful campaign finance research.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that if there is a ``glitch'' in the technology that
makes it difficult to search, he would have it corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said Bush also was being ``misleading'' in touting the
Internet filing as campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of the other Republican candidates have called for a
ban on soft money,'' Simon said. ``Governor Bush's position ... is
very far short of that. Banning of soft money is the most important
campaign finance reform issue today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed a ban on soft money to political parties from
corporations and unions but not by individuals. Soft money is the
unlimited contributions that are made to the Republican and
Democratic parties for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A Common Cause study released last week found that 40 of Bush's
``Pioneer'' fund-raisers are among the top soft-money contributors
to the Republican National Committee, donating more than $2 million
since the first of this year. The Pioneers are people who have
raised more than $100,000 for Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of Gore's $100,000 money-raisers are among the top
soft-money donors to the Democratic National Committee, giving more
than $800,000 since Jan. 1, the Common Cause report found.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Internet filing covers contributions he has received
between July 1 and Aug. 27. He said it will be updated daily.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier reports already have been available on Bush's Internet
site. However, those are so poorly printed that they are almost
unreadable.

AVANT SHARES RISE IN RESPONSE TO RULING IN TRADE SECRETS CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares in the Avant Corp. soared Thursday after
a federal judge ruled in its favor regarding certain claims in the
trade secrets case brought against the company by Cadence Design
Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Cadence, which is based in San Jose, and Avant, based in
Sunnyvale, Calif., make competing computer-aided design, or CAD,
software that is used to develop new chips. Cadence sued Avant in
December 1995, accusing it of stealing Cadence's software code,
copyright infringement, conspiracy and other improprieties. Avant
was formed through the merger of Integrated Silicon Systems Inc.
and Arcsys Inc., a company formed by four former Cadence executives
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Ronald M. Whyte ruled that
Cadence's trade secret claim in the forthcoming trial against Avant
was barred by a release signed by Cadence in 1994. The judge ruled
that the 1994 release bars all Cadence copyright claims arising
before the date of the release, but he allowed Cadence to proceed
with copyright claims arising after the date of the release.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the suit is scheduled for trial on Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, last December, the Santa Clara County Criminal
Grand Jury indicted Avant and eight current or former executives,
alleging a conspiracy to steal and actual theft of trade secrets.
The criminal case goes to trial on Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Avant shares closed Thursday at $23.8125, up $9.0625, in Nasdaq
trading. Cadence shares closed at $14.1875, up 6.25 cents, on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were divided on the significance of the ruling, noting
that though it removes some of the more onerous charges, a court
order still blocks Avant from selling certain products and leaves
open the possibility that the company will be found to have
infringed on Cadence's copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Smith, an analyst with Dataquest, said the ruling reduced
the threat to Avant by narrowing the case essentially to two
products, neither of which is current. ``Cadence went after the
whole thing because they wanted to put Avant out of business, and
that just won't happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Avant officials conceded that the ruling made it unlikely the
company would prevail in the copyright claims against its ArcCell
or Aquarius products but added that they no longer sell either
product. They said the ruling had no effect on Apollo, Avant's
current program.
</P>
<P>
   Smith McKeithen, Cadence's senior vice president and general
counsel, said the company would ask the judge to reverse his ruling
or permit an appeal. ``Although we don't view this as a major
setback, it does remove one of our theories of damages and we think
it ought to be tried,'' he said. ``There were a number of occasions
of theft of Cadence code.''
</P>
<P>
   He added of the ruling, ``I don't think it reduces the overall
effectiveness of the case.''

   WASHINGTON _ In a blow to Elizabeth Dole's presidential
campaign, her communications director said Thursday that he was
resigning to pursue opportunities in private industry.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Ari Fleischer, was one of the top officials of the
campaign, and his decision has left the Dole operation scrambling
to find a replacement at a time when Mrs. Dole needs to lay out her
positions and a strategy for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an easy decision for me,'' Fleischer said in an
interview. ``I'll miss the excitement and attraction of working on
a race like this. I told Mrs. Dole on Sept. 4. We had a wonderful
conversation and hugged each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But several Republicans close to the campaign said Fleischer had
long been dissatisfied _ and that Mrs. Dole was rattled by his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said he was considering at least three offers and that
he might even pursue opening his own consulting firm.

3 JAPANESE DRUG MAKERS AGREE TO SETTLE U.S. CHARGES OF PRICE-FIXING
VITAMINS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, France, Japan, Switzerland)   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department said Thursday that three Japanese
pharmaceutical companies had agreed to plead guilty to U.S.
antitrust violations and to pay more than $137 million to settle
charges that they took part in a worldwide conspiracy to fix prices
in the vitamin market.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement comes just months after three European vitamin
manufacturers _ some of the biggest and best-known pharmaceutical
and chemical companies in the world _ agreed to pay huge criminal
fines for what government prosecutors say was a decadelong
conspiracy to inflate the price of vitamins used in everything from
breakfast cereal to hand cream.
</P>
<P>
   In breaking up the cartel, the U.S. government has now recovered
more than $850 million and exposed a loose confederacy of vitamin
makers that met clandestinely for years, plotting in hotel rooms
and other places to divide up world markets and to artificially
increase the price of vitamins that were sold to virtually every
food, beverage and animal feed company in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The case does not involve the sale of vitamin tablets, commonly
sold at a drug store, but the ingredients that go into everything
from vitamin tablets to poultry feed and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   Although the companies that have confessed to taking part in the
conspiracy account for more than 90 percent of the world's vitamins
sales, it is unclear whether American consumers will receive any
compensation for purchasing products that, year after year,
contained over-priced albeit small vitamin ingredients. Several
class-action suits brought by large food makers and various other
groups could eventually benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty pleas came from Takeda Chemical Industries of Osaka,
which agreed to pay $72 million; the Eisai Co. of Tokyo, which
agreed to pay $40 million, and the Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. in
Tokyo, which agreed to pay $25 million, according to the
government. Takeda is the largest pharmaceutical company in Japan.
No executives were charged.
</P>
<P>
   Takeda, which sold vitamins B and C, released a statement late
Thursday saying it deeply regretted the matter and that any
employees involved in the case would be disciplined. The company
said all managers, executives, board members and an auditor would
have their pay reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Daiichi, which sold vitamin B, could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Pollini, a spokeswoman at the U.S. subsidiary of Eisai,
which sold vitamin E, said Thursday that she could only confirm
that the company was cooperating with the Justice Department's
investigation of anti-competitive practices in the vitamins market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecution of these three Japanese companies further
demonstrates the truly international aspect of the vitamin
conspiracy,'' Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general in
charge of the antitrust division, said in a statement. ``By
conspiring to fix the prices and allocate the sales of these
vitamins, these companies and their co-conspirators reaped hundreds
of millions of dollars in additional revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Hoffmann-LaRoche, a unit of Roche Holding of
Switzerland, agreed to pay $500 million and BASF AG of Germany
agreed to pay $225 million to settle accusations that they
master-minded the vitamin conspiracy, along with Rhone-Poulenc of
France, which was not fined because it cooperated in the early days
of the government investigation. It was the largest settlement ever
in a federal antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Two Roche executives also pleaded guilty and agreed to serve
jail terms in the United States. One of those executives had misled
investigators in an earlier investigation into price-fixing at
Roche, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1998, another vitamin maker, Lonza AG of Switzerland,
also pleaded guilty to price fixing in the vitamins market and
agreed to pay $10.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The government said Thursday that all three Japanese companies
and many of their executives were cooperating with the
investigation, which industry experts said could still involve a
few smaller players in the vitamins market.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese role in conspiring with the European companies
began in early 1991, the government said, and in the case of
Daiichi and Eisai, extended through February of this year. The
conspirators met regularly, sometimes under the fictional name
``Vitamins Inc.,'' to exchange sales information and to agree to
split up or allocate markets and volumes and to set prices in
violation of U.S. antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, lawyers involved in a class-action suit on
behalf of some of the world's largest food and beverage makers said
they were close to a settlement with the six European and Japanese
vitamin makers (though not Lonza), which had tentatively agreed to
pay $1.1 billion to settle price-fixing claims. A final agreement
is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Justice Department has stepped up its efforts to
crack down on a wide variety of global price-fixing schemes, many
involving food, chemical and other little-watched ingredients. In
1999 alone, the agency has collected more than $1 billion in fines,
more than all fines collected in the previous decade. That money
will be deposited in a federal crime victims fund, the agency said.

NFL '99: G'BYE GIFF, HELLO INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Next month, the 60th anniversary of the first pro
football telecast comes around. On Oct. 22, 1939, New York had
about 1,000 TV sets using experimental station W2XBS, owned by NBC.
They saw the Brooklyn Dodgers beat the Philadelphia Eagles 23-14 at
Ebbets Field before 13,057.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that TV cameras weren't that advanced. They
needed a lot of light. So every time a cloud passed over the field,
the TV picture went dark and as the day got cloudier, fans were
only able to follow the game through the announcers.
</P>
<P>
   And what legacy has that brought us?
</P>
<P>
   No, Pat Summerall didn't call the game. For the record, it was
Allan ``Skip'' Walz.
</P>
<P>
   But as we reach the turn of the century, TV's impact on the game
has been out of this world. If anything, it's the viewers left with
their heads in the clouds, spinning from all the information thrown
at them.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing you need to know about the 1999 NFL television
season is, like a lot of things, it's a little more retro. ``Monday
Night Football'' has warped back to 6 p.m. kickoffs and no stupid
pregame show. Two-man booths are coming back in vogue. And the
Cleveland Browns will be on as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in L.A., blackouts are what happen to viewers who've
been up at 7 a.m. for the first pregame show and try to make it to
the end of the Sunday night ESPN fare.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the gist of it, listed in alphabetical mayhem:
</P>
<P>
   ABC
</P>
<P>
   New look: For the second time in its 30-season run, ``Monday
Night Football'' goes with only two guys talking. Al Michaels.
Boomer Esiason. Once in a while, Leslie Visser shows off her hat
collection. ``I think the two-man setup will work fabulous,''
Michaels said. ``It'll allow the telecast to breathe. These days,
the way sports are done may be disconcerting. Viewers maybe are
used to hearing constant chatter and if you don't say anything for
four seconds it sounds like a minute. (With two broadcasters), you
don't have to keep a constant line of chatter going.''
</P>
<P>
   Old hook: The quick change from one year of 5:20 p.m. kickoffs
back to 6 p.m. ``comes from the upper echelon of the company,''
said MNF producer Ken Wolfe. Eisner's call? Seems even he couldn't
get to Moe's Tavern in time.
</P>
<P>
   For openers: Miami at Denver, with John Elway's No.7 retirement
ceremony at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know: ABC does this season's Super Bowl in January from
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Do you care: No more pregame riff-raff, meaning Gifferoo has
left the ESPN Zone for good.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: To boost ratings at midseason, Regis Philbin will be
added as the third man in, screaming ``Who wants to be a
millionaire?!'' during prolonged waits while instant replay is
being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   CBS
</P>
<P>
   New look: In a quiet cry for help, Randy Cross, Craig James and
Jerry Glanville _ a.k.a. nuck, nuck and nuck _ have been added to
the pregame show for Year 2. Mild-mannered Marcus Allen has been
banished to do interviews, Brent Jones shifts to game coverage and
George Seifert stumbled into a better sideline deal.
</P>
<P>
   Old hook: The electrifying Jim Nantz as host, counting down the
days to the NCAA basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   For openers: Oakland at Green Bay (Verne Lundquist and Dandy Dan
Dierdorf), 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know: Cross on pregame show hype: ``Sure, a lot is made
about pregame shows, but if we can be as good as our conference
(the AFC) we'll let the rest of it sort itself out.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you care: Local clairvoyant proclaims the AFC will have 16
teams finish below .500 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions: 1) CBS' merger with Viacom opens the door for MTV's
Daisy Fuentes as a sideline reporter; 2) Glanville sounds more and
more like Granny from ``The Beverly Hillbillies'' and will wrest
the title of ``Most Annoying NFL Commentator'' from Dierdorf.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN
</P>
<P>
   New look: Enhanced TV, the Internet side dish that'll allow
playing along at home, is planned for mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Old hook: ``NFL Countdown'' continues to be the place for
pregame info thanks to Chris Mortensen's hustle. And Chris Berman's
performance on ``NFL Primetime'' continues to be a thing to behold.
</P>
<P>
   For openers: The new Cleveland Browns host the same-old
Pittsburgh Steelers (Mike Patrick, Joe Theismann and Paul Maguire)
at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know: Stuart Scott has been added to the ``Gameday''
mix.
</P>
<P>
   Do you care: The correct spelling: ``BOOH-yah.''
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Theismann took one for the team last year, but he
implodes this season. First opportunity he has to misinterpret a
Maguire barb aimed his way, he snaps the ex-punter's leg like a
twig, a technique he learned from LT.
</P>
<P>
   FOX
</P>
<P>
   New look: They've added another NFL pregame show via cable
(``NFL This Morning'' on Fox Sports West at 8 a.m.) that'll start
at the same time as ESPN's ``NFL Countdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Old hook: Terry, J.B., Howie and Cris. Summerall and Madden.
And, of course, the ageless Dick Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   For openers: Dallas at Washington (Stockton and Matt Millen) at
10 a.m.; Minnesota at Atlanta (Summerall and Madden) at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know: Fox will use the ``First &AMP; 10'' electronic
yellow-line graphic during the games, started by ESPN, which now
uses the news ticker on its ``Sports Center,'' started by ``Fox
Sports News Primetime,'' which was started on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Do you care: TV theft is not a crime if everyone benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Bradshaw and Long find  way to crash Fox's Emmy
Awards show Sunday night to plug the new primetime show, ``Get
Real.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra points: NBC's Sunday morning/afternoon programming? Stuff
like ``Travel Cafe'' and ``Living Better with Carrie Wiatt,'' with
gymnastics thrown in this weekend. Too bad the WNBA is done....
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hill and his ``Sports Central'' crew (sans Lisa Guerrero)
continue their Sunday morning NFL pre-pregame show (Channel 2, 9
a.m.), and they're back on for an hour and a half at 4 p.m. with
wrapup material....
</P>
<P>
   Channel 7's Bill Weir starts ``Monday Night Live'' at the
beginning instead of the middle this year with a show that has a
slightly new format, geared more toward his schtick than Todd
Donoho's....
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's ``Sunday Ticket'' package, available on C-band dishes
and DirecTV, is up to 800,000 subscribers nationwide, which
includes 10,000 commercial establishments. The cost for the season
is the same: $159....
</P>
<P>
   If info from the 23rd season of HBO's ``Inside the NFL'' isn't
early enough _ first runs are Thursday night at 11 p.m. _ the
Sunday fix should start with CNN's ``NFL Preview,'' hosted by Bob
Lorenz, starting at 7 a.m. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
_Keith Jackson's ``Rumble Like It's 1999'' revival tour starts with
Saturday's Cal-Nebraska coverage _ Channel 7, 12:30 p.m., and Bob
Griese riding shotgun. It's the warmup act for the UCLA-Ohio State
game (with Brad Nessler, Gary Danielsen and Lynn Swann at 5 p.m. &QL; 
_CBS' luck with a Venus and Serena Williams potential final at the
U.S. Open. Both play semifinal matches today starting at 9:30 a.m.
on Channel 2. Saturday's women's final, however, is scheduled for
after the two men's semifinals, which begin at 8 a.m. You know, a
Lindsay Davenport vs. Martina Hingis finale wouldn't be a washout,
either. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
_KTLA will show the Dodgers-Mets games tonight and Saturday in high
definition television on its special KTLA-DT station. It's the
first time a local sports event originated by an L.A. television
station will be shown in the format. Why? This is like listening to
a Quiet Riot song on a CD as opposed to vinyl record. What nuance
of this Dodgers team are we going to pick up from an HDTV broadcast
that we can't already get from a distorted, over-the-air feed? &QL; 
_Fox Sports West loses one of the nicest people in the business,
Kitty Cohen, who announced her resignation this week as vice
president/general manager. She had been with the company since it
was known as Prime Ticket in 1988. &QL;

FLEET PAYS $1.9M TO END FRAUD CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Fleet Financial Group agreed to pay $1.9 million to
settle fraud charges that executives of the former Shawmut
Investment Advisers _ acquired by Fleet in December 1995 _
improperly used clients' commissions and then tried to conceal the
practice, federal regulators said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In an order filed in US District Court in Boston, the Securities
and Exchange Commission said the charges stemmed from practices at
Shawmut from mid-1993 to early 1996. Even though the practices
didn't take place on Fleet's watch, the regulators said a Fleet
unit, Fleet Investment Advisors, is liable as Shawmut's successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased to have this matter settled,'' said James
Mahoney, a Fleet spokesman. ``Fleet Investment Advisors was never
involved in any of this. We brought it to the SEC's attention as
soon as we became aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges relate to improper arrangements Shawmut forged with
certain brokerage firms, the SEC said. Like all money management
firms, Shawmut charged its clients _ mostly large institutional
pension funds _ commissions on investment transactions performed by
outside brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   But Shawmut failed to disclose to clients it was funnelling $1.8
million in commissions to a handful of brokerages, which in turn
directed new clients to Shawmut, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a conflict of interest,'' said Juan Marcelino, the
SEC's district administrator in Boston. ``An adviser can't use a
client's assets to benefit itself without telling the client.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawmut directed about $1 million in commissions to East West
Institutional Services, a Michigan-based brokerage, under a deal
that Shawmut would give it $1,000 in commissions for every $1
million of new customer assets East West steered to Shawmut, the
SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with that agreement, an East West employee,
Christopher P. Roach, referred a $600 million International
Brotherhood of Teamsters Local Union 710 pension fund account to
Shawmut. East West and Shawmut conspired to conceal their agreement
from the union, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement forced Shawmut into a position of breaching its
legal obligation to find the best price for its clients' stock
transactions, the SEC said. On several occasions, in order to
fulfill commitments to East West, Shawmut traders awarded
securities transactions to East West when it didn't have the best
price.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet said it discovered the practices shortly after it acquired
Shawmut in December 1995. It hired the Boston law firm Ropes &AMP; Gray
to help with an internal probe and turned the matter over to the
SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The Shawmut workers involved in the deals resigned or were
fired, Fleet spokesman Mahoney said. He added that Fleet has
already voluntarily returned about $1.7 million of the misused
commissions to clients. Another $200,000 remains to be paid to
clients that Fleet has so far been unable to locate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides charging Fleet, the SEC Thursday said it charged eight
former Shawmut employees, including the money management unit's
president, Michael J. Rothmeier, who plans to contest charges that
he signed off on required disclosure forms even though he knew they
were false. The case will go to trial before an administrative law
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Two other former Shawmut employees, Karen Michalski and
Christopher D. Sargent, without admitting or denying the SEC's
findings, agreed to pay $5,000 in penalties and not to work for an
investment adviser for 15 months.

HUNTER LOSES ALS BATTLE AT 53 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 15 years he was one of baseball's most dominant pitchers.
Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter won five World Series rings with the Oakland
Athletics and New York Yankees and strung together five 20-victory
seasons, pitched a perfect game, and won a Cy Young Award. You
can't do much more.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, at the age of 53, Hunter lost his battle with the
disease named after another New York Yankees great, Lou Gehrig,
dying at his home in Hertford, N.C., according to George Byrum of
Swindell Funeral Home. Hunter fell and hit his head on concrete
steps at his home Aug. 8. He was unconscious for several days after
the fall, and improved enough to be sent home from the hospital
Saturday, according to the Rev. Keith Vaughan, a family spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame righthander, who won 224 games before arm
trouble ended his career, first learned he had amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, which has no known cure, in September 1998. The disease
attacks nerves in the spinal cord and brain that control muscle
movement, causing progressive paralysis and leading to death.
Hunter also had diabetes and required insulin injections three
times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter started his career with the Kansas City Athletics in 1965
and didn't have a winning season until 1970, when he won 18 games
for Oakland. Then, after winning at least 20 games four consecutive
seasons, Hunter became baseball's first multimillionaire when he
was declared a free agent on a technicality after the 1974 season.
He signed with the Yankees for five years and $3.5 million and won
23 games for New York in 1975, leading the Yankees to their first
pennant in 12 seasons in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably the first player who broke it open for other
players to be paid what they're worth,'' said Hunter in 1987, a few
hours after he was elected to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner never doubted Hunter was worth
every penny, calling him the cornerstone of the team's 1970s
championships. Steinbrenner often said Hunter was more than a
crafty pitcher with a range of speeds and pinpoint control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He exemplified class and dignity and taught us how to win,''
Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates often said Hunter was a player's player, a competitor
but also a prankster who loved to have fun after the game. With the
A's, he grew a mustache and wore his hair long in the fashion of
the late '60s and early '70s. Yet, he retained his farmboy values
and spun stories with a country drawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fabulous human being,'' said Hall of Famer Reggie
Jackson, Hunter's teammate with both the Athletics and Yankees.
``He was a man of honor. He was a man of loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was also a dedicated outdoorsman. In fact, Hunter first
noticed the neurological condition in the winter of 1997-98 when he
was out hunting near his farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't lift my shotgun with my right hand,'' Hunter said.
``It was a little bit cool that day, and I thought there was
something wrong with me that would go away. But it just kept
getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   What Hunter thought might be a tick bite was indeed worse. After
visits to doctors in Norfolk, Va., and the Duke University and
Johns Hopkins medical centers, Hunter got the dreaded diagnosis. He
knew only too well that Gehrig, the Yankees' Hall of Famer, had
died of ALS in 1941 at age 37.

   Doctors put Hunter on a drug regimen to slow the disease but it
progressed quickly, leaving the once strong-armed pitcher unable to
function without help, mostly from Helen, his high school
sweetheart and wife of more than 30 years. Hunter made a brief
visit to the Yankees' training base in Tampa last spring. He was
barely able to shake hands with old teammates.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Hunter said he thought of his three children, Todd,
then 28, Kim, 25, Paul, 18, and a 3-year-old grandson, Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see them grow up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Old friends were shocked when they saw him. His arms hung limp
at his side. His hands seemed soft and puffy, a far cry from the
powerful hands of the pitcher and farmer he had been.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Athletics found Hunter in Hertford and he soon
became a favorite of team owner Charles O. Finley, who was intent
on promoting his players, pinning the nickname ``Catfish'' on
Hunter. It stuck with him for the rest of his life. Hunter
punctuated the Athletics' move to Oakland in 1968 with a perfect
game against the Minnesota Twins. Then came the five straight
20-victory seasons, and the AL Cy Young Award in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was declared a free agent by arbitrator Peter Seitz
because Finley had failed to make payments on an annuity that was
part of his contract. With baseball's reserve clause still in
place, Hunter's signing with the Yankees proved to be light at the
end of a long tunnel. Hunter agreed to his landmark deal with New
York and it was announced Dec. 31, 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was certainly the wakeup call about how underpaid players
were,'' said Marvin Miller, the head of the players' association at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   In today's baseball economics, Hunter's contract was a
small-change deal. But at the time it made him the highest-paid
player in history, and set the stage for full-scale free agency,
which began after the 1976 season. Hunter finished his career with
the Yankees in 1979. He returned to his hometown and his farm and
was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would trade all of that for good health,'' Hunter said as he
battled ALS. ``I'd be a groundskeeper and not let anybody know
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last May 8, on the 31st anniversary of his perfect game, Hunter
attended the kickoff event for the Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter ALS
Foundation in Hertford.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times you think you might go the next day, but you're not.
The main thing is that everyone is here and I appreciate it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral is scheduled for 3 p.m. Sunday in Cedar Wood Cemetery
in Hertford, behind the field where Hunter played high school
baseball.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Again, a big merger is remaking the advertising industry. But
this time it's the result of an internal realignment rather than a
major acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   True North Communications in Chicago, the world's
seventh-largest agency company, with estimated billings of more
than $12 billion, said Thursday that it would reorganize its two
principal advertising operations: Bozell Worldwide and Foote, Cone
&AMP; Belding Worldwide, both based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The revamping has been the subject of widespread speculation
since the Aug. 16 issue of Advertising Age carried a front-page
article with the headline ``FCBozell? True North Eyes Marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Effective immediately, about half the business handled by
Bozell, including all international accounts outside North America,
will be combined with Foote, Cone at a new flagship shop to be
called FCB Worldwide. Foote, Cone has handled twice the foreign
billings of Bozell Worldwide, making that agency the logical one to
use to try raising True North's profile outside the United States _
a crucial goal since the collapse two years ago of an overseas
alliance with Publicis S.A. in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the remaining parts of Bozell Worldwide, renamed
Bozell, will concentrate on North American accounts from six
offices _ including the significant Chicago, New York and Toronto
markets _ along with autonomous subsidiaries like Avrett, Free &AMP;
Ginsberg.
</P>
<P>
   FCB will be lifted into the ranks of the world's five largest
agencies in billings, estimated at $8.2 billion, compared with a
previous ranking of 13th for billings estimated at $5.9 billion.
And FCB _ which will add giant marketers like DaimlerChrysler and
Hilton Hotels to a client list that includes AT&AMP;T, Amazon.com, S.C.
Johnson, Levi Strauss, Nabisco Group Holdings and the U.S. Postal
Service _ will become the largest agency in billings handled in the
United States, the world's largest advertising market, at an
estimated $4.9 billion, up from No. 4 with estimated billings of
$3.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a forced merger but rather a combination of two
extremely willing partners,'' said David Bell, who became chairman
and chief executive at True North on March 31 after holding top
posts at Bozell Worldwide that included president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination makes sense from every aspect,'' he added,
``with very few client conflicts. The new FCB nearly doubles its
list of global clients and Bozell sharpens its focus to make it a
leading agency in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that, though, the realignment seemingly flies in the
face of a strategy that had guided True North since it was formed
in January 1995 as the successor to what had been FCB
Communications Inc. The creation of True North was intended to
provide a holding company framework for the start-up or acquisition
of a second worldwide agency network to complement, and not
conflict with, Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in late 1997, True North acquired Bozell, Jacobs,
Kenyon &AMP; Eckhardt, the parent of Bozell Worldwide, after turning
aside a hostile takeover bid from Publicis, a onetime partner
turned fractious rival. The goal was to help True North catch up
with rivals that operate two or more agency networks like the
Interpublic Group of Companies, Omnicom Group and WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Such network setups make it easier to handle disparate clients,
particularly the prized multinational giants whose spending
accounts for a continuously increasing share of global advertising
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But True North top executives and board members, who unanimously
approved the reorganization at a special meeting late Wednesday,
determined that operating a single worldwide agency network made
the most sense _ at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major step in the right direction, the right
structure at the right time,'' said Bell, 56, in a conference call
with reporters. ``It means that we can focus our resources on a
much smaller list of strategic priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It benefits everyone,'' he added, ``employees, clients and
Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The model True North now seems to be following is that of Young
&AMP; Rubicam Inc., which has devoted its time and treasure to
cultivating growth at a single large agency network, Young &AMP;
Rubicam Advertising, primarily through wooing added assignments
from existing clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in business today pooh-pooh big,'' said
Brendan Ryan, who becomes chief executive of FCB after serving as
chairman and chief executive at Foote, Cone. ``They're stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be big to be a competitive player in the global
arena,'' said Ryan, also 56, adding that while Bozell Worldwide and
Foote, Cone were ``not small,'' their worldwide rankings by
billings of 13th and 18th, respectively, were ``just not good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   For FCB ``to be No. 5 in global billings is a huge step
forward,'' Ryan said, ``and allows us to compete more
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   More efficiently, too.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization will result in annual pretax savings of close
to $25 million or $25 a share, said Donald Seeley, chief financial
officer at True North, along with a onetime pretax charge in the
third quarter of $65 million to $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   The savings, starting early next year, are to come primarily
from cutting real-estate expenses like leases, he added, and staff
expenses after ``selective reductions in positions that are
duplicative in administration and general management, not client
service, creative or new business.''
</P>
<P>
   Those aspects of the realignment are important because True
North executives have been anxious to persuade analysts that they
could improve operating margins, which have lagged those of its
largest rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Gains in the price of True North shares have lagged, too, though
the stock has performed more strongly in the last six months.
Shares of True North rose 81.25 cents Thursday, to $33.375, on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the consolidation, Bozell's Southfield, Mich., and
Costa Mesa, Calif., offices will become part of FCB, leaving Bozell
with offices under that name in Chicago, New York, Omaha, Seattle,
Toronto and San Mateo, Calif. Companies remaining Bozell clients
include Lycos, the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board,
the National Pork Producers Council, The New York Times and Unisys.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gene Bartley, who is 54 and had been president for North
American operations at Bozell Worldwide, becomes chairman of
Bozell. The man who had been Bartley's boss _ Leo-Arthur Kelmenson,
72, chairman and chief executive at Bozell Worldwide _ joins FCB as
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Kelmenson has long worked on Chrysler advertising, so his shift
to FCB as FCB gains the Chrysler-Plymouth and Jeep creative
assignments from Bozell Worldwide makes eminent sense.
</P>
<P>
   There are minor conflicts as a result of the consolidation in
Germany and the Asian-Pacific markets, which will be resolved by
resigning the accounts that would conflict with the larger clients,
Bell said, which are DaimlerChrysler and S.C. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Bozell operating in North America enables True North to
resolve much larger conflicts like Bank of America, handled by
Bozell, and Chase Manhattan, handled by FCB, as well as AT&AMP;T,
handled by FCB, and Bell Atlantic Mobile, handled by Bozell.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Bozell could always return overseas if True
North decides to buy another agency network like the Bates
Worldwide unit of Cordiant Communications Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ruling anything out in the future,'' Bell said.
``Having an open architecture is an important part of True North's
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   The realignment will have no effect on other True North units
like Temerlin McClain and the Diversified Companies division, which
includes BSMG, the public relations agency; Marketing Drive
Worldwide, a marketing services agency; RG/A Interactive; TN Media,
and New America Strategies Group, a multicultural unit that last
week acquired 49 percent of Don Coleman Advertising in Southfield,
Mich.

STANDING UP TO SEXISM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Wis.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)A year ago, my supervisor fired his assistant _ a
woman _ for what he said was poor performance. The assistant filed
a sexual harassment suit, which was settled out of court for a lump
sum. Soon after, the supervisor was promoted to department head. I
and the other women who report to him, however, are uncomfortable
talking to him, particularly behind closed doors. Even before the
suit, we observed that he didn't take women seriously. We consider
his promotion a signal that women aren't valued by the company. How
can we protect ourselves in this environment?(end italics)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For starters, avoid jumping to conclusions about the
harassment accusations. Without knowing all the details, you can't
be sure what he did or did not do. And even if he did something
stupid once, it doesn't mean that he will make a habit of it. ``You
shouldn't go in paranoid,'' said Sheila Wellington, president of
Catalyst, a New York-based nonprofit group that aims to help women
advance in business.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the level of anxiety, however, two or three of you
may want to have a confidential talk with the man's boss or with
the human resources department, said Ellen Bravo, co-director of 9
to 5, National Association of Working Women, based in Milwaukee.
Explain what specific incidents, aside from the harassment suit,
prompt questions about his attitude.
</P>
<P>
   And without being accusatory, say that you expect the company to
take such matters seriously. ``Ask for a clear channel of
communication to be set up,'' Ms. Bravo said.
</P>
<P>
   Within the department, monitor the situation as objectively as
possible, Ms. Bravo added. If the supervisor is respectful,
acknowledge it. If he isn't, document the uncomfortable situations.
That will help gauge the seriousness of any problems and may prove
crucial later if you take your concerns to upper management.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the supervisor has never harassed an employee, he may
have a Neanderthal attitude about women in the workplace. If you
find out that he clings to stereotypes about women, try to have him
see you as an individual. Talk to him about your goals and
expectations. Find out what he thinks it takes to succeed and let
him know that you value honest, frequent feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Working for an unenlightened boss can even prove valuable, Ms.
Wellington said. ``We often hear from women that among the people
they learned the most from were bosses that really were suspicious
of women's commitment and abilities,'' she said. ``They learned a
lot from just knowing how to deal with guys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ultimately determine that the situation is hopeless, Ms.
Wellington said, ``don't be afraid to bail out.'' Consider
requesting a transfer to a different department.
</P>
<P>
   But if you see the department head's objectionable attitude as
representative of the company's stance, Ms. Wellington added, ``you
may want to vote with your feet and leave.'' &QL;

December 1995, accusing it of stealing Cadence's software code,
copyright infringement, conspiracy and other improprieties. But a

HINGIS AND DAVENPORT MATCH THEIR BILLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Smiling her sly Garfield smile, Martina Hingis has
been nothing short of a tennis diva by poking at ``snobby'' New
York and the ``big mouth'' of Richard Williams, but she has been
uncharacteristically tactful in assessing her chances of winning
Friday's semifinal against Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Unassuming by nature, the defending champion Lindsay Davenport
has been nothing short of a wallflower by slipping around all
verbal frays and taking pleasure in her anonymity, and she is quite
comfortable having the colorful and carved Serena Williams absorb
the attention in the prelude to their semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange twist of pressure created by Richard Williams and
his bold prediction of a final between his two daughters at the
U.S. Open, the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the world have been all
but cast as names on an undercard. But you won't hear Hingis or
Davenport complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy being in the semifinals,'' said Hingis, who during
the last Grand Slam tournament wound up sunning herself in Cyprus
after her first-round loss at Wimbledon. ``I think I proved myself
again, and I have nothing to lose, basically, you know, going out
there against Venus. She still didn't win a Grand Slam. It's more
pressure on her in her own home country.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Davenport country, too. She is an American and defending
her title. But as is her style, she refuses to put pressure on
herself to repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a good time trying to defend this title, whether it
ends Friday, ends Saturday, or whatever,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   Just how quickly the Williams sisters are gaining on Hingis and
Davenport will be answered on Friday. And for the fit but loping
Davenport and the cunning Hingis, there is also this question: How
long can they hold up against the kind of muscle, speed and stamina
that the Williamses possess?
</P>
<P>
   So far, Hingis has maintained her edge on Venus Williams, with a
7-3 record against her. But Davenport has struggled against Serena
Williams, trailing her by 2-1 in head-to-head meetings. As Friday
unfolds, the attention and hype swirling about the Williams sisters
will either be fitting for the occasion or supplanted by the
almost-overlooked top two players in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to take her seriously,'' Hingis said. ``I feel like a
more experienced player with more confidence right now. And we'll
see what's going to come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were no predictions from the unusually demure Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Secret to Bhupathi's Success
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mahesh Bhupathi, from Madras, India, has discovered a
successful trend when selecting a mixed doubles partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese girls are lucky for me,'' Bhupathi said after he and
Ai Sugiyama won the U.S. Open mixed doubles title on Thursday,
defeating the Americans Kimberly Po and Donald Johnson, 6-4, 6-4.
In 1997, Bhupathi won the French Open mixed doubles title with Rika
Hiraki.
</P>
<P>
   Bhupathi has a knack for partnerships. On Friday he will team
with his countryman Leander Paes in the men's doubles final.
Bhupathi and Paes, the No. 1-seeded team, will face the 11th-seeded
team of Sebastien Lareau and Alex O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Although the matchup is not likely to draw many fans, Paes and
Bhupathi will benefit from New York's large Indian population.
Often, the ethnic crowds that follow Paes and Bhupathi are vocal
enough to motivate their countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day before yesterday was fantastic,'' Paes said, referring
to the doubles match with Justin Gimelstob and Richey Reneberg in
the third round. ``Didn't start too well. We were down a set. They
started saying, `Sare jahaan se achha Hidustan harnara.' I remember
the beginning of the third, we looked at each other, the song was
chanting in the back. I had goose bumps on my arms.''
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is the translation to the song?
</P>
<P>
   ``The song basically is not our national anthem, but it's like
our folk song,'' Paes said. ``To English, it doesn't come across as
arrogance. It just comes across as unity. Basically, what it says
is, `In the whole world, we will strive to be the best.'''
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek Gets Another Ace
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Upon further review, the ace record set by Richard
Krajicek during his quarterfinal loss to Yevgeny Kafelnikov on
Wednesday has been changed _ again. Although the unofficial
statistics put Krajicek's total at 49, the umpire's card showed 48,
and that is the record that stood up until another look at the
videotape Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On the first point of the 12th game in the fifth set, Krajicek
served an ace. The serve was called out by the line judge, but the
call was overruled by the chair umpire. The score was noted at
15-0, but the ace coding was not entered on the electronic
scorecard. At that point, the ace in question was Krajicek's 46th.
He went on to serve three more before the end of the match, making
a total of 49.

SPRAYING EXPANDS TO ENTIRE CITY IN NEW YORK'S ENCEPHALITIS BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City vastly expanded its week-old air raid
on mosquitoes on Thursday with pesticide spraying scheduled over
the next three days for all of Brooklyn and Queens and much of the
Bronx, as the number of suspected cases of the potentially deadly
St. Louis encephalitis grew to 60, including, for the first time,
three residents of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that ground spraying of malathion,
which kills mosquitoes, was planned for most of Manhattan in the
coming days, and that the aerial assault would continue over the
rest of the city until the first frost, probably at least a month
away. Air spraying is impractical in Manhattan because of the
density of the buildings and the evening crowds outdoors, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you not to create any undue or unnecessary alarm or
panic,'' Giuliani said at a City Hall news conference on Thursday
morning. ``There's no point in not spraying, because there's no
harm in spraying. So even if we're overdoing it, there's no risk to
anyone in overdoing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more dead mosquitoes,'' he added, ``the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger S. Nasci, a research entomologist at the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, said the current outbreak _
with nine confirmed cases, three of them fatal _ ranks among the
smaller incidences of St. Louis encephalitis, which infected about
2,200 people throughout the Mississippi Valley in 1975. But he said
that this epidemic presented a special challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that this is New York City, you have a very large
population at risk,'' said Nasci, who is assisting local officials
in fighting the disease. ``That's the reason for this very
aggressive aerial spray approach to control the mosquitoes.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they would not name the victims to protect
their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying will take place only when mosquitoes tend to be active,
from about 5 to 10 p.m. and from about 4 to 8 a.m., city officials
said. On Thursday night, the spraying began in parts of Queens and
the Bronx but was aborted because of heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the spraying, officials from the State Department
of Health and the CDC planned to spread 24 traps around the city so
that they can monitor mosquito levels and track the virus. Workers
from the police, fire, housing and transit departments were also
canvassing neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens to warn people of
the problem and distribute cans of insect repellent.
</P>
<P>
   City officials suggested that residents remain indoors during
the spraying, but asserted that malathion is not dangerous, though
it can cause some problems for people with respiratory illnesses.
They urged people to use insect repellent whenever they are
outdoors between dawn and dusk and to open only windows with
screens.
</P>
<P>
   The major expansion in the spraying campaign came the day after
an 80-year-old resident of the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn,
died from the virus, and three other cases were confirmed in
eastern and central Queens, several miles from the original
epicenter of the epidemic, near Whitestone and College Point.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was first confirmed on Sept. 2, and the spraying began
the next day. The first two deaths came last week, on Tuesday and
Thursday, at Flushing Hospital Medical Center in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, the number of confirmed cases had grown to six. On
Wednesday, it was nine.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are still awaiting lab results from about 60 patients
to determine whether they actually have the disease, and hospitals
throughout the region are closely monitoring people who complain of
symptoms ranging from persistent high fevers to severe headaches,
slurred speech, blurred vision and nervous ticks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fear spread along with the spraying on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving. I'm going to Nantucket,'' said Penny Dow, 39, a
video producer who takes her son, Gabriel, to play in Manhattan's
Riverside Park every afternoon. ``All you need is one mosquito to
bite your kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Lauren Lee, an independent filmmaker who lives on
Manhattan's Upper West Side, said she had lived through a similar
epidemic in Houston, and ``it was really oppressive the way they
sprayed the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God, you don't want all those horrible chemicals in your
child's lungs,'' Ms. Lee said as she pushed her son, Nick, on the
swings at the playground. ``We had play dates inside, but everyone
in Houston has big houses. Here, there's four of us in a small
two-bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sunset Park, where television cameras flocked to document
city workers handing out repellent and await the overhead assault
scheduled for evening, neighbors gathered on stoops to discuss the
growing epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``No barbecue tonight,'' joked Bert Anderson, 92.
</P>
<P>
   A few doors down on 44th Street, Asha Williams, 7, and Julian
Shaw, 6, were discussing the relative methods of pesticides versus
infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't kill Mother Nature,'' Asha said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Mother Nature does bad things to us,'' Julian countered.

JUST CALL JETS' KEYSHAWN JOHNSON THE ULTIMATE RECEIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Another Keyshawn Johnson era is about to begin
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bill Parcells knows he has a receiver who is destined
to redefine the position,'' Johnson said Thursday at the New York
Jets' practice.
</P>
<P>
   But do not mention Jerry Rice to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are just numbers: touchdowns and catches,'' Johnson
said, referring Rice's record career.
</P>
<P>
   What Johnson was alluding to is something he plans to unveil in
the season opener against the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been a presence this summer. He has been brutal on
linebackers, blocking them at the line of scrimmage. He has been
practicing with special teams. He has been intimidating defensive
backs.
</P>
<P>
   Afraid of getting burned on long throws, opponents have given
Johnson a cushion. And when they try to tackle him, Johnson has
been using a powerful straight arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm taking the role of wide receiver to a new level,''
Johnson said. ``I can do what the guys who run the 40 in 4.3
seconds can do. My whole thing now is to redefine the position.
It's a 70- or 80-catch guy. It's a 1,000-yard guy. It's someone who
can do it on special teams. I've been practicing there. Big guys
like me didn't run reverses. That was the little guys. Wide
receivers like me didn't beat up on linebackers who weigh 50 pounds
more.''
</P>
<P>
   For a reminder of what Johnson is capable of, just go back to
last season's playoff game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He had
a reverse for a touchdown, a reception for a touchdown, a fumble
recovery, an interception to foil a desperation pass and nine
catches for 121 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the off season my personal trainer at home told me you're
ready for the next level,'' Johnson said. ``My wife told me. Coach
Parcells told me. It means the way I am in the locker room, the way
I am off the field. It has to do with my new restaurant, with my
real estate interests, with all the venues.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, it has to do with his vision of himself as a Jet.
That has not dramatically changed since the team made him the
league's No. 1 pick over all in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it really does not matter to him that Wayne Chrebet, the
other starting receiver, will not be playing for the next six weeks
as he recuperates from foot surgery. Nor does it matter to him that
Dedric Ward will be the other starter, or that the Patriots have
cornerbacks named Ty Law and Steve Israel. Johnson has not caught
fewer than four passes in any of his six appearances against New
England.
</P>
<P>
   While Chrebet has justifiably earned a reputation as one of the
great third-down receivers in pro football, Johnson had almost as
many receptions last season (23) as Chrebet (26) had. And Johnson
also scored seven touchdowns on third-down catches to lead the
American Conference. It was part of a season in which he snared 83
passes, amassed 1,131 yards, scored 10 touchdowns and went to the
Pro Bowl. He could have done all this as a rookie in 1996, he said,
if only Neil O'Donnell had looked for him downfield.
</P>
<P>
   But with Vinny Testaverde, it is another story. Testaverde,
Johnson said, ``will throw the ball behind me off my hip if he sees
defenders are going to explode on me; Vinny knows I can turn and
catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vinny will throw it high,'' Johnson said. ``He knows there's
nobody in this locker room or around the league who can beat me to
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Johnson is employing his 6-foot-3-inch frame and 212 pounds
to try to do even more.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a second. Didn't Rice redefine the receiver?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Johnson said. ``At that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Johnson sees himself as the leader of a potential quartet
of big, physical players who will attack defenders: the Vikings'
Randy Moss, the Packers' Antonio Freeman and the 49ers' Terrell
Owens.
</P>
<P>
   To get to this level, Johnson has worked on areas that Parcells
noted needed improvement: his ability to catch the ball on the
sideline and stay in bounds, his separation from a defender going
deep, his skill at creating yardage after the catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who else can catch a 2-yard pass and make 10 yards out of it
with five defenders hanging on?'' Johnson asked.
</P>
<P>
   It did not seem like a multiple-choice question.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ If the Jets need a spare wide receiver against New England,
RAY LUCAS, a reserve quarterback, will be their man.
</P>
<P>
   _ ERNIE LOGAN moved up two categories of fitness in one day. On
Wednesday, the backup nose tackle day was given a 25 percent chance
of playing against the Patriots. On Thursday, the figure rose to 75
percent as the player recuperates from a calf injury. &QL;

HOUSE BILL WOULD SLIGHTLY EASE LAWSUITS AGAINST HMOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans on Thursday introduced a
comprehensive bill to regulate health maintenance organizations and
to protect patients, who would gain carefully circumscribed new
rights to sue health plans for injuries caused by the insurer's
negligence.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is expected to vote soon on the measure, drafted
at the request of House Republican leaders including the speaker,
Dennis Hastert. Given the divisive history of the issue in the
House, Republican and Democratic leaders were reluctant to predict
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the bill, Reps. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and John
Shadegg of Arizona, said it would allow patients to sue in federal
court to recover damages for genuine injuries, while making sure
the courts were not filled with frivolous claims.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Van Hillary, R-Tenn., a supporter of the bill, said, ``It
allows patients who have truly been wronged to have a jury trial in
federal court.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, congressional Democrats and consumer groups
favor a much greater expansion of the patient's right to sue. HMOs,
insurance companies, business groups and Senate Republicans oppose
any new right to sue, saying it would make insurance unaffordable
for many people.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats described the Coburn-Shadegg bill as a diversion,
meant to sabotage stronger patient protections. Those protections
are in a bill supported by most House Democrats and by a few
Republicans, notably Rep. Charlie Norwood of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn and Shadegg shared drafts of their bill with aides to the
speaker, but Hastert's office had no immediate comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican supporters of the measure urged the speaker to
endorse it Thursday. Otherwise, they said, House Republicans, under
pressure to make HMOs more accountable, might end up supporting the
Democratic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   That House Republicans are now trying to expand patients'
ability to sue HMOs shows how much heat the Republicans feel on
this issue, which has emerged as the most contentious of all
questions in the debate over how to regulate health insurance in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state judges have often allowed HMOs to avoid
liability for decisions on benefits. In the last two years, courts
have become more receptive to lawsuits challenging the quality of
care, but patients' rights vary from state to state, and many
judges have described the mix of federal and state laws as
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a bill on July 15 that would provide some
protections for a limited number of Americans in managed health
care plans. But it does not include any new right to sue. Graham
said the Senate measure was ``a woefully inadequate response to a
real problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, a physician, and Shadegg, a lawyer, stressed that the
right to sue was narrowly defined in their bill.
</P>
<P>
   Patients would be allowed to sue if they suffered physical
injury because of a health plan's negligence. Before going to
court, patients would have to exhaust the administrative appeals
process established by their HMO. This process would include review
by an outside panel of at least three medical experts.
</P>
<P>
   An HMO could be forced to pay damages only if it failed to
exercise ``ordinary care'' and made an ``incorrect determination''
that a service was not medically necessary or was not a covered
benefit under the terms of the health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Damages for pain and suffering would be limited to $250,000 or
twice the amount of any economic loss, whichever was higher.
Patients could not recover punitive damages unless a health plan
had acted with ``conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or
safety'' of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Employers who provide health benefits to their employees would
not be subject to lawsuits unless they directly participated in the
final decision of a health plan to deny a claim for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Hahn, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said the
bill was ``unacceptable, because it does not provide the consumer
with full compensation for injuries that result from the mistakes
of a managed-care plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald A. Danner, vice president of the National Federation of
Independent Business, said the bill ``would force most small
employers to stop providing health insurance.''

KATIE WEBSTER, BLUES AND BOOGIE-WOOGIE MUSICIAN, DIES AT 63  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, La, Calif.)   By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Katie Webster, the blues and boogie-woogie pianist and singer
known as the Swamp Boogie Queen, a mainstay of Gulf Coast
rhythm-and-blues recordings in the 1950s and '60s and a popular
touring artist in the '80s and early '90s, died on Sunday at her
home in League City, Texas She was 63.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said her daughter Elizabeth Vereen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webster, born Kathryn Jewel Thorne, was reared by musicians:
her father was a ragtime pianist who turned to gospel music when he
became a minister in the Sanctified Church of God in Christ, in
Houston, and her mother, who played spirituals and classical music,
was responsible for her keyboard training.
</P>
<P>
   She began her professional musical life early, although it was
not the sort her parents would have encouraged: at 13 she was
traveling the ``crawfish circuit'' from Dallas to New Orleans with
a jazz band. At 15 she married the pianist Earl Webster, and around
that time the guitarist and singer Ashton Savoy brought Ms. Webster
to south Louisiana to make a recording with him.
</P>
<P>
   This was the beginning of a studio career that would encompass
hundreds of records on Louisiana labels including Goldband and
Excello. She recorded with many of the area's best-known regional
musicians, including Slim Harpo, Lightnin' Slim, Clifton Chenier
and Guitar Junior. She played on the original version of ``Sea of
Love,'' by Phil Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 Otis Redding played at the Bamboo Club, the Lake Charles
bar where Ms. Webster's band the Uptighters often played. Redding
was so taken by the heavy and exact timekeeping of her left hand
that he hired her immediately; for the next three years she was
both his opening act and the pianist in his band. (She played on
such well-known Redding albums as ``Live at the Whiskey-a-Go-Go.'')
She was pregnant and on leave from the band in 1967 when Redding
undertook his final tour and died in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webster did not restart her career until 1982, when she
toured Europe for the first time; her hollering voice and her
charismatic innuendo-laden performances won her fans, and her
second act had begun. She performed in the San Francisco Bay Area
and around Europe through the 1980s and recorded for the Arhoolie
and Alligator labels, with Bonnie Raitt and Robert Cray showing
their support in guest appearances. A stroke in 1993 damaged her
playing and her eyesight, although she continued to perform
sporadically.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Vereen, of League City, she is survived by
another daughter, Audrey Johnson of Houston; two sisters, Earline
Allen of Houston and Irma Dews of San Pablo, Calif.; three
brothers, Cyrus, Robert and Cornelius Thorne, all of San Francisco;
eight grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.  &QL;

JAN GORBATY, POLISH PIANIST, DIES AT 84  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Poland, Russia, Austria, N.J. )   By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jan Gorbaty, a stylish, white-maned Polish pianist
with a patriot's zeal for the music of Chopin who founded the New
York chapter of the National Chopin Foundation, died on Monday at
his home in the Forest Hills neighborhood here. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Susan.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbaty was born in Wolochisk, Russia, in 1915, the son of a
wealthy supplier of horses and feed to the Czar's troops. But with
the revolution the family fled to Lvov, Poland, where Gorbaty gave
his first public performance at the age of 4.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the conservatory there, Gorbaty became a
prominent young teacher and one of the leading pianists in Poland
before World War II, which he survived under false identity papers.
In 1945 he moved with his wife, Judith Weiss, a classicist, to
Vienna, where he resumed his career and also studied with Paul
Weingarten, a pupil of Emil von Sauer, who in turn was a student of
Liszt.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbaty emigrated to the United States in 1950, making his debut
at Town Hall shortly afterward. Besides the standard repertory he
played music by living Americans and lesser-known Chopin acolytes
like Julius Fontana, a friend and pupil of Chopin's. But he was
best known for his Chopin recordings and performances.
</P>
<P>
   He taught at Rutgers University, New York University and at the
City University of New York, and he lectured frequently,
particularly on the Chopin mazurkas. In 1983 he founded the New
York chapter of the National Chopin Foundation, and in 1995 he
received from President Lech Walesa a Cross of Merit of the
Republic of Poland for furthering the understanding of Chopin's
music.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbaty's wife of 59 years died in March. He is survived by his
daughter, of Forest Hills.

<P>
   Alexi Ramov, a founder of the Northeast Regional Ballet
Association and the longtime director of the Ballet Guild of the
Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania, died on Sept. 2 at Manorcare Health
Services in Bethlehem, Pa. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Ramov, born Joseph E. Kowatch Jr., was a major figure in ballet
in Pennsylvania. He performed at Radio City Music Hall and with
companies including the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and the
Metropolitan Opera Ballet, before becoming active in ballet in his
home state. He founded the Northeast Regional Ballet Association
with Barbara Weisberger in 1959, and served five terms as its
president.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s Ramov became artistic director and resident
choreographer of the Ballet Guild of Lehigh Valley in Bethlehem, a
position he held until 1995, when he retired with the title of
artistic director emeritus. Ramov also founded the Scranton Ballet
Company.
</P>
<P>
   Ramov taught extensively at summer dance programs and schools in
the area, including the Sutton-Ramov School of Dance in Scranton,
Pa., which he directed with Jimmy Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sisters, Olga Anderson of East Orange,
N.J., and Margaret Walson of Allentown, Pa.  &QL;

EXCERPTS FROM PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from President Clinton's
statement on East Timor on Thursday at the White House and
questions and answers, as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   STATEMENT BY CLINTON
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENT CLINTON: Good afternoon. Before I leave on my trip for
New Zealand I wanted to say a few words about the trip and a couple
of other issues. These Apex summits started in 1993, when I first
invited the leaders of the Asia-Pacific region to meet in Seattle,
Wash. They bring together the leaders of more than half the world's
people and half its economic activity. What we do there will help
to decide whether the global economy continues to move in the
direction of greater openness and integration, equity and growth in
the next century.
</P>
<P>
   This year, one of my most important goals is to get a commitment
on the part of all our Asian-Pacific partners to a rapid
wide-ranging market opening, so that can launch a new trade round
at the WTO meeting in Seattle in December. We must stand together
against protectionism and for a common future of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   During the global financial crisis over the last two years, the
fact that the United States kept its markets open, bolstered Asia
and the world. It helped to keep the crisis from becoming even
worse and it certainly helped to turn it around.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was good for American workers, as you can see by the
continued low unemployment rate in our country. I will meet with
Prime Minister Obuchi and President Kim in Auckland to have the
opportunity to discuss not only economic issues, but also the
difficult issues surrounding our relationships with North Korea. I
will also meet with President Jung and with the new Russian Prime
Minister, Mr. Putin.
</P>
<P>
   We will be meeting following a difficult period in Asia. There
are encouraging signs of recovery from South Korea to Thailand to
Japan. There are also continuing difficulties, as all of you know,
caused by everything from economic distress to neglect of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are those difficulties more pressing than in Indonesia.
It is, first, the fourth largest country in the world and the
largest Islamic country. It has been undergoing an important
democratic transformation. It has the capacity to lift an entire
region if it succeeds and to swamp its neighbors in a sea of
disorder if it fails. Precisely because Indonesia's future is
important, I am so deeply concerned by the failure of its military
to bring a stop to gross abuses now going on in East Timor. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government and military are responsible for the
safety of the East Timorese and of the U.N. mission there. If
Indonesia does not end the violence, it must invite, it must invite
the international community to assist in restoring security. It
must allow international relief agencies to help people on the
ground. It must move forward with the transition to independence.
</P>
<P>
   Having allowed the vote and gotten such a clear unambiguous
answer, we cannot have a reversal of course here. The overwhelming
weight of international opinion from Asia to Africa to Europe to
North America strongly agrees with this position. Right now, the
international financial institutions are not moving forward with
substantial new lending to Indonesia. My own willingness to support
future assistance will depend very strongly on the way Indonesia
handles this situation.
</P>
<P>
   Today I have also ordered the suspension of all programs of
military cooperation with Indonesia, effective immediately. Our
military leaders have made crystal clear to senior military
officials in Indonesia what they must do to restore our confidence.
...
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. President, Republicans in Congress are saying that if you
veto their tax-cut package, they're not likely to send you another
one. Are tax cuts dead for this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, my bill is $250 billion, and it provides almost exactly
as much aid to middle-class Americans as theirs does. Whether there
is a bill, of course, is up to them. They can control what bills
come up. But if they're saying, ``Well, it's our way or no way,''
then that is evidence that this has been pretty much about politics
all along. I'm all about progress. I want to get something done.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to see us secure in modernized Medicare. I am willing
to work with them on the Social Security issue. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: About the FALN, the clemency's been accepted, but these
prisoners say they are political prisoners. They challenged the
restrictions on them. And your disagreement with the first lady _
can you describe to us how you discussed it with her on the issue
of clemency?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, first of all, let me discuss this issue on the merits,
so you know what happened. It came up, in what I would call the
ordinary course of business, from the counsel's office. And I
received a very detailed statement of the facts and the claims. I
was requested by hundreds of people, including President Carter,
Bishop Tutu and many other religious leaders and members of
Congress, to look at this and act favorably on it. And then,
obviously, there were those who disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   My judgment was that these people should be offered a
conditional clemency for two reasons. 1) None of them, even though
they belonged to an organization which had espoused violent means,
none of them were convicted of doing any bodily harm to anyone. And
2) They had all served sentences that were considerably longer than
they would serve under the sentencing guidelines which control
federal sentencing now. Most of them had been in for somewhere
around 19 years. They had served very long sentences for offenses
that did not involve bodily harm to other people.
</P>
<P>
   And because I did not believe they should be held in
incarceration, in effect by guilt by association, I agreed to offer
them clemency, if they would abide by the conditions of parole and
specifically renounce violence. What that means is if they get out
and they violate the conditions of parole, and particularly if they
are engaged in any way with people who are espousing violence, that
their parole will be revoked and they'll have to go back to prison.
So under those circumstances, I felt then and I still feel that
that was the just decision.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She didn't know anything about it until, as far as I know, until
someone from her office called and asked her for a comment, because
I did not discuss it with her. I haven't discussed other clemency
issues with her and I didn't think I should discuss this one. So it
was up to her, and entirely appropriate for her to say whatever she
wanted to about it. But I did what I thought was right, and it's
what I'll continue to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If your wife decides on a run for office, does she figure to
be hurt by what many people perceive as a flip-flop on the issue of
clemency for the Puerto Rican nationalists?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I, you know, they'll have to evaluate that as they
please. You know what she said in her statement. I don't know that
that's a flip-flop. I had a different position. I thought they
should be given another week. If in the course of this week, if we
had come to tomorrow and they hadn't taken it and I had revoked the
offer, would that have been a flip-flop by me? I don't think so.
But the reason I thought that they should _ the reason I felt they
should be given to this week is I knew that their lawyer was
actually physically going around to see all of them and would not
finish until, I think, yesterday. So I thought they ought to be
given that amount of time, and it's the judgment I made.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. President, what level of military support are you
prepared to provide to any peacekeeping mission? And what recourse
do you have if Indonesia continues to refuse an international
mission for East Timor?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, the answer to the first question is we're still _ we're
consulting with the Australians and with others and we're also
talking to interested members of Congress about this, and no
decision has been made. I want the American people to know two
things. No. 1, the Australians have made it clear that they, being
the nearest military authority, intend to play the largest role and
provide the lion's share of the effort there, and that many other
countries have already agreed to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   But secondly, the United States has been, certainly since the
Second World War, and indeed going back before, heavily involved in
the Asia-Pacific region. The Australians and many of these other
countries have been our allies in every difficulty that we have
faced. And I believe that we should support them in an appropriate
way. But that is something that would still have to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the second question you asked is the most difficult one.
There are any number of countries that are willing to support this
endeavor. There are any number of countries on the Security Council
who are willing to support it, if Indonesia will ask.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is we are in this interim period, where the East
Timorese have voted for independence. But East Timor is still a
part of Indonesia. And we are going through this transition period.
The frustrating thing to me, and I don't know how many phone calls
I've made the last three or four days about this, but the thing
that's frustrating people all over the world is they either can't
or won't stop the violence, which is leading people to leave. But
they don't want to admit they can't. So they don't want to ask
anybody else to come in.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why I have made the statements I've made today about
economic aid and military cooperation. I tried to do this with
telephone calls, working with others. I have seen the frustration
and the anxiety in the voice of the Portuguese Prime Minister and
any other number of leaders who are passionately concerned about
this area. And obviously Prime Minister Howard in Australia, Prime
Minister Shipley in New Zealand and others. We are doing our best.
Kofi Annan is doing his best. He sent a U.N. delegation there, and
they arrived there yesterday. So this may be a question that you'll
have to ask me again tomorrow and the next day and the next day,
because I don't have a clear answer for you yet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ... Have you thought of economic sanctions in Indonesia?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, first of all, I think today the right thing to do is to
make it clear what our intentions are. And our intentions are 1) to
stop military-to-military cooperation right now, until this matter
gets resolved, and 2) we have sent a clear signal about what we
will do on economic cooperation if it is not resolved. It would be
a pity if the Indonesian recovery were crashed by this. But one way
or the other, it will be crashed by this if they don't fix it. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: You left a big blank on what kind of response you're getting
from the Indonesian government. ...
</P>
<P>
   A: The reason I left a big blank there, the reason I left a big
blank there is that so far both the political and military
authorities have been unwilling. They have been very clear. They do
not want to ask for international assistance. Now that is subject
to one of two or three interpretations. Interpretation No. 1 is
they believe they can stop this madness in East Timor and they want
to do and they don't want to have to admit they have to have help
to do it. Two is nobody's got the authority to make a decision,
because it's chaotic there. They've already had a president
election and parliamentary elections. But they haven't, because of
the complex system for picking a new leader, they haven't done
that. Three is that at least some elements in the country support
what is happening in East Timor. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Freeh should resign?
</P>
<P>
   A I think Janet _ first of all, in terms of the merits of this
and the FBI. I don't have anything to add to what I said last week.
I think that she did the right thing in asking an outside person to
review it. I think that Mr. Freeh did the right thing in supporting
that. I think I've known Senator Danforth for, well, I met him when
President Carter was in office, sometime during that period, so
somewhere around 20 years. And I have always thought him an
honorable man and an intelligent and straightforward man. The only
thing that I would ask is that he conduct a thorough and honest
inquiry and do it as promptly as he can, so that we can get the
facts, take appropriate action and go forward. But based on what I
know of him and what I have observed, I think that's a good move by
the attorney general and I certainly don't think there's any reason
for her to resign. Thank you.

EDITORIAL: TOO SWEET ON SUGAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 10:
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, consumption of sugars and other caloric sweeteners
by Americans has risen nearly 30 percent. Twenty years ago,
children consumed twice as much milk as soda. Today the reverse is
true. This national appetite for empty calories is crowding out
important nutrients found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and
dairy products. It also contributes to rising obesity rates.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a coalition of concerned nutrition experts and
organizations, including the American Public Health Association,
urged the Food and Drug Administration to supply consumers who want
to cut back on sugar with important information that is not now
readily available to them.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, labels list only total sugars in a given product.
They do not say which sugar occurs naturally and which is derived
from an added ingredient like white or brown sugar, corn syrup or
honey. The group's petition asks the agency to set a recommended
daily intake for refined sugar, and then require that all food
labels disclose how much is in each serving, and what percentage of
the maximum daily intake that represents.
</P>
<P>
   These are modest steps with a potentially big payoff for public
health. The Agriculture Department's recommendation for a healthful
diet calls for limiting added sugar consumption to 10 teaspoons a
day. On average, Americans consume twice that amount. No doubt many
would be encouraged to modify their eating habits, and
manufacturers would be encouraged to modify their ingredients, if
there were greater awareness of the whopping amount of added sugar
some foods contain. A single 12-ounce can of regular soda, for
example, contains the Agriculture Department's recommended maximum
_ 10 teaspoons.

UCLA'S REPUTATION IS ON THE LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nine months ago, UCLA traveled to Miami with the
Fiesta Bowl and $12 million for the Pacific-10 on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Bruins depart for Ohio State without a New Year's Day
bowl game or millions of dollars in the balance. They're without 11
suspended players, they're starting 13 freshmen and sophomores,
they're 10-point underdogs and no one expects them to win.
</P>
<P>
   It may appear there's nothing on the line except Pac-10 pride,
but try convincing the Bruins of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the most important game of coach (Bob)
Toledo's era, even without the suspended guys,'' Bruins
All-American receiver Danny Farmer said. ``Times are down, and
people expect us to struggle. That makes it more important to show
what we've got.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last team we beat that wasn't from the West Coast was
Houston. We didn't beat Tennessee (in 1996 or '97). We didn't beat
Michigan (in 1996). We didn't beat Miami and we didn't beat
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance for us to make a statement. It's a chance for
the guys to prove who we are, because nobody expects us to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Bruins and the conference. After Arizona's embarrassment
at Penn State, after Stanford's humiliation at Texas and Washington
State's ineptitude against Utah, the Pac-10's national image is
worse than boxing's. It's the object of ridicule in Eastern press
boxes, weight rooms down South and among teams it used to dominate.
Last weekend, Utah quarterback Darnell Arceneaux compared
Washington State to San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Florida, where the powerhouses are, they think Pac-10 guys
don't have the urge to hit people,'' said UCLA receiver Freddie
Mitchell, a Lakeland, Fla., native who spent the summer in South
Florida. ``It's a sad impression.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory in Columbus won't alleviate Stanford's embarrassment
or propel Arizona into the national title picture. But it may help
vanquish lingering agony from the Miami and Wisconsin defeats.
</P>
<P>
   It may refute ESPN announcer Lee Corso's comment that UCLA's
defense spends its offseason surfing instead of weightlifting _ a
comment the obsessed Bruins reference time and again, like the Rain
Man and Judge Wapner.
</P>
<P>
   It may quiet the critics who laugh at the memory of Edgerrin
James and Ron Dayne rushing for one-third of a mile against the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   It may help recruiting, just as UCLA's 66-3 victory at Texas two
years ago helped convince Sean Phillips, a Parade All-American from
Missouri City, Texas, to sign with UCLA. The Bruins are recruiting
several players from the Midwest, including the nation's top
receiver, Charles Rogers, who will attend Saturday's game. (Newbury
Park tight end Will Svitek also will attend as Ohio State's guest.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We recruit against Notre Dame, Michigan, Tennessee and Ohio
State,'' Toledo said. ``It's important to play well against those
people. We're UCLA. People should respect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, that's what Saturday is about _ national respect,
regional respect, and self-respect. The Bruins don't play
Wisconsin, Miami, Tennessee or Michigan this season; they don't
have a chance to avenge previous defeats. Ohio State is the only
national power on the schedule _ the only chance for UCLA to prove
itself nationally and conquer the demons of Dayne and James.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reputation's at stake after the way things went last
year,'' Bruins safety Julius Williams said. ``We hear all the time
how soft UCLA is. We've just got to prove it's not true. This is a
chance for us to get a little redemption. It's been on my mind
since the first day of winter workouts.''
</P>
<P>
   And strength coach Mike Linn made sure it stayed there. From
January to July, Linn reminded the Bruins about Dayne and James and
the humiliating end to a historic season. When they lifted weights
in the chill of February dawns, Linn was in their faces, bellowing
about pain and respect and toughness. When they ran sprints under
the sweltering summer sun, Linn was in their faces, screaming about
anguish and guts and revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a bulletin board of every negative thing that had
been said about us over the years,'' defensive tackle Pete Holland
said. ``We'd be out on the field, dog tired, and he'd lose his
voice screaming at us. It gave us extra gas in our tank.''
</P>
<P>
   A former player (1989-91), Linn is painfully aware of UCLA's
reputation for being soft. He was excited when Toledo made
toughness a priority and hired renowned strength coach Kevin Yoxall
in 1996. A year later, the Bruins crushed Washington, their
longtime tormentor, then declared dead the era of ``Gutty Little
Bruins.'' It appeared the softness was gone.
</P>
<P>
   It was, but only on a regional scale. The Bruins are as mean and
tough as anyone in the Pac-10, but Miami and Wisconsin showed they
weren't quite ready for the national bullies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of those games as setbacks,'' Linn said. ``They
just woke us up, told us we aren't there yet. The thing I'm trying
to get in their heads is that until we beat Miami, Wisconsin, Ohio
State, Michigan or Tennessee, we're still going to be looked upon
as a West Coast team. And everybody says West Coast teams have
great skill players but can't play smash-mouth football.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt about Ohio State's game plan. The Buckeyes, who
watched videotape of UCLA-Miami and UCLA-Wisconsin, will ram the
ball into the heart of UCLA's defense until the Bruins stop it _ if
they stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were drawing (Ohio State's) game plan, I'd give it to the
tailbacks,'' Toledo said. ``We know that. We've just got to stop
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only then can UCLA's healing begin.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 12)  
 (af)  
 By DEBORAH STEAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stack of beautiful shirts on the cover of Roger Rosenblatt's
book about why Americans buy (and buy and buy) is exactly right. A
visual reference to ``The Great Gatsby'' _ specifically, the moment
in the novel when Jay Gatsby tries to woo Daisy Buchanan by heaping
his exquisitely tailored blouses on a table _ it neatly sums up
both the style and the substance of the subject matter within.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consuming Desires: Consumption, Culture and the Pursuit of
Happiness'' (Island Books, $24.95) is a dazzling stack of essays
itself, finely observed and thought-provoking over all. It examines
what its editor calls ``the painful and thumping heart of the
rapacious American appetite.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt, an essayist for Time magazine, has assembled 13
writers: economists, novelists, short-story writers, journalists.
The idea is to figure out what's frantic and what's sensible about
consuming, and to reflect on the cost of our national spending
spree.
</P>
<P>
   True, Rosenblatt notes in his useful and literary introduction,
consumption has long been a particularly American activity. But
these days, he writes, ``ordinary citizens are becoming like the
big spenders of the past, going on near-desperate hunts for new
stuff to buy and to long for.''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining this, he says, the book's essays yield two main
thoughts. One is that our consumption is driven by an inchoate,
unsatisfied yearning for family love and for community. The other
is that our striving Western _ especially American _ sense of self
demands outer expressions of individualism.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the essayists bring up the idea of longing. Edward
Luttwak, a critic of what he calls ``turbo-capitalism'' at home and
abroad, considers the buying frenzy (with consumer debt at 89
percent of household income in 1997) as a misery indicator.
Purchases temporarily repair the wounds arising from repeated job
relocations, fractured families and isolation, says Luttwak, an
expert in both military affairs and economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are emotional destitutes,'' he writes, ``as poor in
their family connections as are Afghans or Sudanese in money.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is our frantic consumption of popular culture and
style as a substitute for real community connection. Films have
always been a binding force for our economically and ethnically
disparate population, explains the critic Molly Haskell, adding
that in the movies, characters can ``consume without the tedium of
labor.''
</P>
<P>
   And looking at the apparent paradoxes in suburban and hip-hop
fashion, Alex Kotlowitz, who often writes about race and poverty,
says poor, black, urban teen-agers aspire to Coach wallets and the
outdoorsy look of Ralph Lauren as a way of belonging to the larger
society. Their white, middle-class counterparts, trying to be edgy
at a safe distance, affect an inner-city style _ huge, low-slung
jeans and unlaced high-tops.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gesture of commercialism, Kotlowitz says, ``that in the
end only accentuates and prolongs the myths we have built up about
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   As for that Western sense of individuality, Juliet Schor and
Bill McKibben each write convincingly about the Americanness of
acquiring things for comfort or cachet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schor, a women's studies professor at Harvard, repeats some
of the theories she expounded in her 1998 book, ``The Overspent
American.'' But they bear repeating here. Identity in America, she
argues, increasingly depends on prestigious brand names. And who we
are, or think we are, has little to do with keeping up with the
Joneses these days. It's about identifying with people on the upper
rungs of the socioeconomic ladder _ the boss, say, or characters on
television dramas, or celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   McKibbon, who often writes about the environment, says his
identity, too, is defined by consumerism _ in his case, the
rejection of it. In a witty meditation on black flies and other
hardships of rural living in upstate New York, he comments on the
``catechism'' of the consumer society (``the elevation of each one
of us above all else'') and jokes about his voluntary simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   He writes that he feels ``special'' because of his wreck of a
car, his old clothes and because ``it's a 20-mile round trip to get
a quart of milk.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``Consuming Desires'' goes beyond the ideas of
identity and yearning. In one delightful essay, the writer Bharati
Mukherjee wickedly exults in a trip to the mall. In another, the
novelist Jane Smiley muses on the link between feminism and
consumerism. It all began with housework, she argues
entertainingly, describing the history of labor-saving gadgets in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   There's even something for a book reviewer _ a complaint by
Andre Schiffrin, editor in chief of The New Press, about the
quality of the books we consume today. Nonfiction, especially, has
suffered under the new economic order in big-time publishing, he
argues.
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly true when it comes to business titles, where
such bottom-line thinking has produced its share of junk: books
written as advertisements for consultants, books that promise quick
riches, books that glean ``management lessons'' from sports, war,
nursery rhymes, the life of Jesus Christ _ books, in other words,
with the most slender or silliest of premises. ``Consuming
Desires,'' published by a small press, is a welcome exception.

the countdown to midnight and bottles of champagne.
</P>

   ``We've already planned who will be here; they have already been
notified and have agreed to come in,'' Jurczyk said. ``I'd say we
will start the prime rib parties again next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurczyk's firm is ahead of many companies. Though most have
tested and retested computer networks to head off problems when the
calendar rolls over to 01/01/2000, few companies responding to a
recent informal survey had yet to determine which employees should
be in the office on the big night. And even fewer had thought about
how to reward those who work through the most ballyhooed New Year's
of a lifetime _ or how to punish those who don't show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view Y2K as a computer issue anymore _ it's a staffing
issue,'' said Jeff Joerres, chief executive of Manpower, the
temporary employment company. ``Even if your company doubles a
$7.50-an-hour salary, if you are going to miss the best party of
your life with your buddies, the decision isn't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies as diverse as Starbucks in coffee, Aflac in insurance,
REI in outdoor gear and Southwest Airlines said that their staffing
plans for Dec. 31 were not yet in place.
</P>
<P>
   At Lucent Technologies, the communications equipment maker, the
computer testing is virtually complete. But as to who will be at
work, ``we are deciding what level of staffing we need,'' said Lynn
Newman, a spokeswoman. A retinue from the technology staff will
posted in two dozen countries around the world, but salespeople may
also be required on site, or at least on call, to calm nervous
customers. ``We know this is a unique event,'' Ms. Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies did not want to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a comprehensive Year 2000 plan in place, but we are
not at liberty to discuss details,'' said Brenda Dempsey of J.M.
Smucker, the jelly maker.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they are talking, many companies anticipate a
barrage of late-night inquiries from the news media, especially if
something does go wrong, so public-relations people like Ms. Newman
of Lucent are being told not to make other plans.
</P>
<P>
   And some public relations agencies are gearing up, too.
Burston-Marsteller is promoting its ``special global communications
network of 24 Y2K Communications Command Centers that will be
staffed by Y2K-dedicated crisis managers throughout the millennium
weekend.'' Those crisis managers are actually existing staff
members. The company said that hundreds of its workers volunteered
for such duty and would receive a ``nominal bonus,'' but that
clients would not be charged extra.
</P>
<P>
   Manpower expects extra demand for temporary workers at call
centers, to field inquiries about product breakdowns, and for data
entry workers to re-enter any lost computer data. Employees at its
own headquarters who work that night will receive bonus pay and
gift bags with Year 2000 novelty items and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   At Pinkerton, the security business, the focus is more on
contingency planning. Security guards will receive digital cell
phones, in case ordinary phones fail, and have been told to be
ready for a long watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be prepared for the possibility that their
replacement may not arrive,'' said Mark H. Leaf, a company
spokesman. Clients set the guards' pay, but Pinkerton has suggested
that a holiday bonus is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies that plan to schedule employees who don't usually
work over the New Year's holiday simply expect them to show, with
or without extra compensation. Pacific Gas and Electric, the big
utility, said that while it expected no outages, hundreds of extra
employees would be on duty to handle any problems, all at regular
pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not seeing any resistance to people working,'' said
Lyman Shaffer, manager of corporate security for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Spellane, a spokesman for the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, said the union did not mind. ``You work in that
industry, it comes with the turf,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, unless there is a contract specifying otherwise,
employers are within their rights to insist that employees work New
Year's Eve, said James A. Pabarue, an employment and labor lawyer
in Philadelphia. ``The bottom line is, if they pay you, you have to
show up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many companies think that sweetening the pot may lower
the absentee rate, or at least head off resentment. MBNA, the giant
credit card issuer, will bring in meals and hold drawings for
prizes like TV sets and bicycles, said Brian Dalphon, a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo Bank, whose main staffing worry is New Year's Day,
not New Year's Eve, will offer to put up workers in hotels near its
trust division offices in Minneapolis and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft will pull out the stops in several departments.
``There will be a couple of New Year's Eve parties here _ no
alcohol, of course _ and people can bring their wives and kids,''
said Don Jones, a director of Year 2000 readiness for the company.
His division of about 300 employees will have a live band, dancing,
videos for children and a catered dinner. What's on the menu? ``I
don't know,'' Jones said, ``but I know it's expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said regular employees would be there to help the company
handle any glitches, although they expect none. A champagne-free
party will fill their time, he said, because ``it would be horrible
for morale to have people sitting around doing nothing.''

ONE ENVELOPE. ONE VOTE.  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By EDWARD C. STEPHENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I own a few shares of stock, so from time to time, I sign pieces
of paper known as proxy forms.
</P>
<P>
   The task has not been particularly arduous. I take the big
envelope out of my mailbox and, while still standing in my doorway,
find the proxy form inside, sign it and date it. Then I put it in
the enclosed envelope and drop it in the outgoing mail. I pride
myself on the quick turnaround; I may be the fastest proxy voter in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Proxy forms generally come with a thick annual report or other
comprehensive information about the company. I save all this
material because it looks important and expensive. But I don't have
to read it because I always vote with management.
</P>
<P>
   After all, these handsome people look like they know what they
are doing (to prove this, their photographs are often included in
the annual reports), and they are paid handsomely to do it right.
I, for one, am not going to second-guess them. And voting with
management means that you don't have to understand the often
cryptic phrases that accompany the boxes on the proxy forms.
</P>
<P>
   I think that the proxy system works fine; I also like to think
that my efficiency in voting has helped the stock prices of my
holdings to climb.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the system doesn't need fixing. But, apparently, it
has been fixed anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I own shares in General Electric, which now lets
its shareholders cast their votes on line. GE may prefer that I
vote in this new, improved way, but I think that it poses problems
and delays. First, I have to get to my computer; that means
stepping away from my mailbox and walking to the other end of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   There, I may have to wait on my daughter or my wife to finish
using the computer. And if there is a thunderstorm in the area, I
won't use the machine for fear of a dreaded power surge, and GE
must wait until the weather clears. (Note that the Postal Service
operates during rain, sleet and thunderstorms.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, I have to get to the Web site for voting,
www.proxyvote.com. Finding Web sites is not my strength; I have to
find the search engine, then type the address in.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after I land at the proxy site, here is what confronts me:
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Please select one of the links below ...
</P>
<P>
   If you received your proxy material in the mail, please have
your material and your control number ready.
</P>
<P>
   If you received a notification via E-mail, please have your
control number and personal identification number ready.
</P>
<P>
   To submit your voting instructions over our secure site, click
HERE.
</P>
<P>
   If your browser cannot support secure transactions via SSL
encryption, click HERE.
</P>
<P>
   Need to update to a security enabled browser? Click HERE.(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have trouble keeping track of the remote control for the TV,
let alone knowing a control number or personal identification
number. I do not know what SSL encryption means. I would not know a
secure site if I fell into one. And I do not understand why all of
this is necessary for me just to say, ``I vote with you guys.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another of my holdings, AT&AMP;T, has come up with its own
improvement in proxy voting, involving the telephone. But that,
too, involves finding lots of numbers somewhere in the papers I've
been sent.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where my voting instructions are, so I don't know
my 12-digit control number. And why 12 digits, anyhow? I don't even
know the toll-free phone number is, but it is bound to be at least
11 digits. That's 23 numbers already. Mastering this process could
make you hate yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Companies tell me that I'm a valued shareholder, and that my
vote is important. But the next time I receive proxy material, I'm
going to vote against management.
</P>
<P>
   I have nothing against these good-looking, well-paid people, but
they ought to leave well enough alone. &QL;

 (af)  
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OJAI, Calif. _ You heard it here last: The Plymouth Prowler is a
way cool set of wheels.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing pros have been wringing favorable publicity out of
Chrysler's modern interpretation of a 1950s hot rod ever since it
was introduced in 1993 as a concept car on the auto show circuit.
And by deliberately managing to keep it a scarce commodity _ fewer
than 4,000 have been made since ecstatic baby boomers started
lining up to buy them in 1997 _ the Prowler has retained all of its
gawk value.
</P>
<P>
   What you probably haven't heard much about, though, is what's
behind that pretty face. After driving a Prowler for a week on the
highways and byways of Southern California, my opinion is mixed.
With the sun shining, the top down and teen-agers squealing
approval from the curb, the Prowler has a lot going for it. But
with the claustrophobic cloth roof in place, wind noise drowning
out the CD player and the steering resisting my fantasy of being in
charge of a lithe roadster, it's hard to see why so many are eager
to spend $40,000 for so little.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the high notes. In the flesh, the Prowler looks even
better than it does as a centerfold. The huge 20-inch rear wheels,
superwide track, exposed front suspension and venetian-blind grill
give the car a street-fighter feel. I don't even mind the plastic
front bumper that looks like a mustache painted on by Salvador
Dali.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm downright enthusiastic about the paint job. The first
Prowlers came in any color you wanted as long as it was purple,
with complementary dashboard accents. The palette has expanded to
yellow, black, red, and, for the 2000 model, silver. I drove a
shimmering black car, which was impractical for a dusty desert
climate, but worthy of the Batmobile.
</P>
<P>
   On a different front, the Prowler's keepers obviously heard the
early grumbling that their pet project was long on bark and short
on bite. They replaced the 214-horsepower V6 of the 1997 model with
the 253-horse, 3.5-liter aluminum V6 in the Chrysler 300M sport
sedan. Car and Driver magazine reported that the new engine cut a
full second off the car's zero-to-60 mph time, to a
better-than-respectable 6 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But horsepower is no cure-all. The Prowler experience turns a
touch sour the minute you open one of the oversized doors. Or
rather, try to open one. The door manages perhaps a narrow
30-degrees of entry angle, which probably saves the doors from
dings in tight parking slots but make it almost impossible to plop
into the deep bucket seats with any grace.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, the six-way manually adjustable leather driver's
seat is comfortable. And the steering wheel tilts to make space for
thighs crafted by Stepmaster. However, the radically tapered front
wheel well leaves inadequate room for one's left foot.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the end of the ergonomic deficiencies. The limited
view over the high dash does not include the front wheels. And the
controls are laid out oddly. The steering column-mounted tachometer
is retro and kinda cute. But the speedometer is placed far to the
right, just above the radio.
</P>
<P>
   With the top in place, the passenger cabin feels very, very
small. And getting the top down is not a trivial exercise,
requiring a half-dozen operations to unfasten the balky front
snaps, pop open the rear deck compartment, lower the two-piece top
and lock all the moving parts into place. All this is a pain,
especially if it has just started to pour.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody every judged a street rod by the placement of
the dead pedal or the fit of the ragtop. The fun is supposed to
begin when you turn the key.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed it does. The exhaust makes a lovely noise, a throaty
rumble with the faint sound of valves worthy of the Leader of the
Pack. Unfortunately, though, the fun ends almost as soon as it
begins.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way to pop the clutch to produce a squeal of rubber,
because there's no clutch: The Prowler comes only with a four-speed
automatic. Daimler-Chrysler does equip the car with AutoStick, a
gadget that allows you to run through the gears at a touch of the
shift lever. But AutoStick, with its relatively sluggish response
time, is no substitute for the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Prowler's handling is adequate, but no better. With its
stiff (some would say harsh) suspension, wide track and incredibly
fat tires you would expect the Prowler to eat curves for breakfast.
But the steering is surprisingly leaden, especially in view of the
very light 2,840-pound curb weight. And while it never let me down,
the handling never gave me the confidence to push the Prowler very
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the problem of the brakes. Well, not exactly a
problem, but certainly no asset. They required excessive pedal
pressure, and the stopping distance seemed long for a car so light.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Prowler is an odd package: great to look at, yet
merely competent as a road car and no pleasure on the freeway.
Great to look at, yet merely competent as a roadster. It comes with
its share of amenities: air-conditioning, power windows and locks,
cruise control, run-flat tires and a passenger-side air bag that
can be disabled to accommodate children.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 model (I drove a 1999) will have even more: a rear-view
mirror that dims automatically, a radio that adjusts the volume
level to background noise, a trip computer and a somewhat softer
ride. But no amount of gussying could transform the Prowler into a
worthy highway cruiser. It's too noisy and too bumpy, and barely
has storage capacity for the owner's manual.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest drawback is the $40,000 sticker price. For
that much money (or much less) there are any number of gorgeous
performance cars out there to choose from _ everything from the new
Honda S2000 roadster to the dazzling Audi TT to the
not-so-plain-old 3-Series BMW. &QL;

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 12)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Recurring reports of Plymouth's demise have proved
wildly exaggerated. Still, some new nails have been pounded into
the coffin of Plymouth, the DaimlerChrysler Corp. brand aimed at
budget-minded customers, and it seems increasingly likely that the
patient will be allowed to quietly expire.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, company officials insist that they do not plan
any imminent obituary for Plymouth, which dates to 1928 and was
long known along with Chevrolet and Ford as one of the ``Low-Priced
Three.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Plymouth name has disappeared from the back end of
2000-model minivans. DaimlerChrysler says the badge was removed to
save money _ although the Voyager or Grand Voyager script remains _
in this, the last year for the minivan's current design.
</P>
<P>
   And DaimlerChrysler has eliminated all but one option package _
one that costs only $705 _ for Plymouth's most popular minivan, the
Grand Voyager SE. Company officials say that they are trying to
refocus Plymouth on entry-level minivan shoppers. At the same time,
the price of the least-expensive Chrysler Town &AMP; Country was cut
nearly $1,500 for 2000 to compete better in the increasingly
competitive high end of the minivan market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an anomaly to have Plymouth, our dedicated entry brand,
selling a $26,000 to $27,000 minivan against Honda and Toyota,''
Martin Levine, DaimlerChrysler vice president in charge of
Chrysler, Plymouth and Jeep, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significantly, DaimlerChrysler has curtailed the
sale of Plymouths, except for the Prowler, in Canada; all Dodge
models except for the Viper have also been banished from Canada.
Levine said the elimination of Plymouth and Dodge from Canada last
spring, a move that coincided with the arrival of the 2000 Neon,
was done to limit product duplication in showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of Canadian DaimlerChrysler dealers sold all
Chrysler brands. (The Neon continues to be sold there as the
Chrysler Neon, as it is in all overseas markets.) ``The action was
taken for network efficiency,'' Levine said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In January, DaimlerChrysler announced that the eye-catching 2001
PT Cruiser, a retro cross between a minivan and a 1930s Ford
delivery wagon, would be sold as a Chrysler even though it would be
priced below $20,000 _ territory typically given to Plymouth. Given
the attention the PT Cruiser has garnered, it would also have given
a much-needed lift to Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   But, Levine said in explaining Chrysler's strategy, ``we don't
see the PT Cruiser as an entry-level product.''
</P>
<P>
   The Plymouth name currently appears only on the Neon (which is
virtually indistinguishable from the Dodge version), the Voyager
and Grand Voyager minivans, the Prowler and the Breeze, a midsize
sedan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler is said to be considering whether to continue
the Breeze after its siblings, the Dodge Stratus and Chrysler
Cirrus, are redesigned for 2001. It is also unclear whether
Plymouth will get a version of the next-generation minivan for
2001. DaimlerChrysler officials decline to discuss future products,
but they concede that Plymouth is competing in market segments that
have gone cold. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace is shifting to more upscale vehicles,'' Levine
said. ``Plymouth is focused on entry level, and the only part of
the entry-level business that has improved in the last year are
what we consider sub-entry models _ the heavily discounted Kia and
Hyundai vehicles from South Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler killed off the Eagle brand in 1998. DaimlerChrysler's
marketing structure would make it easier to eliminate Plymouth than
Dodge, because dealers for the Chrysler/Plymouth Division would
still have Chryslers to sell. Dodge has its own division with and a
distinct dealer structure. While Plymouth advertising has been
pared, Dodge is beginning a new campaign and Chrysler is kicking
off a marketing push this weekend with tailgate parties around the
PT Cruiser at college football games.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the first seven months of 1999 totaled 184,027 for
Plymouth, down 5 percent; 192,281 for Chrysler, up 8 percent;
321,068 for Jeep, up 18 percent, and 919,663 for Dodge, up 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though the future of the Dodge and Chrysler names seems secure,
and Jeep is seen as a corporate jewel, the Germans who make
decisions at DaimlerChrysler may be puzzled by the existence of so
many nameplates. The former Daimler-Benz did nicely with just one:
Mercedes-Benz. &QL;

 GIANTS' No. 1 QUARTERBACK HANDLES 2nd-STRING QUESTION  
 (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It was Feb. 19 and the New York Giants
had just given quarterback Kerry Collins a $5 million signing bonus
and a four-year contract that would pay him another $11.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Graham was on a family vacation at Disney World when he got
the news. He didn't exactly feel like part of the magic kingdom any
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was livid and felt betrayed. It took a lengthy telephone
call from coach Jim Fassel to calm him down. Graham knew what
everyone else suspected: that Collins would get every chance _
maybe every advantage that $16.9 million can buy _ to win the
starting quarterback's job between February and the season opener
Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said that wouldn't happen. The most remarkable story of
the preseason is that it hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, would add: yet.
</P>
<P>
   At concession stands next to the Giants' training camp practice
fields in Albany, N.Y., in August, a handful of numbered game
jerseys with players' names on the back could be bought by fans.
The most popular item was a Jason Sehorn No. 31 jersey.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one quarterback's jersey available: Collins' No.
5.
</P>
<P>
   The company that makes the game jerseys for public sale did not
think it was prudent to mass produce a Graham jersey, so it has
not.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Collins are aware of all these details. They have
also seen national football publications spend an entire Giants
preview article discussing Collins' chances of leading the Giants
to the playoffs, as if Graham were an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand how these things work,'' Collins said. ``But I am
not the starter. We all bought into this from the beginning, which
has made things a lot smoother. Kent's the starter. And I'm leaving
it at that for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to say anything else, and I have no desire to,
immediately causes all kinds of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham would agree, but not surprisingly, he is the most
skeptical about how secure his position really is. He remains
positive in every conservation, never using the words ``room for
error,'' even if he knows he has little of it.
</P>
<P>
   Graham had a steady and sometimes spectacular preseason, so it's
easier for him to dwell on how he can continue to thwart the
perception that inevitably, Collins will start.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, there's always the contract disparity between
the two _ Graham earns $1.1 million annually, or about one-fifth of
Collins' signing bonus. And there is Collins' notoriety as a
college all-American, a top draft pick, an early success in the
National Football League, and later, a famous failure.
</P>
<P>
   If Graham wanted to get away from, or forget about, any of that,
it hasn't been possible. There have been few days during the
preseason when Graham has not been asked about how he is handling
the situation with his backup.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's predecessors with the Giants, Dave Brown and Danny
Kanell, never faced those questions. Both were replaced by their
backups in midseason by Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   Graham has handled this with aplomb and patience. But Thursday,
he nonetheless said: ``Let's face it, it's still a unique
situation. I know we have to win early. I still have a lot of
prove. That's obvious. You're only as good as your last game.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, who took on the risk of a quarterback controversy when
he gave his assent to the signing of Collins, said Thursday that he
has never regretted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thought about the ramifications more than me,'' Fassel
said. ``But I had a conviction about this. Kent was the starter and
Kerry was the backup. I believed things would play out as they have
so far.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of the perception that Collins is still the
starter-in-waiting?
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected that, too,'' Fassel said. ``I expected people to
say that Kent is a career backup. Kent can prove them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Giants are hardly taking sides. Kent and Kerry
are both accepted, but Kent is the leader of the offense until he
shows he can't lead it. It's understood what would happen then.
Fassel has not taken long to react if he decides his quarterback is
holding back the team.
</P>
<P>
   Graham accepts those terms. As if he had any choice.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, happy to be out of the spotlight for a while, is
waiting his chance. Whenever it comes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Graham and Collins, at ease with each other despite
the peculiarities of their relationship, spend almost all of their
time together at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Some quarterback controversy.  &QL;

The clean-looking '49 Ford was developed by an industrial designer,
George W. Walker, from a job applicant's design. The '49 Ford was
sleek and daring by the standards of the day; it set benchmarks for
styling and packaging, and it proved to be a hit with a car-buying
public that was hungry for anything new from an industry that had
curtailed production during the war, then started anew for 1946
with the old prewar designs. (New York Times Photo)

Reform and Conservative movements last week began a large,

explain liberal Judaism to Israelis. (Rina Castelnuovo/New York

 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like a beagle baying at an unseen moon, fifth-seeded
Gustavo Kuerten howled at the airplanes strafing through the mist
that cloaked his U.S. Open quarterfinal match on Thursday. He
talked to his racquet in Portuguese, he tore at his coppery curls
and wore such a thick mask of zinc oxide that he resembled a
cartoon varmint. He applauded his unseeded opponent's most vicious
volleys like a paying customer and celebrated a few of his own
zingers by jumping around like an over-caffeinated Jimmy Connors.
</P>
<P>
   And when Cedric Pioline connected with a spectacular running
forehand pass that put him ahead by 10-9 in the third-set tie
breaker, Kuerten dropped his racquet, genuflected and moved over to
Pioline's side of the court to pay his respects with a handshake.
That's his version of man-to-man combat.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten, who turns 23 on Friday, had youth on his side and,
unlike the well-seasoned Frenchman across the net, an inspirational
Grand Slam trophy on his mantel at home in surf-happy
Florianopolis. But with Pioline _ a 30-year-old two-time Grand Slam
runner-up who reached this event's finale in 1993 _ rolling toward
the net like a Mack truck at every opportunity, Kuerten finally
succumbed to the pressure, 4-6, 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (16-14), 7-6 (10-8).
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten, who tried and failed to become the first Brazilian man
to make it into the Open semifinals, won the entertainment stakes
by acclamation inside the half-empty Arthur Ashe Stadium, where the
fans chanted his nickname as if they had entered a trance and booed
each time his big, shiny black sneaker drew a foot fault. But
Kuerten failed to reach his first Grand Slam semifinal since his
breakthrough at the 1997 French Open.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline described his winning tactics this way: ``I tried to
come in, go to the net, come in and put the pressure on his
shoulders, don't let him play his game what he likes to play, and
it worked. I was like smelling which side he was going to make the
passing shot on.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing in the first round of four of his last five Grand
Slams, Pioline began his comeback in a bizarre way in the first
round of this one when the two-time defending champion Patrick
Rafter, hampered by shoulder pain that was later diagnosed as a
rotator-cuff tear, defaulted to give Pioline a 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5,
1-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline's flawless performance in three tie breakers _ on which
Thursday's quarterfinal rose, fell and turned _ improved his 1999
record to 26-9 in tie breakers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kuerten equaled Pioline ace for ace with 19, the
Frenchman guarded the net like a Doberman, and too many of
Kuerten's looping passes barely found their way over it before
being crushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's unbeatable, especially me; I'm still growing,
improving my game,'' said Kuerten, whose sunny disposition was
unspoiled by the outcome. So far, all five of his titles have come
on clay, the surface that allows him time to settle into a rhythm
and topspin his opponents into submission.
</P>
<P>
   While Kuerten hoped his quarterfinal finish at Wimbledon _ a
leap that moved his longtime coach, Larri Passos, to shave his head
in homage _ would bode for a better finish here, he had to settle
for an entertaining run to the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a little frustrated because I really played well, I
should have deserved to win, maybe,'' said Kuerten, the man whose
beefed-up serve put the four-time champion Pete Sampras out of
commission with a herniated disk in his lower back the day before
the Open started.

<P>
   Instead of winning, Kuerten saved seven Pioline-owned set
points, only to squander three of his own in the third set's tie
breaker, then blew three more set points in the critical fourth-set
tie breaker. A swashbuckling backhand volley took Pioline to match
point at 9-8, and Kuerten surrendered the quarterfinal with a shrug
and a blooping forehand error.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-hour-22-minute contest began on a beach day, under a hot
haze reminiscent of Kuerten's island headquarters, but by the time
they had ventured into the fourth set, the stadium lights were
cranked up high and a light rain had started to make the court
slick. Pioline slipped and fell twice, and in the 10th game Kuerten
requested a visit from the trainer, who later rubbed hot cream into
his fatigued legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the control of the match in the beginning,'' said
Kuerten, who kept his topspin so penetrating early on that Pioline
couldn't vacate the baseline for the net. ``I let it escape. Then I
was fighting, hanging on, trying to do my job, trying to get all
the chance if I had it, but I didn't get it. That was critical for
the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten also was haunted by a few questionable calls on an
increasingly dim day. ``I had a passing shot to win the second
set,'' he said. ``For me, it was good; for the line umpire, it
wasn't. Maybe for us in Brazil, for sure it was good. If it was in
Brazil, this tournament, maybe I have a chance to win more than
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten relinquished the second set with a most unpopular double
fault. His first serve was nullified by a foot fault, and his
second, designed to be an ace down the middle line, was ruled wide.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kuerten called the atmosphere of their quarterfinal
``great; we were hitting unbelievable shots,'' he refused to
handicap Pioline's chances of advancing further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nostrodamus,'' he said. ``It's wait and see.'' &QL;

FOSTER KEY AGAINST OHIO STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The offensive line wasn't solely responsible for
UCLA's sputtering running game against Boise State. The running
backs _ especially tailback DeShaun Foster _ had something to do
with it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't scrimmage DeShaun a lot (in training camp), and it
showed,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``He didn't keep his pad
level down, and he carried the ball loose.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Bruins to survive Saturday's date at Ohio State, their
young line (two freshmen and a sophomore) must create running
lanes, and Foster must improve his 3.2-yards-per-carry average.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of balance. The running game is the only way to
take pressure off inexperienced quarterbacks Drew Bennett and Cory
Paus. If the Bruins can't run, Ohio State will double-team
receivers and smother the aerial attack.
</P>
<P>
   What indicates an effective running game? If the Bruins gain 4
yards or more on half their attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a goal we always have,'' Toledo said. ``It keeps us in
sync with the game plan. If you only get 1 or 2 yards, then you're
facing second-and-8, second-and-9 or third-and-9.''
</P>
<P>

 WHEN WORK BITES BACK _ MOSQUITO-BUSTER KEEPS BAY AREA LIVEABLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID LAZARUS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO -- The big red Hovercraft glides across the water off
Redwood City, Calif., and comes to a halt in the soft mud of the
salt marsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Careful,'' warns James Counts, who oversees field operations
for the San Mateo County Mosquito Abatement District. ``The mud
there will come up to here on you.''
</P>
<P>
   He holds a hand near his chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to fall in without anyone around, you'd never get
out,'' Counts observes.
</P>
<P>
   This is about the most dangerous aspect of standing at the front
lines in the San Francisco Bay Area's war on mosquitoes. Aside from
getting bitten and stung a good deal more than most people,
mosquito warriors work in relative safety.
</P>
<P>
   And anonymity. It can be said that officials of the Bay Area's
10 mosquito-abatement districts hold some of the most
underappreciated, thankless jobs around _ especially when you
figure that their efforts are about the only thing making this
moist, mild region habitable by noninsects.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day, Counts removes his helmet and
demonstrates how to jump from the Hovercraft into the nearby
pickleweed, the thick, tangled plants that only become visible when
the tide is out.
</P>
<P>
   His ride-along visitor, decked out in heavy, waist-high rubber
boots and &LR;   &LR; assorted layers of yellow rain slickers, stumbles along
behind him. Even with the sun hidden by morning haze, it doesn't
take long to work up a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's physical work,'' Counts says as he makes his way to a
small pool of water left by the receding tide. ``On a typical day,
I might walk five, six miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the pool, Counts dips a plastic cup connected to a long
handle and proceeds to carefully examine the contents. He spills it
out and takes another sample from the other side of the pool, again
gazing intently at what he's found.
</P>
<P>
   ``No larvae,'' he announces, satisfied, and leads the way back
to the Hovercraft. There are plenty more samples to be taken on
this inspection tour.
</P>
<P>
   The San Mateo, Calif., district covers about 166 square miles
running from Millbrae, Calif., to Menlo Park, Calif. It's also the
nearest mosquito-abatement district to San Francisco, which has no
full-time mosquito-prevention program and thus relies heavily on
San Mateo's efforts to keep the mosquito population in check.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, San Mateo boasts the state's oldest mosquito-fighting
endeavor, launched in the Burlingame, Calif., area nearly a century
ago. At the time, according to a county report, mosquitoes ``would
literally form dark clouds overhead and make human habitation
almost intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   This still would be the case, Counts says, without continuing
countermeasures. ``Most of our work is preventive,'' he points out.
``If we didn't do it, you'd be eaten alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He wipes the visor of his helmet with a paper towel. The
Hovercraft kicks up a lot of spray as it skims the water and muck.
Counts, who races motorcycles in his spare time, guns the engine as
he leans into a turn.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, successful mosquito abatement is something most
local residents take for granted. Counts, 50, applied for an
opening with the district on a whim and now has been doing it for
almost three decades. He pulls down about $28 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the field work,'' Counts says as he parks the
Hovercraft and casts his eyes over hundreds of acres of open
marshland. He has the dark complexion and rough skin of a person
who works outdoors for a living. ``If I was a park ranger, it would
be pretty laid-back,'' he says. ``This is much more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe just a little frustrating, at least in terms of
receiving recognition for a job well done. ``People don't realize
that we're constantly out here doing this,'' Counts says. ``They
think we need mosquito control like we need lion control.''
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head. ``You try to explain to people, and they
think you're just blowing air.''
</P>
<P>
   Counts takes another reading. He stares into the plastic cup for
signs of mosquitoes-to-be. ``So far, so good,'' he says, spilling
the contents back out.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MOSQUITO (42683 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The Peninsula has a variety of mosquito species. At this time of
year, the Western house mosquito _ Culex pipiens, to scientific
types _ gets much of the attention by slipping into homes at night
and feasting on people as they sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these little fiends emerge from catch basins, fountains
and other urban locations, and district workers have to move
quickly to track down breeding sites before a situation grows out
of control. They use a number of abatement methods, ranging from
toxic (to a mosquito) substances to introduction of bug-chomping
fish.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid expansion of Silicon Valley has only made things
worse. More homes and offices means more drainage, more catch
basins and, naturally, more mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest threat, however, remains the coastal wetlands, which
give birth to the aggressive salt marsh mosquitoes Aedes squamiger
and Aedes dorsalis. The eggs of these two can remain viable in the
mud for as long as 20 years awaiting optimal hatching conditions,
and a full-grown salt marsh mosquito is capable of flying about 50
miles in search of fresh blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there are tons of eggs out here just waiting for
the water,'' Counts says as he takes another sample. ``We can't do
anything about them. The eggs have a protective coating.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick to mosquito abatement is nailing these suckers at the
larval stage. That's why Counts and his crew regularly check known
breeding grounds, watching for sudden spikes in larvae (and wearing
plenty of repellent during peak seasons).
</P>
<P>
   When found, the team often will attack with all-terrain
vehicles, spraying nearby pools. Expansive areas will be addressed
by helicopter. And for hard-to-reach spots, Counts will heft a
40-pound backpack and spray infested areas on foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he says while trekking back to the Hovercraft,
``more people die every year from mosquitoes than anything else.
We're lucky to have a program. In some Third World countries, they
lose thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, with malaria no longer much of a going concern,
mosquitoes are essentially pests. But district personnel have their
hands full battling assorted other pests falling under their
jurisdiction. They tackle yellow jacket nests, not to mention Lyme
disease spread by ticks, hantavirus spread by rodents and plague
spread by a number of creatures.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robert Gay, manager of the San Mateo district,
hantavirus was detected late last year in mice on San Bruno
Mountain. It was found again this spring near Crystal Springs
Reservoir, closer to residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   If inhaled by a human, hantavirus causes a high fever and the
lungs to fill with fluid. Death can result within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, district workers are still in surveillance mode
and are educating members of the public how to dispose of mice
droppings without stirring up dust, which is how hantavirus usually
jumps to humans. There are no plans yet to try to control the
rodent population throughout the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   And so it's the mosquitoes that remain a central focus of the
district's labors.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of hours traversing the marsh, Counts finally
steers the Hovercraft back to shore. He has taken dozens of samples
and turned up no larvae. This was expected. Things will start
hopping, or buzzing, once the rains start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' Counts says, ``you want to go after some yellow
jackets? We can put on the moon suits. It's nice. People are really
grateful when you come to their home and take out a nest.''
</P>
<P>
   His visitor decides to pass. Moon suits notwithstanding, going
to head to head with hundreds of angry yellow jackets isn't how he
wants to spend the remainder of the day.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of MOSQUITO (42683 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Counts nods and loads the Hovercraft back onto a truck trailer
for the short trip back to headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He figures he has climbed about as high as he will go in
mosquito abatement. The next step up the career ladder would be to
become a supervisor, but that would mean riding a desk instead of a
Hovercraft. Counts couldn't imagine having to remain indoors all
day.
</P>
<P>
   He says he might put in another 10 years with the district
before retiring in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the mosquitoes like in New Mexico?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't yet know,'' Counts says, smiling slightly at the
prospect of bugs to come.

EDITORIAL: HELPING EAST TIMOR, AND INDONESIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 10:
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out for Indonesia to disarm and disband the
army-backed militias that have rampaged through East Timor for the
past week, killing hundreds of people and sending thousands into
hiding and exile. The violence subsided somewhat Thursday. But
unless Jakarta can bring these militias to heel in the next few
days, which is unlikely, an international peacekeeping force will
be needed to save lives and make sure that the results of last
week's referendum approving independence for the province is
respected.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's consent is needed for such a force to function
smoothly. That will require strong pressure from Washington.
President Clinton applied some Thursday, announcing the suspension
of military ties with the Indonesian Army and emphasizing that
American support for future economic assistance will hinge on
Indonesia's performance on the East Timor issue. He should be even
more explicit and declare that billions of dollars in international
loans will stay blocked until President B.J. Habibie accepts
international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Washington wants to save lives in East Timor without derailing
Jakarta's transition to democratic government. This fall, a
partially elected assembly is scheduled to choose Indonesia's next
president. That would complete what, for all its deficiencies,
would be the most democratic selection process the world's
fourth-largest country has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   American policy can advance both objectives at the same time.
Democracy can take root in Indonesia only if its armed forces defer
to civilian authority and respect election results. In East Timor,
Indonesia's army is doing neither.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's independence referendum was organized with the
approval of Habibie, who promised to abide by its result. But a
significant faction of Indonesia's army fears that independence for
East Timor could encourage secessionist movements elsewhere in
Indonesia, and is therefore trying to subvert the referendum by
creating so much chaos that Habibie will be forced to reverse
course. If this succeeds, it would demonstrate that the military,
which has ruled Indonesia for the past 34 years, remains the real
power no matter who wins the presidential election. Many senior
officers also oppose an international peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian democracy requires that the armed forces obey
civilian authorities in Jakarta. East Timor's safety and freedom
require that Jakarta agree to international peacekeepers.
Washington should use every lever at its disposal to make sure that
both requirements are quickly fulfilled. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 10:
</P>
<P>
   The naming of former Sen. John Danforth to conduct an
independent inquiry into the FBI's disastrous 1993 siege of the
Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, is a promising
development. The need for such an inquiry has been obvious from the
moment the FBI acknowledged, after six years of firm denials by the
agency and Attorney General Janet Reno, that it had used incendiary
tear-gas canisters during the siege.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, R-Mo., has a strong background in law enforcement and
a reputation among his former Capitol Hill colleagues for balance
and honesty. His congressional record was blemished by his overly
zealous defense of Judge Clarence Thomas during the tumultuous
Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1991. Danforth at the time
seemed more interested in painting Anita Hill as a possible
psychopath than getting to the bottom of her accusations of sexual
harassment by Thomas. A lot now rides on Danforth's ability and
determination, in his new role, to avoid the lack of objectivity
that marked his performance in that regrettable episode.
</P>
<P>
   We believe he will be able to do so. At a news conference
Thursday, Danforth correctly identified the two key questions his
investigation needs to answer. Was there a cover-up, and did the
actions by federal officials in deploying the tear gas canisters
result in the conflagration in which about 80 people died? The
evidence made public so far does not refute the government's
contention that the blaze was set by the cultists themselves. But
the official version needs to be rigorously tested in light of the
damage to public confidence when key evidence in FBI files gets
overlooked and the American people are misinformed by the FBI
director and the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   As for this week's call by the Senate majority leader, Trent
Lott, and others for Reno's resignation, we sympathize with the
sentiment. Her initial decision to attack the compound was rash,
and Lott is correct in saying that her credibility has been badly
undermined by the six-year lag in disclosing key evidence about the
debacle contained in FBI files. Her failure to fully investigate
campaign finance abuses by the Clinton administration was a
flagrant dereliction of duty. But for the sake of getting to the
bottom of the Waco mess, it is far better now to have Reno remain
in office and therefore subject to public and Congressional
pressure to cooperate fully with Danforth's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Danforth has taken the job, Congress should put off its
own investigations to avoid any harmful interference with his
inquiry. That is the responsible course chosen by the chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, Henry Hyde. It would be helpful for
other would-be investigators in the House and Senate to follow his
lead.

 &HT;    Agassi and ecstasy
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A person is ready for change after hitting bottom _
or reaching the top, only to feel empty about it. The new Andre
Agassi was ready twice-over.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago today, Agassi played Pete Sampras in a U.S. Open
final that was the best of men's tennis in the 1990s. It was No. 1
against No. 2, the sport's pre-eminent superstars at the height of
their powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That summer, I won 26 matches in a row going into the finals,
beating Pete two of the three times we played that year,'' Agassi
said this week. ``I was tired, real tired. You always want to bring
your best in the biggest of situations, but I found that I
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi lost that 1995 match 6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, and his deepest
wound was psychological. It prompted him to conclude that ``the
emotional investment in tennis wasn't worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just crushed,'' Agassi said. ``Nothing else really
seemed to mean a whole lot to me the rest of the year. I carried
that on for a couple of more years.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, Agassi was ranked outside the top 100 and
groping for inspiration. Starting from the time he was 13 and
shipped off to Nick Bollettieri to lead a life of fame, Agassi had
played the game out of a fear that he would never realize how good
he was if he didn't stick to the grind.
</P>
<P>
   So he figured it was time for something else. In April 1997,
Agassi wed Brooke Shields, his girlfriend of four years. His first
tournament after the honeymoon was in Atlanta, and he lost in the
second round to Magnus Norman and stormed off, not talking to the
press and incurring a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis still irked him, but home life was idyllic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing a lot of golf, going out a lot, enjoying
Brooke's world,'' Agassi said. ``It was awesome, and I miss it. It
was nice not to have the responsibility I've known since I was a
child.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's tennis career bottomed out a few months later. Perhaps
it was that October, when Agassi lost in the first round to Todd
Martin in Stuttgart, Germany. His coach, Brad Gilbert, gave his
plump pupil a speech saying, essentially, ``You're a shadow of
yourself. Play or don't play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met a lot of people in my life, but Andre's got the most
God-given talent I've ever seen,'' said Gilbert, who joined the
Agassi entourage when Bollettieri, similarly fed up, abandoned him
in 1994. ``Sometimes, you expect the most from him and he gives you
the least. Sometimes, when you think there's no way he could show
you this again, he can reach back and grab magic like nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's comeback is well-chronicled. It started humbly with a
pair of USTA Challenger minor-league events, one in his hometown of
Las Vegas. The plan was simple: ``Work in the gym, work on the
track, work on the court and work on the knife and fork,'' he has
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game didn't leave me,'' he said. ``I fell because I wasn't
in shape. I knew I could address that.'' In fact, Agassi is a
well-muscled spectacle at the Open, attracting a couple hundred
spectators daily at practice to watch him hit bare-chested.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's real challenge was finding some meaning in tennis.
Agassi credits Shields, Gilbert and Gil Reyes, his longtime trainer
and perhaps his best friend. ``He can live with disappointment, but
not regret,'' Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the media played a role, Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the position of being in the media focus quite a good
one,'' said Agassi, a view not shared by many other former
child-star athletes. ``It gives me an objective platform to take a
good look at myself, without actually having to take it
personally.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the criticisms was that Agassi was a symbol for
superficiality. Agassi now regrets the slogan ``Image is
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gradually, it dawned on me,'' he said, ``that maybe I should
focus more on my responsibility than on my hopes, that I had an
obligation to make the most of what's been given to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, it came together when Agassi won the French Open and
gave men's tennis a tremendous boost. NBC's ratings for the final
were up 43 percent from the previous year as Agassi became the
fifth player in history to win each of the four majors in a career.
</P>
<P>
   Then at Wimbledon, site of Agassi's first and most unexpected
major title, in 1992, Agassi met Sampras in a showdown reminiscent
of the 1995 U.S. final. Agassi lost again _ but without anguish.
</P>
<P>
   The one irony in the Agassi revival is his divorce from Shields
during the spring, 10 days before their second anniversary. Agassi
called her minutes after winning the French and says both were
crying, but he adds, ``Love is not enough for a marriage to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Agassi is one victory from returning to the U.S. Open final
for the first time since 1995. No matter what happens this year,
Agassi thinks his roller-coaster of a tennis career is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thank God I have the opportunity still in my career
to be out here enjoying it this much, because I've spent many a
time fighting myself, fighting pressures that I put on myself,''
Agassi said. ``Tennis has my focus, and it will until I can't do it
anymore.''

 &HT;    Williams sisters continue to draw
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Venus and Serena Williams can fill up Armstrong
Stadium for a doubles match Thursday, imagine the atmosphere this
afternoon when the big four of women's tennis _ the sisters,
Martina Hingis and Lindsay Davenport _ meet in the semifinals of
the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The old stadium now holds about 9,500, and it was 80 percent
full as the Williams sisters beat Monica Seles and Mary Joe
Fernandez 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cedric Pioline was beating Gustavo Kuerten 4-6, 7-6,
7-6, 7-6 in the men's quarterfinals to a lesser audience inside
cavernous Arthur Ashe Stadium until the sisters were done and there
was a spill-over effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly,'' Venus said. ``If you saw something good, wouldn't
you want to be in it? I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams plays Davenport in the first semifinal at 1:30
p.m., or after the men's doubles final. Serena has beaten Davenport
in two of their three meetings, including a 6-4, 6-2 victory at
Indian Wells last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Though Serena is seeded only seventh, even the fourth-seeded
Seles admitted losing to her Wednesday was no upset. ``The top four
girls right now are playing a bit above,'' Seles said. Or as Serena
put it, ``If you're playing Serena, even on a bad day I'm tough to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus, who'll play Hingis at 3:30 or following the first
semifinal, was asked who'd win if she and the world No. 1 were both
playing their best. ``Me,'' she said. ``If I'm playing my best,
it's tough, guys. Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis holds a 7-3 lead in the series and beat Williams 6-4, 6-0
last month in the San Diego final. No sisters have played each
other in a major final this century.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline makes men's semis
</P>
<P>
   Pioline won three straight tiebreakers in beating Kuerten. The
second tiebreak went to 16-14, and one of Pioline's winning
forehand winners impressed Kuerten so much that he crossed over to
his side and shook his hand. ``I couldn't believe it, so I
congratulate him,'' said Kuerten, who had six set points through
the tiebreakers. Unseeded, he's one victory from his third major
final. The others were the '93 U.S. Open and '97 Wimbledon. Pioline
will player the winner of the Todd Martin-Slava Dosedel match in
Saturday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek record amended
</P>
<P>
   Upon further review, Richard Krajicek's record for most aces in
a match is 49, not 48.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Levin, statistician for the USA Nework, reviewed the tape of
Krajicek's match Wednesday against Yevgeny Kafelnikov and found
that the umpire had neglected to change his card after a let call
was overruled for an ace.
</P>
<P>
   Bhupathi, Paes in hunt
</P>
<P>
   Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes will attempt to win their third
straight Grand Slam tournament doubles title today when they play
Alex O'Brien and Sebastien Lareau in the 11 a.m. men's final.
Bhupathi and Paes won the French Open and Wimbledon and made the
Australian final.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the early
front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, on
Thursday began posting on his Internet site a detailed list of the
size and source of every contribution to his campaign, a gesture of
voluntary disclosure that campaign finance experts said was
unprecedented in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   While the Federal Election Commission requires all candidates to
provide such information shortly after the end of each quarter _
and the government itself posts it on the Internet _ Bush said that
his campaign would update the details of its fund-raising daily. A
short time lag will occur, however, between the receipt of a
donation and its appearance on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The information Bush's aides posted on Thursday covered
contributions through two weeks ago, or Aug. 26, and although it
did not provide a total for those donations, aides said the figure
was slightly more than $49 million, a record-shattering sum.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that the daily Internet postings underscored his
support for more openness in the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans will be able to look for themselves to find out who
is helping to fund my campaign,'' Bush said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But several advocates of changes in campaign finance laws said
that the Bush campaign was also making a canny public relations
move amid clear public concern about the influence of money in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   These advocates said that Bush was specifically trying to
counter criticism that his presidential campaign was a financial
steamroller, driven by the wealthiest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realizes that there's negative reaction to how much money
he's raised and he's trying to take the sting out of it,'' said
Ellen Miller, the executive director of Public Campaign, a
nonpartisan group that promotes an overhaul of the current system
for financing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller noted, for example, that Bush's campaign was even
going beyond federal requirements by posting information about
people who donated less than $200. She said that the decision was
clearly an effort to create the impression that small donors have
contributed to Bush's windfall, when big donors have truly made the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Aides for several other candidates said they did not expect to
follow suit with what for them would amount to a time-consuming and
arduous effort.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Bush said visitors to his World Wide Web site,
www.georgewbush.com, would get a full, accurate picture of his
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they will find is that their friends and neighbors,
grass-roots people in every state in this nation, are responding to
my message of prosperity with a purpose by sending in $20 or $50 or
$100 or a maximum of $1,000 to help elect me president,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised so much money so quickly that he has already
decided not to seek federal matching funds for the Republican
primaries, freeing himself from or to be bound by spending limits
in pivotal primary states.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki Moore, a spokeswoman for Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic front-runner, who has not raised as much money as Bush,
cited that decision in dismissing Mr. Bush's daily Internet
postings as more symbol than substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a token gesture,'' Ms. Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor to Bush's Web site can see, on a seemingly endless
alphabetical inventory, that Mary Abel, a retiree from Temperance,
Mich., gave Bush $25 on Aug 16 and that Joseph Zito, a United
Parcel Service vice president who lives in Prospect, Ky., gave him
$1,000 on July 22.
</P>
<P>
   But the information is not organized in a fashion that permits a
quick tabulation of the number of donors or speedy analysis of who
they are. Advocates of new campaign finance regulations said that
Bush could have chosen a more accessible format.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it's great that they're revealing it,'' said
Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics. ``This is setting a new standard.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Makinson added, ``The format that they're using makes it
impossible to do anything but scan names. They want to make it look
like the Bush campaign is being supported by grass-roots people all
over the country. The reality is that those donors don't count for
much.''
</P>
<P>
   A rough review of the new data from the Bush campaign suggested
that since July 1, when the new quarter began, Mr. Bush has added
more than 30,000 donors to the roughly 75,000 donors as of June
30th. Most of these people, the review showed, gave less than $200.
</P>
<P>
   But those small donations represented less than 10 percent of an
estimated $12 million that Mr. Bush added to his coffers between
July 1 and Aug. 26. Donations of $200 or more accounted for
slightly more than 90 percent of that total.
</P>
<P>
   That was consistent with the trend of giving through June 30th.
Ms. Miller said that an analysis of funds raised before then showed
that 92 percent of Bush's funds came in increments of $200 or more.
She said that 89 percent of Gore's money came in such increments.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Bush, said the campaign did not
anticipate that any donors would object to the release of his or or
her name before the end of a mandatory reporting period. The
current period ends on Sept. 30, after which all the candidates
will provide detailed donor information accessible on various
Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal election law, individuals can contribute no more
than $1,000 to a campaign. Political action committees can
contribute up to $5,000, and while PAC's are not usually big givers
during the presidential primaries, they fattened Bush's campaign
coffers by $213,222 from July 1 through Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bush received money from many Congressional PAC's, including
committees affiliated with Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, chairman of
the House Republican Conference, and Sen. Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bush also received contributions of $5,000 from PACs
associated with Ashland Inc.; Bracewell &AMP; Patterson, a large Texas
law firm; Credit Suisse First Boston; Delta; Mass Mutual; National
Semiconductor Corp.; Sinclair Broadcast Group and Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed raising the individual contribution limit,
which has remained unchanged for a quarter of a century, to $3,000.
He has also said he supports banning some kinds of soft money _ the
largely unregulated contributions to political parties _ but not on
as broad a level as a bill pending in Congress would.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's total fund-raising tally has clearly exceeded $50 million
by now, although aides would confirm nothing beyond the Aug. 26
figure of $49,250,000. The previous record was set by Bob Dole, the
Republican presidential nominee in 1996, who raised $31.3 million
over an 18-month period leading up to the election.

FAIR TOWN'S FEAR GROWS WITH E. COLI CASES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, N.Y. _ Barbara Jones' 6-year-old son recently came
down with a fever and diarrhea. A week ago, she said, she might
have responded the way she always has: Take his temperature
regularly and give him plenty of fluids. But this time she
panicked. ``I was worried that this was life or death,'' she said.
``It terrified me.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, her son was fine, but her response was simple
enough to understand. A few days ago, a child who came to the
Washington County fair here died in one of the nation's worst
outbreaks of E. coli bacteria, and parents in this small town have
not been the same since. Like many of her neighbors, Mrs. Jones and
her family spent the weekend here at the fair and are now suddenly
realizing that they could be facing a health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people suspected to have been infected by E. coli
bacteria has grown to 497 cases, the State Health Department said.
Health officials said that two vendors at the fair might have
spread the bacterium to another fair, in Rensselaer County,
although no cases had yet been reported there.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak has claimed the life of a 3-year-old child, Rachel
Aldrich. The strain involved, known as O157:H7, is typically found
in undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized milk or contaminated
water. With adults, it usually causes only stomach problems, but it
can be fatal in children or older people.
</P>
<P>
   News of the outbreak has led to widespread concern among the
people of this town of 4,000. It is evident in places like the
Country Kitchen, a diner where the talk has been about the state of
the food and drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who come in here have been very worried,'' said Barbara
Smith, a waitress. ``My mom called me when she heard about this
because she knew that we liked to go to the fair each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kuzmich, who owns a construction firm, said that he and
his wife had gone to the fair, as they had in previous years,
mostly to sample the food _sausages, onions and peppers.
</P>
<P>
   He said they had not given it a second thought until a couple of
days ago, when they watched the local television news describing
the outbreak. ``I ran to the calendar and asked my wife, `What day
were we there?' '' he said. ``It turned out that we were fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept asking each other, `How are you doing?' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine A. Smith, a spokeswoman for the Health Department, said
that the outbreak peaked last week and that the spike in cases
represented a lag time in reporting. ``What we believe we are
seeing is the influence of people who suffered mild symptoms
earlier on and waited to see their doctor. Only now are their cases
being reported by their doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those who have come down with E. coli infections, 51 have
been hospitalized, she said, and 8 of those patients are on kidney
dialysis. Most of those infected were in Albany, Saratoga,
Washington and Warren Counties.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Joan Robertson, who took her two, 7-year-old grandchildren to
the fair, said she panicked when she heard about the outbreak, even
though she had packed a lunch of juice, sandwiches and fruit. A few
days later, she said, she called her son, the father of the girls,
to tell him to keep an eye on them. But all the while, she felt a
great sense of guilt about the episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frightening,'' she said. ``I was terrified that
something happened to them.'' In the end, she said, ``they were
fine. But it was very scary. I felt responsible that I had done
harm to my two grandchildren.'' &QL;

 BLACK BAPTISTS HEAR FORBES BUT ARE MiXED ON HIS VIEWS  
 (bl)  
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes
brought a message of conservative economic, social and political
values to the nation's largest African-American Baptist
organization, and the reaction was decidedly mixed.
</P>
<P>
   After rousing gospel music and inspirational preaching, Forbes
took to the podium and, in more subdued and methodical tones, laid
out his case for lower taxes, school vouchers and changes in Social
Security. And he told the tale _ meant as an inspirational message
_ of how his grandfather came to America as a penniless immigrant
and became a millionaire many times over through hard work.
</P>
<P>
   But the story was less well received than other parts of his
talk.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Earl Jones, pastor of the First Calvary Church in
Brooklyn, said: ``My grandfather has been here since 1850. We are
not billionaires. We're still working. It's not a question of hard
work, but opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jasper Williams Jr., pastor of the Salem Baptist Church
in Atlanta, added: ``It's like he was trying to identify with the
issues of the struggle. But I wasn't impressed. He wants to make us
feel that we could all be millionaires and that's not the real
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' speech was a sidelight to a larger four-day convention
in Tampa of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., which Thursday
elected the Rev. William Shaw as president. Shaw, of Philadelphia,
replaces the Rev. Henry Lyons, who earlier this year was convicted
on charges of racketeering and grand theft.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12,000 members of the convention heard Forbes' speech
Thursday. For Forbes, the event was high in publicity value and an
effort to show that a conservative Republican could relate to a
black and largely Democratic audience that has provided a forum for
nearly every presidential candidate since Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major event,'' said Randy Tate, president of the
Christian Coalition, in an interview. ``What Steve recognizes is
that conservatives can reach out and expand their base without
betraying their core principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. William Snorgrass, pastor of the Progressive Baptist
Church of Kansas City, Mo., pointed out that traditionally, the
group has heard more from Democratic politicians than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that Republicans are not interested in us,''
Snorgrass said. ``We've extended invitations to both. Sometimes we
feel the Democrats take us for granted but at least they show up.
And we'd like to hear from both.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who inherited the magazine publishing concern Forbes
Inc. from his father, Malcolm Forbes, came to the convention to try
to build a more broad-based coalition across ideological
boundaries, said his traveling press secretary, K.B. Forbes, who is
no relation.
</P>
<P>
   But others questioned whether appearances such as this one would
help Forbes at his next political hurdle _ making a good showing in
the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, where his target audience is
Republican and largely white. ``This is not a vote-rich environment
for Forbes,'' said a Republican analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Forbes, an Episcopalian, equated education with
civil rights, saying, ``A good education is a civil right and a
passport to economic freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   In arguing in favor of school vouchers _ which would provide aid
to allow parents to send their children to private schools _ Forbes
said: ``No mother in America should be forced to send her child to
a lousy school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we find big government politicians standing in the
schoolhouse door to keep children trapped in dangerous and failing
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   He also restated several of his campaign themes: allowing
younger workers to have private retirement accounts instead of the
traditional Social Security benefits and reducing taxes across the
board.
</P>
<P>
   These views garnered a mixed response. The Rev. Henry Holmes,
pastor of the Higher Dimensions Baptist Church in Vero, a lifelong
Democrat, has invited Forbes to visit his region. ``It appeals to
me when he talks about economic empowerment for minorities,''
Holmes said. ``Over the last six years, the wealthy have gotten
wealthier and the gap has spread.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Rev. John D. Kelly, pastor of Elyton Missionary Baptist
Church in Detroit, favored school vouchers as a way to pressure
public schools to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Others had their doubts. Williams of Atlanta felt that
inner-city schools should be improved overall but that school
vouchers would hamper that effort.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of tax cuts, Jones of Brooklyn questioned whether
big tax cuts would lead to cuts in government programs.

BLACK AND HISPANIC OFFICERS FILE SUIT AGAINST NEW YORK POLICE
DEPARTMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group of city police officers filed a lawsuit
against the New York Police Department Thursday, charging that
black and Hispanic officers are more harshly disciplined than white
officers and asking that a federal judge order sweeping changes in
the way the department polices itself.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by 14 officers and the Latino Officers
Association, an advocacy group that has been a harsh critic of
Police Department policies in the past, and has sued the department
in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   The group's president, Sgt. Anthony Miranda, who is among the
plaintiffs named in the suit, said that the case would soon be
expanded to 30 officers. The suit also asks that a judge declare it
a class action on behalf of the more than 5,000 Hispanic and 6,000
black officers on the police force, which has almost 39,000
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Police Department is famous for saying, `This is an
isolated case,''' Miranda said at a news conference, referring to
disciplinary actions against black and Hispanic officers. ``But
when we bring the total of all these isolations together, we have
systemic discrimination, systemic retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir refused to discuss the suit
Thursday. ``The NYPD does not comment on the merits of pending
litigation,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Safir added: ``It is well known, however, that the Latino
Officers Association has filed numerous lawsuits against the
department. This is a group with a political agenda primarily
interested in media attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The 43-page lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
asks a judge to remove the police discipline process from the
department's control and to appoint a federal monitor to oversee
the process. It also seeks compensatory and punitive damages,
</P>
<P>
   The discipline of black and Hispanic officers brought up on
departmental charges has been a simmering issue in New York for
years, spurred in part by the Latino Officers Association's
complaints of a double standard. Last year, a task force appointed
by Safir concluded that minority officers were more likely than
white officers to face punishments in the police discipline
process, but that the disparity was not the result of
discrimination. The department has contended that more minority
officers have been disciplined because they were involved more
often in serious infractions that carry mandatory penalties.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's suit cited repeated examples of what it called
such disparate treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said that one Hispanic officer, Ruben Malave, a 15-year
veteran, was dismissed from the force last October after he was
charged with being unfit for duty, allegations that included being
intoxicated and soliciting a prostitute while off duty. Malave was
dismissed even though he entered an alcohol rehabilitation program,
the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claimed that white officers who had engaged ``in much
more egregious conduct'' had not been dismissed. They included
officers who were caught on videotape having sex with prostitutes
while on duty, an officer who beat up a cab driver while
intoxicated, and officers who had been involved in drunken driving
accidents.

EDITORIAL: THE FULL SECOND AVENUE SUBWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Sept. 10:
</P>
<P>
   New York City began construction of its subway system 100 years
ago, a fact that should not surprise any veteran customer,
especially those using the old Lexington Avenue line along
Manhattan's East Side. The oddly designated green line is too often
excessively dirty, noisy and hot. Its cars are groaning with so
many passengers that City Councilman A. Gifford Miller complained
this week at a press conference before a City Council committee
hearing that ``if the subway represents the arteries of our city,
the Lexington Avenue line is about to cause us cardiac arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   The strain on the system worsens when the passenger load
increases, a problem that could occur under a five-year capital
plan being considered by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
The MTA is expected to propose building a tunnel connecting the
Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal, an idea favored by
Gov. George Pataki, who also controls the current MTA board. This
new tunnel could overload the already overcrowded Lexington Avenue
line, but instead of building an additional full line along Second
Avenue on the eastern side of Manhattan, the MTA board is
considering a truncated Second Avenue line that would stretch only
from 125th to 63rd street. Called ``the stub'' by critics, this
shortened line would send trains over the N and R tracks at 63rd,
producing a partial solution to a longer-term need for relief along
the East Side.
</P>
<P>
   The authority, which is expected to approve a new five-year
capital plan at its next board meeting in less than three weeks,
should endorse the full Second Avenue line, even if it still needs
to find the funds, to help balance the passenger load that will be
created by Pataki's new tunnel from the suburbs. This full line
would feed into financial and residential pockets of lower
Manhattan, supporting new economic growth with an expanded subway
system.
</P>
<P>
   Both projects are expensive. At least $4 billion would be needed
for the LIRR connection and up to $15 billion for the subway, which
means the lobbying for federal, state and city funds is still a
crucial part of any future package. But these additions are a down
payment on the city's growth. As one transit advocate said
recently, New York has used up the transportation system built by
its grandparents. It is time now to start constructing a route or
two for the grandchildren. &QL;

 &HT;    `Catfish' Hunter was at home in Hertford
 &HT;    By Will Sullivan
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERTFORD, N.C. _ A family lost its father, its husband and its
brother Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A nation lost one of its best baseball players.
</P>
<P>
   And a town lost its favorite son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy Hunter was Hertford, and Hertford was Jimmy,'' said
childhood friend Charles Woodard. ``They were synonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   From the folks that knew him best to casual acquaintances around
town, everyone in this community was touched by the man who
traveled all over the country, but never really left Hertford.
</P>
<P>
   And even in death, Hunter seems destined to make a difference in
the place he called home.
</P>
<P>
   After all, reminders of his incredible achievements are
everywhere. There's the monument outside the courthouse, an
engraved chunk of granite commemorating Hunter's dazzling Hall of
Fame career, the 224 wins, the five world series championships, the
Cy Young award and the perfect game in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   There's the huge mural on the corner of Main and Grubb streets,
with the New York Yankees cap emblazoned in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   And there's Jimmy Hunter Drive, where the future major leaguer
led the Perquimans Indians to the state championship in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, those landmarks weren't quite enough to erase the
sadness of losing a local legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are nice to remember him by, but the only trouble
is, I wish he was still here,'' said Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   Hertford Hardware owner Erie Haste said life in the cozy small
town won't be the same without the person that put it on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to leave the whole community in a sad state for a
long time,'' said Haste, who can remember Hunter coming to his
store as a 12-year-old. ``It's hard to measure the impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Haste said Hunter's notoriety gave everyone in Hertford a sense
of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that really stands out in my mind was when I was on
vacation in Hawaii and one of his games came on the radio,''
recalled Haste. ``He was pitching in the World Series, so we stayed
up odd hours to hear the game. Even over there, everyone knew who
he was. I felt so proud then of even knowing this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter was not just a source of pride because of his
exploits on the diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved baseball, it was his vocation,'' said the Rev. Keith
Vaughan, Hunter's pastor at Hertford Baptist Church. ``But his real
love was Perquimans County and eastern North Carolina. He'd much
prefer to be hunting, fishing, that kind of thing, and be with his
kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody loved their family more than this guy did. That, I
think, is a part of being in northeast. North Carolina. That is
something that unless you're from here, you don't understand that
the most important thing to people from this part of the state is
family and community. And that certainly is the case with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Haste said Hunter's family is made of the same tough cloth that
Jimmy himself was cut from. That strength has been called upon in
heavy doses over the last 10 months, through Hunter's initial
diagnosis with Lou Gehrig's disease and his recent three-week stay
in the hospital after falling and hitting his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy was such an elegant guy and such a fighter that we hoped
something would happen along the way that would improve (his
condition),'' said Haste. ``But I feel some relief for him and his
family and just hope that they can go forward knowing that for all
practical purposes he's in a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   Haste said watching Hunter battle ALS, a terminal disease that
slowly paralyzes the body, was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first time I recognized he was having problems
with his hands,'' said Haste. ``He was in one day and bought
something and reached in his pocket and handed me his wallet and
said, 'Erie, I can't. I can get my hand in my pocket, but I can't
get the money out.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then about a month later, he came in with one of his brothers
and was unable to even get the wallet out of his pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   At least, Haste added, Hunter won't have to suffer anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``As sad as it makes me, I feel some relief,'' said Haste,
``because the prognosis for a lingering illness with that disease
is very, very bleak.''
</P>
<P>
   Haste said Hertford will need time to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just so many things that Jimmy did that most people
don't know about,'' he said. ``Anytime there was a need for help,
whatever it was, it just seemed like he was always there willing to
do whatever he needed to do to deal with the situation. He's going
to be sorely missed by not only the people that saw him walk in
that door. People throughout the county will find that it's going
to leave a real void.''
</P>
<P>
   Stardom, Haste said, even with all its glitz and glamour, never
changed Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never changed one bit from the day he became an adult until
the last time I saw him.''
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a man who didn't forget his roots, Vaughan
said, Hunter is it. That, and not baseball, he added, will be his
lasting legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been so long since he actually played, that a lot of the
young people never saw him play,'' said Vaughan. ``He'll be
remembered as the guy that went to the little league park and took
up time with all the kids. He was just a member of this community
just like so many other folks in this community are.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life, he was my hero. Today, he is as much my hero as
he ever was. I just wish everybody's hero could turn out to be the
kind of guy mine was.''

 &HT;    MTV awards: Once shocking, now staid
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They used to be daring. The place where Madonna made
love ``Like A Virgin'' to a microphone in a sloppy wedding dress.
Where Prince bared his sequined derriere to a shocked crowd of
1980's dance fiends.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1999 Video Music Awards were more of a snooze than a
sensation, as even the most daring winners, such as metal thrashers
Korn (best rock video) and redneck rapper Eminem (best new artist),
walked away with trophies like a blase Liz and Dick at a 1960's
Oscar contest.
</P>
<P>
   The star-studded evening was more like a high school honors
banquet, with few thrills and fewer memorable moments, as Latin
hunk Ricky Martin and bland boy groups such as the Backstreet Boys
(winners of the Viewer's Choice award) dominated the once-edgy
landscape. Dressed in tight blue bell-bottoms with bare feet,
Martin once again wiggled his way through ``Livin' La Vida Loca,''
which won for best pop video. But host Chris Rock, who was the only
live wire in a basically flat-lined show, perhaps said it best:
``He'd better see another see another hit quick, or it will be
``Livin' La Vida
</P>
<P>
   Broke-a.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole show seemed like a blast from the past. Once
embittered lovebirds Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee snuggled. Hall
of famers turned presenters, such as Madonna and Prince, seemed
like once-animated trophies from a day gone by. Diana Ross showed
up. Even Atlanta's own TLC seemed stiff as they lip-synched their
way through ``No Scrubs.'' And in perhaps the most bizarre attempt
at attention grabbing, someone actually paired 75-year-old Buddy
Hackett with the cast of the ``Blair Witch Project''. Huh? The most
animated moment in the show was a 10 year reunion of Run DMC and
Aerosmith, for a resurrection of ``Walk This Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Come on, MTV. Modern music isn't this stiff. Let's figure out
how to make the now-famous awards show more interesting than
``Behind the Music.

FIVE YEARS LATER, OATES LOOKS LIKE A GOOD HIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Irony came calling this week.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyland announced his retirement as a major-league manager,
reportedly burned out and distraught over not being able to relate
to today's players.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates, meanwhile, received an earlier-than-expected nod
of approval from Rangers owner Tom Hicks. Oates will be back in
2000, after Hicks changed his mind and deemed it unnecessary to
judge his manager on postseason success or failure.
</P>
<P>
   Well, well...
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that long ago when Leyland was the biggest of the big
among major-league managers.
</P>
<P>
   It also wasn't that long ago when some of us _ OK, me for sure _
considered Oates a nervous little ball of managerial paranoia.
Based on his Baltimore resume, Oates was burnout waiting to happen.
And speaking of relating to today's player, Juan Gonzalez alone
would be Oates' ticket to the nuthouse _ so I thought five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But trying to be nice, my column accused new general manager
Doug Melvin of ``boring us all'' when he hired Oates in October of
1994. And there was also this question:
</P>
<P>
   When would the Rangers get serious and get aggressive and go out
into the managerial market and make a Tony La Russa, a Leyland, a
Tom Kelly, a Lou Piniella, a Davey Johnson _ or a personal favorite
in Don Baylor _ the kind of offer one of them couldn't refuse?
</P>
<P>
   I actually looked it up yesterday _ the first five on my
five-years-ago list had a combined record of 52 games under .500,
and Baylor is out of work at the moment, while Leyland wants out.
</P>
<P>
   All Oates has done since 1994 is bring previously unheard of
stability to the managerial job in Arlington. Hicks is not the
hands-on owner in the mode of Tom Schieffer or George W. Bush, but
he pays attention and then does what's right, be it baseball or
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there should be any less pressure on Oates or Melvin
when the postseason comes, but the larger picture shows an overall
franchise headed due north, capped by this exceptional season. The
next step for Hicks should be to have the contract extensions
signed and sealed before the end of the month, as a show of playoff
faith.
</P>
<P>
   In an eat-crow conversation with Melvin yesterday about certain
editorial comments of five years ago, it was mentioned that him
hiring a friend like Oates had paid off. Which is not always the
case in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have made that mistake because we had been
together in the Baltimore organization, and Johnny was my first
hire \Ras a new general manager\s,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we aren't friends, not in the sense of spending a lot of
time together socializing, going out to dinner, hanging around,
that sort of thing. Johnny is a very private person, and I respect
that. I think that's what our relationship is based on _ a respect
for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin obviously knew all about the Oates' knocks in Baltimore,
about how Orioles owner Peter Angelos had Oates hanging off a
mental ledge. In three years as the Orioles' manager, Oates never
had a losing record but he also never came close to meeting
Angelos' expectations. The more insecurity Oates displayed, the
more he was fried in the Baltimore media.
</P>
<P>
   From all that, this was Melvin's hire in Texas. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing was the old baseball theory about every manager is
better after having been fired once,'' Melvin said. ``I thought
Johnny would learn from previous mistakes, and he did. But I also
needed a good and thorough baseball man, and that's never been a
problem for Johnny.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows this game. I was going to be busy putting together a
scouting and personnel department. I couldn't be worried about us
having a team that knew fundamentals or played hard. I thought
Johnny could provide all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Oates, there has also never been stronger clubhouse unity
in Arlington, despite some very strong personalities. ``You only
have to look at Anaheim or the Dodgers to understand that's not
something to be taken for granted,'' Melvin said. ``One thing about
Johnny, he's not a personal glory seeker. He believes the glory
should go to the players. Whatever needs to be handled in the
clubhouse, he does it privately and firmly.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever or however, the Oates formula is working. And five
years later, so is Johnny, with a sixth season now coming. It
didn't have to be Leyland, LaRussa, Kelly, etc., to finally get it
going in Arlington. I stand corrected.

HOCKEY STILL IN RANGERS PLAYER'S HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The dream hasn't died, even after 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens, wearing a Hockey Hall of Fame T-shirt, still thinks
about it, even while sitting in front of his locker at The Ballpark
in Arlington and getting ready to play in a major-league baseball
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I watch a hockey game on television, at every Stars
game I go to, it crosses my mind,'' Stevens said. ``I think about
playing in the NHL. Don't get me wrong. I love baseball. But it's
not my passion like hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not just another flight of fancy. This is not Michael
Jordan riding the buses in the minor leagues and thinking one day
of playing for the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, a Stars season-ticket holder, doesn't just love hockey,
but there was a time when he was good at it. It was his favorite
and best sport growing up outside Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   If fate _ or President Reagan and a national strike _ had not
intervened, Stevens might easily be training with the Stars rather
than returning to his hometown with the Rangers tonight for a
four-game series against the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say,'' Stevens said. ``But that's what I wanted
to do. As much as hockey is in me, barring injury, I could have
done something. I could have done more with it than baseball. It's
just a gut feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Other baseball players have been known to excel at hockey. Larry
Walker, who grew up in British Columbia, was a goaltender for 13
years. Tom Glavine was drafted out of Billerica (Mass.) High School
in the fourth round by the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ferguson Jenkins used to play hockey in the off-season,'' said
Rangers general manager Doug Melvin, who is from Jenkins' hometown
of Chatham, Ontario. ``He used to play in an industrial league with
my brother. I think he broke his hand one year. Got in a fight. He
was a pretty good hockey player.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens hasn't done badly in baseball. Playing regularly as the
Rangers first baseman this season, Stevens is hitting .289 with 22
home runs and 76 runs batted in. But who knows? If he had been a
hockey player he might have a couple of Hart trophies (NHL most
valuable player) on his shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely good,'' said Tim Swail, a childhood friend
who played on the same hockey teams with Stevens. ``There was a
group of us together who grew up playing with each other year after
year. Lee was always one of the top guys. He always had the kind of
ability people wished they had.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, who played hockey until he was 13, said similarities
between the two sports allow an athlete to excel at both.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need the great wrists, great vision and the hand-eye
coordination,'' Melvin said. ``Plus you have to have a sort of
no-fear attitude. Somebody checking your head into the boards is
like facing a pitcher with a 95 mph fastball. You have to be
mentally tough to play both sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who grew up in a suburb of Kansas City, started playing
hockey when he was 6. By age 9, he and Swail were on a traveling
team, playing weekend tournaments across the Midwest. Swail was the
goalie. Stevens played defenseman and left wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one game we won, 12-0, and I scored 11 of the
goals,'' Stevens said. ``I was mad I didn't score the 12th.''
</P>
<P>
   Swail said: ``He had an incredible wrist shot. He was so tall
and strong. He had by far more strength than any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, Swail and two other close friends, Lance Shore and Pat
Crosby, shared a dream of playing hockey for the University of
Minnesota and for the United States in the Winter Olympcs. Stevens
was 13 when the United States upset the Soviet Union in Lake
Placid, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get goose bumps when I see the highlights on
television,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' hockey career came to end the next year. His father was
an air traffic controller and his union conducted a nationwide
strike in the summer of 1981. Reagan reacted by firing them all.
The Stevens family relocated to Lawrence, Kan., an hour west of
Kansas City. It was not a hockey hotbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough, but most kids get over that kind of stuff
quickly,'' Stevens said. ``I just started playing basketball in the
winter.''
</P>
<P>
   He was pretty good at other sports. He was all-state in
basketball and a first-round draft pick by the California Angels in
baseball. He signed with the Angels but has never lost the itch to
play hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one more game,'' Stevens said. ``Even at the lowest
minor-league level where they make $300 a month. I'd just love to
play one more game.''

NORTHWESTERN NEXT TO TEST REELING TCU DEFENSIVE BACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Reggie Hunt buried his face in his hands
like a kid at a scary movie. His hands provided little relief.
</P>
<P>
   Film of TCU's season-opening loss to Arizona played on before
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to see it. I knew what was coming,'' said Hunt,
an all-America candidate at safety. ``I looked bad, and I felt
worse. It was the absolute worst game I've ever played in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's secondary looked like a ``Blair Witch Project'' outtake,
youngsters wandering lost and confused while a seemingly
unstoppable force tormented them. Wildcats receiver Dennis
Northcutt played that role, jumpstarting his Heisman Trophy
campaign with a 257-yards-on-10-receptions performance. Oh yeah, he
also scored three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   A long season of sequels awaits unless Hunt and Co. start
playing like the strength the coaching staff expected coming into
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line? We have to make plays,'' Horned Frogs defensive
coordinator Gary Patterson said. ``We were waiting for somebody
else to make plays, and we need to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs commit eight, sometimes nine players to stopping the
run. The secondary is then responsible for anybody who wanders too
far beyond the line of scrimmage. Defensive backs are often left in
man-to-man coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are going to have any success against us, they are
going to have to throw the football, and that's what we tell our
kids. Either you are going to make a play or they are going to make
a play,'' cornerbacks coach Chris Thurmond said. ``Our whole deal
is you are not going to run against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona didn't, finishing with 14 yards on 37 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter. The Wildcats made the plays in the passing
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was embarrassing,'' Frogs safety LaVar Veale said. ``It was
like the second half we came out, and I don't know if it was being
overanxious or nervous or what, but we made a lot of mental
mistakes, and that cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   The gaffes were big, obvious and almost always ended in
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   There is the image of 6-foot-2, 286-pound Brandon Manumaleuna
``slipping'' through coverage and standing all by himself for one
of Arizona's five passing touchdowns. ``We blew coverages simply
because we weren't talking,'' cornerback Greg Walls said. ``The
confusion was among ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems didn't stop there. When the communication broke
down, everybody started trying to play everybody else's position,
plus their own. Hunt said he was the biggest offender, trying to
get in on every tackle instead of just making the ones in his area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is I got impatient. They were running away from me,
and I got impatient because I wanted to make a play,'' Hunt said.
``It was selfish of me. From now on it's going to be a whole new
ballgame, a whole new Reggie Hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said TCU's secondary is better than it showed but
acknowledged Northwestern is likely to test the theory Saturday.
The Wildcats' passing game certainly could use a jumpstart.
Quarterback Nick Kreinbrink, making his first start, completed nine
of 29 pass attempts in Northwestern's 28-3 season-opening loss to
Miami of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest failure was the passing game,'' Northwestern coach
Randy Walker admitted. ``On paper, that plays into TCU's hands.
They're great against the run, and we can't throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Said TCU coach Dennis Franchione: ``I would say it would still
be \RWalker's\S nature to try to run the ball, but I think they'll
take some shots throwing wise that they haven't or wouldn't have
taken otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreinbrink said he can't wait. He said he took one look at the
Arizona film, the reliance on man-to-man coverage, one-on-one
playmaking and blitzes, and he became excited. He stopped short of
saying the slash-and-burn way Arizona treated TCU's secondary made
him think it would be easy pickings.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to. Hunt figured that's what everybody would be
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so. I hope they look at that game and say the secondary
is a weakness because we'll all be all-Americans if that happens,''
Hunt said. ``We're a lot better than what we showed. If they throw
at us, they'll see.''

``The money ain't bad at all,'' he said. He wasn't kidding. But he

WILLIAMS SISTERS CLOSE TO OPEN SHOWDOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. _ There is no record of Papa Maleeva ever
predicting an all-Bulgarian, all-sister final between any two of
his talented daughters, Manuela, Katerina and Magdalena. Not even
in 1993, when all three were seeded at the Australian and French
Opens.
</P>
<P>
   Even though all three Maleeva sisters were ranked in the top 10
at one time, the previous best sister act in women's tennis wasn't
nearly as good as the current super siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams predicted an ``all-black'' U.S. Open final
between his two talented daughters, 19-year-old Venus and
17-year-old Serena, earning scorn from top-ranked Martina Hingis
and little agreement from anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, the sisters can make dad's prediction come true.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams plays Lindsay Davenport in the first semifinal
at Arthur Ashe Stadium, followed by Venus Williams against Hingis.
Both are confident that father knows best, and that there will be
an all-sister final in a Grand Slam tournament for the first time
since Wimbledon in 1894, when Maud Watson defeated Lilian, 6-8,
6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad has been right about a lot of things, you have to
admit,'' Serena said.
</P>
<P>
   The results show that he took the right steps, did the right
things, to raise a pair of tennis champions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite living in what he has called a ``ghetto'' in Compton,
Calif., Williams dreamed of his daughters dominating a country-club
sport. He put rackets in all five of his daughters' hands and began
coaching them before they barely were old enough to ride a bike.
</P>
<P>
   Venus and Serena were blessed with an abundance of athletic
ability, and showed an aptitude for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   By age 12, Venus was 63-0 in United States Tennis Association
sectional play in Southern California. Serena showed similar
promise. Richard predicted they would be ranked No. 1 and 2 in the
world someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought we would,'' Venus said. ``That's what we
were practicing for. We had an aim and a goal. It was a given what
we were going to do in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard didn't rush his girls into that future. Venus played a
handful of tournaments in her early teens, but it wasn't until she
was 17 that she became a fulltime player. Serena joined her last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a lack of professional coaching and professional
experience, it was clear they had the ability. Both had rippling
muscles, big serves, powerful ground strokes and tremendous court
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The raw talent didn't immediately translate into world-class
results. Venus finished her first year on tour ranked No. 22 in the
world, while Serena was No. 20 at the end of her freshman season.
</P>
<P>
   The more experience they gained, however, the better they
became.
</P>
<P>
   Venus won three tournaments last year and moved up to the No. 5
ranking. She has won five events this year, and is up to a
career-best No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Serena has won three events this year. She is No. 6 in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the success and experience is a confidence that
borders on cockiness.
</P>
<P>
   Venus was asked after winning her quarterfinal match against
Barbara Schett who would win if she and Hingis both are at the top
of their games today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me,'' she replied without hesitation. ``If I'm playing my
best, it's tough, guys. Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena, on the other hand, said she doesn't necessarily even
have to be at her best.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're playing Serena, honestly, even on a bad day I'm
tough to beat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters are similarly talented, similarly confident, and
similarly fond of each other.
</P>
<P>
   They travel together, practice together, watch each other's
matches.
</P>
<P>
   They even play doubles together although, with Venus recovering
from a bout of flu, dad suggested they save their energy for
singles this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``He recommended it to us, but in the end he said it was our
decision,'' Serena said.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was daughters know best. They beat Monica Seles and
Mary Joe Fernandez in straight sets yesterday to move into the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The sister act rolls on, in both doubles and singles. Like good
daughters, they are making dad look good.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be easy to make his prediction come true.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis is ranked No. 1 in the world and has won seven of her 10
matches with Venus, including a straight-set victory in the final
of a tournament in San Diego the last time they played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won in San Diego, which was on the same surface as it is
here,'' Hingis said. ``I'll try to do the same thing as I did
there, try not to miss much and make her play and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is ranked second, although she is 0-2 against Serena.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for two sisters to get even this far in a Grand Slam
tournament is unprecedented in the open (since 1968) era.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Increasing numbers of Roman Catholic
priests and nuns are being killed in East Timor, Indonesia's only
predominantly Christian province, according to reports Friday,
while evidence mounted that the military command in Jakarta, under
pressure from abroad, is slowly beginning to assert control in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican said Thursday that Roman Catholic institutions had
been singled out for attack by militias in East Timor and called
for a United Nations peacekeeping force to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing another genocide, a genocide that does not spare
the Catholic Church,'' said Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, the
Vatican's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   The church was responding specifically to reports of the
slayings of about 100 people, including four Catholic priests, in
an attack on a church in the southern town of Suai.
</P>
<P>
   Another victim was said to be the head of the East Timorese
office of the Catholic aid agency Caritas, the Rev. Francisco
Barreto, a prominent voice for moderation in the territory. The
agency's office in Australia said that several other Caritas
workers had also apparently been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center, the human rights and diplomacy organization
based in Atlanta, reported that a well-known nun had been killed in
Dili. And in another report, the Rev. Jose Carbonel of the Silesian
order said in Jakarta that six nuns of the Canossian order had been
killed in the city of Baucau, where the Roman Catholic bishop,
Basilio do Nascimento, was reported Wednesday to have been wounded
and forced to flee into the hills.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, armed militias burned the home of Bishop Carlos Belo,
who fled to Australia. There also are numerous reports of churches
being burned.
</P>
<P>
   East Timorese exiles also said that the militias had killed the
82-year-old father of Jose Alexandre Gusmao, the pro-independence
leader who was released three days ago after seven years of
detention.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday the United Nations began its planned evacuation of
the bulk of its staff in Dili, the capital of East Timor, leaving
behind about 100 officials to maintain a presence.
</P>
<P>
   In one possible sign that some order was being restored,
Indonesian troops were reported Thursday to be helping to resupply
the besieged U.N. office.
</P>
<P>
   With military-backed militias destroying the territory's
communications system and forcing the departure of most journalists
and other outsiders, reports of massacres and terror were difficult
to verify.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation of five representatives to the United Nations met
with President B.J. Habibie on Thursday and received a new promise
that Indonesia would act to curb the militias, which have been
killing, burning and looting for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
   In Auckland, New Zealand, Jose Ramos-Horta, a leader of the
Timorese independence movement, said Friday that he would tell
leaders at an Asia-Pacific economic forum that intervention was
necessary to stop the killing in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the international community does not stop it in the next
few hours, tens of thousands of people will be dying _ dying from
killing, dying from starvation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As international pressure on Indonesia intensified, Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas admitted that the military command in Jakarta
had lost control of the situation in East Timor, a tiny territory
of 800,000 people, which Indonesia invaded in 1975. The violence
there intensified after the announcement Saturday that the East
Timorese people had voted by nearly 80 percent, in an independence
referendum Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military as an institution, the police as an institution,
are not in support of the people burning and killing and looting,''
Alatas said. ``These are criminal activities, and we are going to
put a stop to it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new promise. Elements of the military and police
have openly aided and participated in the violence and in an
extraordinary campaign of forced migration that has driven out some
200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Alatas denied that people were being forced to leave, and called
the reports of relief organizations and witnesses ``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people want to go to safer places, and we are helping
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some were being corralled in camps in the neighboring Indonesian
territory of West Timor, where armed militias continued to keep
them under control and prevent foreigners from talking to them.
Others were being put aboard ferries and sent to distant islands.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the U.N. delegation met with Habibie Thursday and
said he agreed to let them visit Dili on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expressed our concerns very strongly about the continuing
humanitarian problems and the bloodshed in East Timor,'' said Sir
Jeremy Greenstock, the British representative to the United
Nations, who is a member of the delegation.
</P>
<P>
   An official traveling with the U.N. mission described the
meeting with the president as a ``reality check.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear that Indonesia's perception of what is going on
in East Timor is quite different to the rest of the world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's position is that reports from East Timor have been
exaggerated, that there is no organized campaign of killings and
arson, and that no one is being forced out.
</P>
<P>
   A smuggled videotape from Dili, filmed three days ago, showed a
city in ruins, its buildings smashed and scarred, its streets
littered with abandoned vehicles but empty of people, and its sky
filled with dense smoke from burning buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But there were reports from Dili that the violence there had
ebbed.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting this view, the chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen.
Sudrajat, told reporters Thursday: ``There has been an improvement.
Generally the burning has stopped, although clouds of smoke were
still seen rising from certain pockets. Hopefully within two or
three days all public facilities will resume as normal, and by next
week the situation would be fully restored.''

U.S. GENERAL WAS OVERRULED IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 1st graf to change `block' to `evict')  (dal) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The British general in charge of NATO forces in
Kosovo refused to obey an order from NATO's supreme commander, an
American, to evict Russian troops after their surprise take-over of
the main airfield there in June, the Pentagon's senior military
commander told Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the two commanders was resolved quickly by
British and U.S. military leaders in favor of the Briton, Gen.
Michael Jackson, over the American, Gen. Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had rejected the order from his superior by saying:
``No, I'm not going to do that. It's not worth starting World War
III.''
</P>
<P>
   That account was given Thursday by Gen. Henry Shelton, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a hearing of the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Although the incident was reported by Newsweek magazine last
month, Shelton is the first senior official to confirm that the
dispute was resolved at the highest levels between the British and
U.S. military commanders, and that it has raised serious doubts
about NATO's chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, said he would hold hearings to determine whether
Jackson's refusal amounted to insubordination, or if it was
permissible under NATO rules, which he would then want to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you run a military operation if the subordinates can
decide they don't want to follow the supreme commander?'' Warner
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said the affair was ``troubling,'' especially during a
military operation, where discipline can be ``a matter of life and
death.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Embassy in Washington said Thursday night that the
government would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   In June, as NATO first entered Kosovo after its bombing campaign
to suppress Serbian forces, Russian troops made a surprise grab for
the airfield outside Pristina, the provincial capital. In this
early tense period, when Russian intentions were unclear, Clark
ordered Jackson to send tanks and armored personnel carriers to
take back the airstrip from the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to move something in on the airfield to ensure
that no one used the airfield to reinforce or to start pouring
in,'' said Shelton. ``And so the first thing the next morning,
General Clark told General Jackson that he would like to move some
armored vehicles up on to the thing _ up on to the airfield.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson refused. After Clark stood his ground, Jackson said
that control of the airfield was not worth starting a world war
with the Russians, and that he would discuss the order with his own
British commander, Gen. Charles Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   This practice, known in NATO parlance as using a red card,
allows a subordinate to ask his own national commander for
permission to disobey a foreign officer who is superior to him in
the NATO chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Shelton was awakened by Guthrie, his British
counterpart, and the two men agreed that taking back the airport
was not worth a split in NATO. Within days Jackson's argument that
the Russians would not be able to upset the NATO operation through
control of the airport proved correct, and the Russians were
eventually brought into the multinational peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   A major factor in resolving the conflict between these two
strong-willed commanders was the varying degree of support each man
won from his military.
</P>
<P>
   The British successfully argued for Jackson's position, while
Shelton essentially allowed Clark's orders to be overruled, said a
Pentagon official.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 10-week air campaign Clark had several
disagreements with the Pentagon (and in fact he is leaving his NATO
command two months early). For example, he had to push to overcome
the Army's resistance to his request for Apache helicopters. While
the helicopters were eventually sent to Albania, they were never
used in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no question of a difference of view and that Clark
wanted to confront the Russians and the British didn't,'' said an
administration official involved in the dispute. ``Jackson thought
we Americans were blowing out of proportion the importance of the
airfield, and he wasn't willing to risk soldiers' lives for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of the dispute, during NATO's first war, remains
unclear, Pentagon officials agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, this had been theory only,'' said a Pentagon official.
``If in fact, this is permissible in the gentlemen's club of NATO,
then it's something we have to look at and we may have to rethink
these niceties.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the official said, the United States would be
reluctant to give up exactly the discretion exercised by Jackson:
the ability to question orders from foreign commanders that would
put U.S. soldiers in harm's way.

CLINTON SAYS JAKARTA MUST ACT OR ADMIT TROOPS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton demanded on Thursday that
Indonesia permit an international peacekeeping force to try to
restore order in East Timor if the Indonesian military is unable to
end ``this madness'' _ the wave of violence that has taken hundreds
of lives across the tiny province since it voted for independence
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Indonesia does not end the violence, it must invite, it
must invite the international community to assist in restoring
security,'' the president said at the White House as he prepared to
leave for the Asia-Pacific economic summit meeting in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   But the president did not threaten an immediate cutoff of
economic assistance to Indonesia, as some lawmakers and human
rights groups had wanted. Nor did he cut off commercial arms sales
to Indonesia, which are expected to total about $16 million over
the next ear.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said that he had ordered the Pentagon to suspend its
few formal contacts with the Indonesia military, and that he would
consider economic sanctions if the killings in East Timor did not
stop. ``My own willingness to support future assistance will depend
very strongly on the way Indonesia handles this situation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States was prepared to assist Australia in
its efforts to form an international peacekeeping force for East
Timor, an idea Indonesia has rejected. Clinton made clear that no
decision had been made on the extent of American involvement in the
mission. The Pentagon has said there are no plans to deploy
American ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has faced a difficult calculation in deciding
how to react to the bloodletting that began after the independence
referendum in East Timor. Hundreds of people are reported to have
been killed by anti-independence militias backed by elements of the
military.
</P>
<P>
   More Roman Catholic priests and nuns became targets in East
Timor on Thursday in what the Vatican interpreted as a campaign
against the church. At the same time, the United Nations sharply
reduced the size of its staff in Dili, the capital of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton acknowledged on Thursday that the United States was
unclear on how decisions were being made in Jakarta, the Indonesian
capital, about how to deal with the killings in East Timor. He said
it was possible that ``nobody's got the authority'' among
Indonesia's military or civilian leaders to quell the violence.
</P>
<P>
   While strongly protesting the violence, the United States wants
to preserve a relationship with the civilian government of
President B.J. Habibie, which has been responsible for democratic
reforms in Indonesia, an archipelago nation of more than 200
million people. East Timor, a former Portuguese colony of about
800,000 people, was invaded and annexed by Indonesia in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton touched on the larger policy dilemma when, at the
beginning of his remarks on East Timor, he saluted Indonesia for
its ``important democratic transformation,'' adding, ``It has the
capacity to lift an entire region if it succeeds and to swamp its
neighbors in a sea of disorder if it fails.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Indonesia's economy, which was ravaged by the
Asian economic crisis, has begun to rebound in recent months,
largely as a result of billions of dollars in American-backed
emergency aid through the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a pity if the Indonesian recovery were crashed by
this,'' he said of the crisis in East Timor. ``But one way or the
other, it will be crashed by this if they don't fix it, because
there will be overwhelming public sentiment to stop the
international economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Precisely because Indonesia's future is important, I am so
deeply concerned by the failure of its military to bring a stop to
gross abuses now going on in East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF had already suspended all emergency aid to Indonesia,
even before the crisis in East Timor, because of concerns over
possible misuse of funds previously sent to Indonesia. And because
of the current violence, an observation team from the IMF that was
to have gone to Indonesia this month has postponed its trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that, in effect, any future assistance from
international financial institutions is effectively cut off as of
now,'' Thomas Pickering, the undersecretary of state for political
affairs, said on Thursday in congressional testimony. ``There will
not be any more forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of military cooperation between the United States
and Indonesia is little more than symbolic, since military ties
between the two countries have been sharply limited by Congress in
recent years because of human rights abuses attributed to the
Indonesian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ended military exercises with Indonesia last
year. As a result of Thursday's action, the United States will
freeze a $470,000-a-year military training program between the two
countries and a handful of officer exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
   Informal contacts between the two nations will continue. Clinton
administration officials said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, intended to remain in contact with
his Indonesian counterpart, Gen. Wiranto, who is considered the key
figure in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance before Congress on his nomination for a second
two-year term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Shelton said he
spoke with Wiranto by phone on Monday and ``laid out for him in no
uncertain terms what I thought we needed to see from Indonesia, and
specifically from him.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he said the United States was alarmed by the violence
that has overwhelmed East Timor, Shelton stressed that American
national security interests were not on the line in the tiny
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly if you look at East Timor by itself, I cannot see
any national interest there that would be overwhelming _ would call
for us to deploy or place U.S. forces on the ground in that area,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The general instead described the crisis in East Timor as a
``moral issue'' that ``very clearly challenges our role as a leader
with other nations in that region of the world.''

SLAYING ON DEATH ROW DISTURBS A LISTLESS WAY OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Since it opened in 1983, New Jersey's death row
has existed in a kind of no man's land between life and death, a
place of languid rhythms where condemned killers await execution by
lethal injection, even though no one has been put to death since
New Jersey reinstituted capital punishment in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners at the unit at New Jersey State Prison, about a third
of them sedated by medication prescribed for various psychiatric
disorders, tend to move slowly or not at all. While their cases
crawl through the appeals process, they spend at least 21 hours a
day alone in 7-by-12 cells equipped with a sink, a toilet, a
television and a few belongings, with only a narrow window onto the
unit's common area of institutional blue walls and fluorescent
lights.
</P>
<P>
   But when Ambrose Harris stomped Robert ``Mudman'' Simon to death
on Tuesday, just a few months after a judge's ruling seemed to move
another case toward an execution date, the slaying served as a
brutal reminder of what death row is ultimately about.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the land of the hopeless,'' said Cathy Waldor, a
lawyer who represents one death row inmate. ``These people are
convicted of murder, surrounded by no one but other convicted
murderers. When you have people waiting to die, you're going to
have a morose environment. What else is there but death?''
</P>
<P>
   Security has always been tight on death row, officially the
Capital Sentencing Unit, on the theory that condemned prisoners are
more dangerous and desperate than other inmates. They are forced to
strip each time they walk out of their cells, and to walk out
backward, so officers can search them for weapons. When an inmate
is moved out of the unit, for a medical appointment or a court
appearance, a warning siren sounds throughout the entire prison,
and all other traffic comes to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   But residents of the unit said that the possibility of the
state's actually executing someone had seemed so remote that
condemned prisoners used to joke with corrections officers about a
stretcher kept in the common area of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd ask them if that's where they were going to strap us down
and give us the injection,'' said Kevin Jackson, who was sentenced
to death for fatally stabbing his neighbor, Meredith Levithan, in
1985. ``It seemed like a joke. The place just didn't have the aura
of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is one of about 40 inmates to have death sentences
overturned because of various procedural errors during their
trials, and he left the unit in 1990 when his sentence was commuted
to 30 years to life.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Death row has moments when violence seems to be hovering just
out of sight, and it is impossible to forget how macabre a place it
is.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in May, for instance, a television news report on
a shooting rampage at a Georgia high school elicited a brief,
ghoulish moment of shared recognition between Simon and Harris, who
were lived in adjacent cells.
</P>
<P>
   While a reporter, photographer and corrections officials stood
outside the cells during a tour, Simon shouted through the thick
cement wall separating the two inmates: ``Did you see they shot up
another school? They only got six. Too bad. They should have
brought more ammunition.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who was sentenced to death for the 1995 murder of a
young artist, and Simon, who murdered a Franklin Township police
officer, then shared a moment of appreciative laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's assault apparently followed less convivial exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Corrections officials investigating Simon's death said the two
men had apparently exchanged insults in recent weeks because Harris
had accused Simon of waking him at night by banging on the wall
between their cells. When Simon and Harris entered a caged
recreation area so their cells could be treated by an exterminator,
they muttered at each other. Simon said, ``Let's get it on,' and he
lunged at Harris, said witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The men exchanged blows until Simon's head hit a table which is
bolted to the floor, and he fell to the ground. Harris then climbed
upon the table and jumped on Simon's head repeatedly, while three
other inmates watched and corrections officers scrambled to
assemble a response team to enter the cage.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not violence that characterizes everyday life on death
row; instead, it is a listlessness that seems to give the place a
sense of suspended animation. So many prisoners are lethargic from
medication that the unit sometimes seems more like a psychiatric
hospital than a prison.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, however, a series of court rulings have made
death seem more imminent. In July, a judge in Bergen County set an
execution date for an inmate, John Martini, and for 17 days,
officials busily prepared to put a prisoner to death for the first
time since 1963. Martini, condemned to die for the 1989 kidnapping
and murder of Irving Flax, a Bergen County businessman, had been
trying for five years to hasten his execution.
</P>
<P>
   He has since changed his mind and is pursuing a federal appeals
process that will take at least three years. But inmates on death
row have become edgier, according to Anthony DiFrisco, who was
sentenced to death for killing Edward Potcher, the owner of a
pizzeria in Maplewood.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, since the Martini decision, it all seems more
real,'' DiFrisco said through his lawyer, Larry Lustberg.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners and lawyers say death row is like prison, only more
so.
</P>
<P>
   Meals are delivered to prisoners in their cells through a hatch,
and every other day, inmates take turns bathing in a locked shower
the size of a phone booth.
</P>
<P>
   Many inmates pass the day sprawled on their beds reviewing legal
documents, writing letters or watching televisions bolted to the
walls.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Kise, 36, said he is still haunted by the year he spent
on death row after he was convicted on charges that he beat, robbed
and drowned Thomas Smothergill, 22, on New Year's Day 1986. Kise
said he kept himself occupied by focusing on his legal appeals and
using his telephone calls (inmates are allowed two collect calls
daily, of no more than 15 minutes each) to stay involved with his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can tell when the pressure is getting to a guy,'' Kise
said. ``When the doctor comes around, they complain about
nightmares or insomnia, and they're given psychiatric drugs. One
day they're normal; the next time you see them, they're just
shuffling around with their heads down. Zombies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kise's legal work paid off. He was granted a retrial, he hired a
new lawyer, Raymond Castiliero, and he was acquitted of murder
charges. After serving nearly 10 years for conspiracy charges
related to the killing, he was released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Like most prisoners, Kise said the highlight of death row
inmates' lives is the brief recreation periods that break up the
monotony and shape much of the unit's social order.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey regulations allow inmates two hours of indoor
recreation a day and an hour outside, in the courtyard, every other
day. It is during those hours that inmates exercise, play cards,
chat, exchange legal advice and, on occasion, fight.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After Simon's death, some prisoners' advocates criticized
corrections officials for allowing such dangerous prisoners to
congregate. But New Jersey has relatively tight restrictions on the
movements of its death row inmates' compared with other states.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, for example, death row inmates have been allowed
access to a recording studio and face-to-face visits with family
members, and one inmate apparently conceived a child during one
visit. New Jersey allows death row inmates to meet visitors only
through thick glass panes and does not allow them to participate in
any of the work crews available to the prison's general population.
</P>
<P>
   Before Simon's death Tuesday, New Jersey corrections officers
and inmates alike said that death row is in some ways less
physically demanding than other New Jersey prison units. Because
there are fewer inmates, there is less chance of an officer's being
overwhelmed by prisoners, said John Cunningham, vice president of
the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association Local 105.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Koskovich, who was tried this year for the 1997 murder of
Giorgio Gallara, a pizza shop owner, and Jeremy Giordano, a
delivery driver, told his lawyer he was worried about being
subjected to the rapes and assaults that are common in more crowded
sections of the prison. When Koskovich, 19, was convicted and sent
to death row, he said he was relieved by the relative solitude of
the unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The isolation can be difficult,'' said his lawyer, Lucas
Phillips. ``But it spares someone from having to adjust to the
harsh society of general population.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Corrections Commissioner Jack Terhune has ordered a
review of the regulations for death row inmates that may further
restrict inmates' recreation privileges. Some other states allow
inmates to take recreation one at a time, restricting them to lives
of near-total isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners' rights advocates say that such a policy would be
dangerous to the mental health of inmates because many condemned
inmates already have psychiatric problems that could be worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to imagine being locked in your bathroom every day for 23
hours,'' said Ed Martone, director of the New Jersey Association on
Corrections. ``The isolation would break the healthiest of people.
So you can only imagine what it does to someone already mentally
unstable, especially when they know that their only way out is
death.''

 &HT;    Black churches elect reformer
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The National Baptist Convention USA ended one of
the most shameful chapters in its history Thursday night when it
narrowly elected a ``squeaky clean'' reformer to become its new
president.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Shaw, pastor of the White Rock Baptist Church in
Philadelphia for the past 43 years, was narrowly elected president
of the convention by 163 votes during a high-stakes election that
attracted national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw received 3,614 votes to beat the front-runner, the Rev. W.
Franklyn Richardson, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., who garnered 3,451
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Rows of convention delegates stood up, clenched their fists and
shouted, ``Yes!'' when Shaw's victory was announced. An organist
broke into a rollicking gospel tune as Shaw, a soft-spoken pastor
with a scholarly air, took the podium at the Ice Palace Arena in
downtown Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God,'' Shaw said. ``Be prayerful that God will give us
the unity and healing that we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Most convention delegates think Shaw offers an answer to that
prayer. He pledges to strip the presidency of its unbridled power
and establish an outside auditor to monitor the convention's
finances.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Donaldson Jones, a delegate from Burlington, N.C.,
acknowledged Shaw may not be as charismatic as past presidents, but
he's safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an intellectual,'' Jones said. ``He's not a moaning,
sing-song preacher. We realize the media will have a magnifying
glass on the next candidate. We don't mind you putting the
spotlight on him because he's squeaky clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's predecessor could not survive the same scrutiny. Shaw's
election comes six months after the convention's previous
president, the Rev. Henry Lyons, resigned and was imprisoned on
state and federal charges that included bank fraud and stealing $4
million from charities and companies trying to do business with his
church group.
</P>
<P>
   The Lyons scandal, with its lurid tales of mistresses and lavish
lifestyle, pushed the nation's largest black church body into the
national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the group's mission when it gathered in Tampa this week
for its 118th annual session was restoring its tattered image.
Shaw, who lost to Lyons in the group's last presidential election,
pledge to restore integrity by installing strict financial
accountability within the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw plans an immediate freeze on the convention's nonessential
spending and an audit of the group's financial records. He also
wants to hold a national assembly in November at which convention
members would evaluate and plan how the organization should change
its way of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Riggins Earl, a convention delegate and a professor at
Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta, said Shaw's
cautious approach to reform may rankle convention members who want
swifter change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaw said he wants the process to be studied, and, in a
democratic society, that's ideal,'' Earl said. ``But the convention
hasn't been run like that. It's almost going to take a dictatorial
style of leader to come in with progressive thought and say, 'This
is what we're going to change, case closed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, a native of Texas, has been preaching since he was 17
years old. As president of the Pennsylvania Baptist State
Convention, he implemented a centralized accounting system that dug
the group out of deficit within a year taking office, Shaw
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw also is active in the civic and political arenas. He is on
the board of directors for two Pennsylvania hospitals as well as
serving on the board of the United Way.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has a huge task at hand. He seemed to be aware of that.
As he walked off the stage, the slim-framed preacher seemed
overwhelmed as delegates surrounded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm humbled,'' was all he said before he was whisked away.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Rockets picked up the pace of their courtship of Shandon
Anderson on Thursday, meeting with the free agent throughout the
day in an increased effort to entice him to sign with the team.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anderson, considered the top unsigned free agent, and his agent,
Dan Fegan, met with Rockets coaches, officials and team owner
Leslie Alexander, coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who spent his first three NBA seasons with the Utah
Jazz, and the Rockets did not reach an agreement, but Tomjanovich
said the meetings went well and that Anderson's willingness to make
a second trip to Houston could be a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had a good visit,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He went out
and talked with the coaches and met with Les. But he's a free
agent. It's his choice. That's the way it is with this deal. But
we're still in the running.''
</P>
<P>
   Fegan said last week Anderson had narrowed his choice to the
Rockets or the Pacers. But the Jazz can offer a larger contract
than either team and is expected to make a last run at retaining
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, already over the salary cap, could offer only the
$2 million-per-year salary-cap exception.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 25, averaged 8.5 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last
season as a Jazz reserve. The Rockets envision the 6-6 Anderson as
a starter at shooting guard and as a backup to Scottie Pippen at
small forward. He also would fit into their plans to move to a more
up-tempo style of play. He is considered an excellent defender at
either position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the kid,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I think he can really
help out. Normally, we don't talk about these sorts of things, but
it's pretty obvious _ the guy's been here a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is not the only free agent to express an interest in
the Rockets. Although talks are not nearly as advanced, Rockets
officials have spoken with veteran Suns center Joe Kleine about
potentially filling the spot as a reserve center vacated by the
trade of Antoine Carr.
</P>
<P>
   Kleine said he has spoken to Rockets vice president Carroll
Dawson and Dawson has spoken several times with his agent, Lee
Fentress, although no offer has been made.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets could offer Kleine a veteran's salary-cap exception
of $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of admiration for Charles (Barkley), Hakeem
(Olajuwon) and Scottie (Pippen),'' Kleine said. ``They are three
great players. And I'm a big fan of Rudy (Tomjanovich). He's a
great coach. Any player would have to be crazy to not want to be a
part of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just talked to me. But I told them I was interested. I
was glad to hear from them. I hope to hear from them again. I hope
things work out, but in this business you never know until it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich declined comment, citing team policy about
discussing potential player moves.
</P>
<P>
   Kleine, 39, a veteran of 14 NBA seasons, played in 31 games last
season, averaging 2.2 points and 2.2 rebounds. The Suns had shown
interest in bringing Kleine back for another season but might not
be able to re-sign him after Wednesday's addition of free agent
Corie Blount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure at first if they would be interested,'' Kleine
said. ``Charles is so old and decrepit, I thought they would try to
get younger. Actually, Charles is a friend of mine. It would be a
lot of fun to play with him again. He played really well last year
and has some years left, if that's what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can still step in and help for 15 or 20 minutes a
game. And in a pinch, I can handle more minutes if needed.''
