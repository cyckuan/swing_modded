<P>
   ARCADIA _ To the relief of those who worry the new owner will
completely ruin Santa Anita Park, Frank Stronach revealed Saturday
that there is a limit to his imagination.
</P>
<P>
   It ends at the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mountains will stay,'' Stronach said with aplomb when
someone asked which _ if any _ of Santa Anita's distinctive
features he !ital!wouldn't!off! consider changing. ``There's no
question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   So that's good news: The mighty San Gabriels will always be part
of a day at Santa Anita. As for everything else that makes racing
here special, the message is wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   Stronach has proposed sweeping changes for the 64-year-old
track, which his Magna International Developments purchased two
weeks ago for $126 million. And that lent a bittersweet atmosphere
to the opening day of the four-month season.
</P>
<P>
   For those in the crowd of 42,000 who follow the racing industry
news, it was impossible not to linger over favorite places in the
320-acre park, wondering if they'll still be here by the day after
Christmas in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For me, there's the Seabiscuit statue, honoring Santa Anita's
first superstar; the odds board up near the roof on the back of the
grandstand, beckoning the real sportsmen among the fancy people in
the walking ring; the footpaths to and from the paddock, upon which
even a 1/100th owner of a $10,000 claimer feels like a billionaire
walking between staring fans; the giant ``Shoe Wants You'' poster
that adorns a grandstand stairwell, recalling a classic old ad
campaign; Clockers' Corner, one of sports' great gathering spots;
the elegant main room of the clubhouse; the clubhouse mezzanine
where the jockeys' agents and other sharpies gather; and the
underground Paddock Room that's still thick with down-and-dirty
atmosphere if no longer with cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Some, or most, or all of those might be gone if Stronach goes
ahead with his head-spinning array of plans for the tradition-bound
track and its precious real estate: Construction of Citywalk-style
stores, restaurants and amusements in an area partially covered by
the paddock gardens, building luxury suites and condominiums and a
hotel, the last project to require lopping off part of the
clubhouse; installing a second turf course after removing the
hillside portion of the existing turf course, and underground
parking.
</P>
<P>
   And Stronach, born in Austria 66 years ago, said nothing
Saturday in his first press conference as Santa Anita's chairman to
indicate there's anything iffy about any of this. He repeated his
proposals of the past two weeks, firmed up some of them, and added
at least one, suggesting vaguely that he'll purchase more U.S.
tracks and make Santa Anita part of a ``network.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes to implement ``in a few weeks'' a plan to
basically eliminate the current $5 general-admission price by
charging $6 and giving each patron a $4 food voucher and a $2
betting credit.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has budgeted about $50 million for ``immediate''
architectural changes, which he'd like to begin as soon as the end
of the meet in April, pending City of Arcadia approval.
</P>
<P>
   He said major projects like the complete reconstruction of the
barns could be accomplished in five years.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds like progress. It all sounds like good thinking in
a sport that's suffered from too little imagination.
</P>
<P>
   And Stronach does promise that for every garden that is taken
away, a prettier garden will be added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's going to be a little pain, isn't there?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if opening day felt more like a rebirth, the start
of something big; or a funeral, the death of something grand. Maybe
what it felt like was a bris.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Saturday afternoon, Stronach was seen strolling
with a lieutenant through the crowded mezzanine. Every few yards,
he'd pause and gesture toward some nook or cranny of the massive
structure, pointing out an area of potential improvement.
</P>
<P>
   It was a slow walk. Lots of stops. But no, he never once pointed
at the mountains. &QL;

NHL TO NBA: DON'T GO THERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It's an unsettling feeling for more than a
few NHL players, to be on the outside looking in as the holidays of
NBA players are turned upside down and shaken, just to see if their
resolve will fall like snow in one of those kitschy plastic domes.
</P>
<P>
   When NBA commissioner David Stern recently declared a drop-dead
date in the league's protracted labor dispute, it triggered
flashbacks to the 1994 yuletide season for the likes of Phoenix
forward Bob Corkum and Kings defenseman Rob Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnuts-on-an-open fire kind of memories, they were not. A
Christmas tree catching on fire in mid-carol is closer to it. The
family fir didn't go up in flames but a year of their precious
careers nearly did.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects of any games being played in 1995 seemed bleak to
Blake at this time four years ago. Corkum, then the
player-representative for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, was
conflicted over taking care of future generations of players and
tending to the day-to-day needs of his growing family. But each got
by and now their bottom lines are better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Neither carries any visible scars from the lockout, just the
usual ones from sticks to the face. Indeed, all the players on the
Forum ice Saturday who had sweated out the 104-day work stoppage
would be able to block out the whole sorry saga if not for that
eerie feeling of deja vu they keep getting whenever they pick up a
newspaper or turn on the television.
</P>
<P>
   A deadline declared in the dead of December.
</P>
<P>
   Verbal volleys exchanged between the two negotiating principals
with no face-to-face follow-ups.
</P>
<P>
   A union-organized charity game.
</P>
<P>
   Growing fan disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   A Christmas that was a paler shade of green, owing to the
tightening of purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gus Van Sant's remake of ``Psycho'', the NBA version of ``A
Lockout'' has been faithful to the original NHL script.
</P>
<P>
   ``The similarities that do exist are overwhelming,'' Corkum said
before the Coyotes' game against the Kings. ``It is like living it
all over again and just for that reason, it is (unsettling).''
</P>
<P>
   What a role player such as Corkum or even a standout like Blake
who is as decorated on defense as Dikembe Mutombo, can't relate to
is the high-end salaries in the NBA. Kevin Garnett's salary would
pay for a line of Wayne Gretzkys and the profits that are at the
center of the tug-of-war between the NBA and its players' union
would have a giddy NHL incredulously double-checking its figures.
</P>
<P>
   It's all relative, though, which is why Corkum doesn't wince
when Dallas Mavericks millionaire Kurt Thomas' quote of a couple of
days ago _ the one that made us choke on our gruel _ is relayed to
him. In case you missed it, Thomas said the lockout hasn't affected
him, really, because he lives as though he makes ONLY $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum presumes that Thomas didn't mean to put down the large
percent of the population for whom a six-figure salary would be a
princely wage. Just as he can appreciate (if not relate to) the
comfort zone Kenny Anderson was coming from when he went on about
having to maybe sacrifice one or two of his eight luxury
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get used to a certain lifestyle and your monthly bills
reflect that,'' said Corkum, who in 1994 listened to many a player
relate acute financial concerns during NHLPA conference calls.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was the players for the most part kept the
hardship stories to themselves, having been reminded ad nauseum by
the executive of the players' union, Bob Goodenow, that whining
would win them no public sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently NBA union rep Billy Hunter forgot to mention that to
his membership. ``You've got to be so careful what you say,'' said
Kings defenseman Garry Galley, who was a player rep in Philadelphia
in 1994-95. ``Because what you say can determine how people
perceive your cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake put it more bluntly: ``You don't want to look like greedy
people.''
</P>
<P>
   That's but one piece of advice Blake has passed on to
ex-Clippers guard Brent Barry. As an impending free agent, Barry's
immediate future hangs tenuously in the balance of the ongoing
dispute. He has kept in regular contact with Blake, seeking his
advice not only as a friend but per Blake's role as the NHLPA vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is inside two weeks of the deadline imposed by Stern.
The NHL reached a settlement after its so-called drop-dead date. Of
course, in the end it wasn't really the number that mattered as
much as it was the sense of urgency that came attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember as the date got closer guys saying, `We've got
to be careful. This game is loved by a lot of people and we're
jeopardizing that,''' Galley said.
</P>
<P>
   The final deal, which was ratified by 85 percent of the
membership in time to salvage a 48-game season, didn't set well
with Corkum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still giving them more than we should,'' he said at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday Corkum admitted that time has sort of smoothed over
his ruffled feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years later, looking at the way salaries have escalated,
you have to say it was a good deal,'' Corkum said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anyone who has been through a war knows there are no
winners, just survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' Corkum said, and by the tone of his voice it
was clear he meant it. &QL;

COYOTES DEFEAT KINGS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ With their Christmas break behind them, the
Kings were looking Saturday night to build on the momentum they'd
generated with consecutive road victories earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   But with the usual combination of an inept power play and an
untimely defensive breakdown, consider the momentum gone.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Adams' goal with 2:33 to play was the difference in a 2-1
victory by the Phoenix Coyotes before a crowd of 13,898 at the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (10-21-3), who are 0-3 against the Coyotes (20-6-4)
this season, now face the daunting task of visiting Phoenix on
Monday night. The Coyotes are 10-1-1 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Adams scored the game-winner when he took a Shane Doan pass at
the blue line, skated around Kings defenseman Doug Bodger, drove to
the net and swatted the puck into the net while falling to the ice.
</P>
<P>
   But the game had been lost _ or at least it had not been won _
earlier in the third period, when the Kings could make nothing out
of three power-play chances. As has so often been the case, the
Kings not only didn't get any goals with the man advantage, they
didn't even manage to produce any serious scoring opportunities. In
fact, they often struggled to get the puck out of their own end of
the ice, at times because of the checking of the persistent
Coyotes, but at other times because of their own sloppy passing.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, why should the power play have been any different on
a night when zeroes dominated the Kings' thoughts?
</P>
<P>
   The Kings entered the game with zero victories and zero points
against their own division, the only team in the NHL still able to
claim such a dubious distinction.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Coyotes in town, it brought to mind another zero
that left the Kings with an empty feeling.
</P>
<P>
   In their first meeting with Phoenix this season, the Kings were
3-0 losers. In the next meeting, Phoenix won 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 11:30 Saturday, the Kings weren't worried about
getting a goal. They were worried about getting a (begin
ital)shot(end ital) on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, rookie Pavel Rosa managed to put a long shot at Coyotes
goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, who easily made the save. Then, at
12:03, Rosa stole the puck along the right boards in the Coyotes'
zone and passed it to Vladimir Tsyplakov, who fired the puck over
Khabibulin's glove and into the net, ending Phoenix's shutout hex
of the Kings at 139 minutes, 22 seconds dating to last season.
</P>
<P>
   But it was one of the few offensive highlights in the first two
periods for the Kings, who managed just 10 shots on goal in the
opening 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Kings were fortunate to hang onto the lead
against the Coyotes, who were playing without star left wing Keith
Tkachuk, who is sidelined with a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   With seven minutes left in the first period, Rob Blake cleared a
loose puck out of the crease just before the Coyotes' Jeremy
Roenick could swat it past goalie Jamie Storr.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix trailed after one period despite outshooting the Kings,
14-4, but 4:08 into the second period, the Coyotes got on the board
when Blake was trapped deep in the offensive zone. On the resulting
2-on-1, Roenick appeared to lose control of the puck in front of
the Kings' net, but when defenseman Mattias Norstrom couldn't clear
it, Roenick was able to poke it in. It was the first goal allowed
by the Kings in 114:14, a span that began in their 4-1 victory in
Chicago a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The next goal they allowed was the one by Adams, which forced
the Kings to pull Storr in the last minute for an extra skater. But
the Kings could not get the equalizer and fell to 0-7 against
Pacific Division teams.

THE MAN BEHIND THE BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - He has been in charge of one of the Valley's
oldest sports franchises for nearly 10 years, leading it through
crises that threatened its survival and nurturing it into one of
the leaders in its industry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few Valley sports fans could pick John Junker, the executive
director of the Fiesta Bowl, out of a lineup. ``That's very healthy
and good,'' Junker said of his anonymity in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Most bowl officials fit the stereotype of loud, boisterous
people who press flesh and hand out business cards. The short,
43-year-old Junker looks more like a Wal-Mart manager than one of
the most powerful men in college football.
</P>
<P>
   His influence is wielded behind the scenes. He does his
homework, builds consensus, and if he goes out on a limb, it's
always the strongest one he can find.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sort of blends into the background,'' said Don Meyers, a
Phoenix lawyer and one of the bowl's founders. ``Some of the other
bowl directors who were loud, who were always out in front, who
were all talk and no action, have disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Junker's understated approach is never more evident than each
spring when the bowl sponsors a golf outing that attracts coaches,
athletic directors and conference commissioners to the Valley. Amid
the movers and shakers of the sport, Junker looks like a guy who
cleans golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very low-profile,'' said Roy Kramer, the commissioner of
the Southeastern Conference and one of the designers of the current
Bowl Championship Series. ``One of John's great traits is that he's
been able to . . . bring that innovative approach to other bowls
without them feeling he's trampling on them or being overbearing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to question Junker's effectiveness. In his
nearly 10 years as executive director, he has led the bowl through
hard times, sponsorship difficulties and social upheaval over a
Martin Luther King holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a survival mode all the time,'' Junker said.
</P>
<P>
   There were times during those years that there were serious
doubts that the bowl would prosper. Yet today, it's one of the top
four bowls in the country and will host a game Jan. 4 between No.
1-ranked Tennessee and No. 2 Florida State that should determine
the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   It's no small accomplishment, but Junker wants little credit for
it. He points to the bowl's 2,500 volunteers. He credits his staff
of 21 full-time employees. He praises the community for making it
possible. But he won't ever say that John Junker is a major reason
the bowl is where it is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volunteer aspect of the Fiesta Bowl is really the untold
story of what this bowl is about,'' Junker said.
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Junker is the untold story, and he would prefer to
keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   He is a graduate of Arizona State University and was assistant
sports information director there for two years. Those were glory
days at ASU, when Frank Kush coached football.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Junker's love of college football blossomed, and
Kush made things more interesting than most coaches. Today, Junker
and Kush are good friends, and Junker can still do a decent
imitation of the old coach.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, Kush asked Junker to vote for him in the old
coaches' poll run by United Press International.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, `Well, Coach, we're playing real well, we have to be
in the top five or six,' '' Junker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Frank would say, `What the hell are you talking about!
Don't even put us on that damn thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Junker, who has a journalism degree, was hired at the Fiesta
Bowl in 1980 by Bruce Skinner, then the executive director.
</P>
<P>
   His main duties, as one of four employees, were to handle the
bowl's public relations, but the job developed into much more than
that.
</P>
<P>
   He helped negotiate a sponsorship with Sunkist. It was the first
agreement of its kind in the bowl business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Junker left the bowl to become the executive director
of the John Hancock Bowl in El Paso, but a year later Skinner left
to start his own business.
</P>
<P>
   Junker was wooed back to the Fiesta Bowl, but not before a
meeting of the bowl's board of directors, who were divided between
Junker and Kirk Hendrix, an assistant at the Fiesta Bowl at that
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people claim, erroneously, that the decision was made
in front of the fireplace at my house,'' lawyer Meyers said. ``But
we recognized we had the votes to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The task facing Junker was daunting. The bowl was in financial
trouble after it sponsored a festival that flopped badly. Junker
had to make cuts, including eliminating some jobs. The employees
who remained were overworked and underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure wasn't pleasant, and in retrospect I have some
regrets,'' Junker said. ``I wish I had dealt with people better in
some ways.`
</P>
<P>
   The challenges continued. In 1990, the Fiesta Bowl suffered
through difficult times while Arizona grappled with the King
holiday issue. Many colleges that normally would have accepted bids
to the bowl refused because the state lacked a King holiday, and
the bowl settled for inviting two lesser teams, Louisville and
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing years, there seemed to be a crisis every year.
Three times, the bowl had to search for new sponsors. For two
years, it lacked a title sponsor and survived thanks to local
sponsors that filled the gap.
</P>
<P>
   And when some of the top conferences in the country talked about
forming a coalition, guaranteeing their champions berths in the top
bowl games, Fiesta officials had to move quickly to work their way
into the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   As the coalition developed into the bowl alliance and now the
Bowl Championship Series, the Fiesta Bowl kept pace, and through a
bid process, earned the right to host this year's title game, the
first under the BCS agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm not shocked the Fiesta Bowl went from the smallest
to the largest,'' said Alex Crutchfield, the bowl's president in
1987. ``We've had an awful lot of good people who have worked in
this bowl. Somehow, we were always on the cutting edge, and John
has continued that.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Crutchfield and Junker worked together often,
traveling to sponsorship meetings or to watch games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was quiet and I was overbearing and a loudmouth,''
Crutchfield said. ``Once in a while he would have a beer, and I,
once in a while, would not have a beer. But he was fun and I
watched him grow from an honest, caring young kid into a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Running a bowl is crisis management, and through the years,
Junker learned a key lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You begin to realize you are not in control of things,''
Junker says. ``It helped me get my life priorities in place. Faith
and family and those things are more important.''
</P>
<P>
   While Junker still works long hours, he carves out more time at
home with his wife, Susan, and two children, Lucy, 6, and Michael
Dale, 3, than he used to.
</P>
<P>
   Junker readily admits he's still not particularly easy to work
for.
</P>
<P>
   He is notoriously late for appointments, and if you wanted to
torture him, you would force him to show up at the airport an hour
early for a flight. That's what happened a few weeks ago, when he
was traveling with the bowl's president, Herman Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Herman, if you told my staff we were here an hour
before the plane was leaving, they wouldn't believe it,' '' Frazier
said. ``If there is a knock on him, it's that whenever it's time to
go somewhere, you have to pull him out of the office and get
going.''
</P>
<P>
   When Junker has time for lunch, the meal isn't a long, drawn-out
affair. If Junker picks the place, you're liable to end up at a
small sub shop next to a coin laundry just off Van Buren, a short
drive from the Fiesta Bowl office in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Junker likes the place because it's quick, it's good and few
people recognize him. In that way, it's just about like any other
place in the Valley. &QL;

FIESTA BOWL: BIG GAME, LITTLE CASH

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - College football fans weren't the only ones
trying to figure out how the Bowl Championship Series was going to
work in its inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   Folks over at the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, which is hosting the
BCS' first championship game this season, have done a lot of
brainstorming, number crunching and brow wiping trying to figure
out how the whole thing would work out financially.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS formula that rates the top teams in the country is
complicated enough. Try figuring out how a bowl will survive
financially despite losing revenue from television and title
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   That is the daunting task that's faced John Junker, the Fiesta
Bowl's executive director, and his staff for the past two years as
the BCS has taken form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a stressful couple years getting ready for it,''
Junker said. ``But I think we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS has dramatically changed the way its participating bowls
_ the Fiesta, Sugar, Orange and Rose _ do business. Under the new
agreement, which runs for four years, all money from title
sponsorship goes to ABC, which is televising the four games each
year.
</P>
<P>
   The payouts to the participating teams, about $13 million each,
are made by ABC from one big pool. (Most of the money is
distributed among the teams' conferences.)
</P>
<P>
   That's a dramatic departure from the past, when bowls were free
to negotiate their own deals with title sponsors and networks and
were responsible for determining their own payouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta Bowl thrived under that free market. It was the first
bowl to acquire a title sponsor (Sunkist), and it helped
revolutionize the sports marketing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, those revenue streams are as dry as the Salt River bed, but
the four bowls still have to find ways to raise the $4 million
payment they each make to the BCS pool each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little tougher than it used to be,'' Junker said, ``and
sometimes it's a lot tougher than it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   When the BCS was being formed, Fiesta Bowl officials knew they
wanted to be a part of it. Anything less would have been a step
down for the bowl, which will have its fourth national championship
game Jan. 4 when No. 1 Tennessee plays No. 2 Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   The question was: What would it cost the bowl?
</P>
<P>
   There was some discussion, Junker said, of becoming a bare-bones
operation and cutting back dramatically on the number of events
that were staged and the level of service provided to participating
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really thought about it,'' he said. ``It was apparent that
wasn't in congress with our identity. We didn't want to be in the
business of telling teams, `Hey, we'll see you on game day.' That's
not the kind of community we're from. Everybody here has people
from all over the country coming to visit. Hospitality is a way of
life around here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an incredible experience to one day wake up and
find yourself the owner of the Cardinals, the Suns, the
Diamondbacks or the Coyotes. That's not going to happen. But there
are a tremendous number of people who really do own the Fiesta
Bowl. It's as much community-owned as anything I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowl officials, who work with about 2,500 volunteers, looked at
their alternatives. The largest locally generated revenue source
available to bowls comes from ticket sales. So the Fiesta Bowl
hiked prices from an average of $80 last year to about $135 for
this upcoming game.
</P>
<P>
   They looked at sponsorship money. Tostitos nows pays ABC
directly for the title sponsorship rights to the Fiesta Bowl. But
Tostitos is still contributing to the bowl directly by sponsoring
other activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to play to our strengths even more so now,'' said
Herman Frazier, who holds the bowl's presidency, a voluntary
position. ``We have to be innovative to come up with some things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta is still sponsoring 51 annual events ranging from a
band pageant to a duck race to a parade. Some events, like the duck
race, are designed as fund-raisers. With other events, organizers
say silent prayers that they will finish in the black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parades, band pageants, those kinds of things can be sources
of revenue,'' Junker said. ``But there is also a pretty fair amount
of risk with them. If it rains on your parade or block party, or
you have a sponsorship (deal) that has a last-minute
complication.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS benefits the Fiesta Bowl in one big way: Every four
years, it guarantees the bowl of a game featuring the top two teams
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't possible in the old days when bowls made deals
behind the scenes to try to secure the best matchups. And it wasn't
possible under the agreements that preceded the BCS because the
Rose Bowl wasn't a part of it, meaning the Pac-10 and Big 10
champions were not in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   There are some business drawbacks to the BCS, however. ABC has
exclusive agreements with companies in some sponsorship categories,
meaning the bowls are not free to negotiate with competitors in
those categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a complaint,'' Junker said. ``It's just one of the
things we've had to go through that have made it more of a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In its long-term projections, the bowl expects to lose money in
three of the four years of the agreement, making money this year.
Those projections are conservative, said Junker.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the margin for error is small, and with a big game like
this one, it's tempting to spend more than budgeted, Junker said.
``And you don't have to be a large percentage over in any one area.
When you do it cumulatively, you can have a big financial
hangover.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying financially viable is one of the bowl's biggest
challenges in the years to come. That's why Junker and bowl's board
of directors have met with Cardinals officials and heard their
pitch for a proposed domed facility east of Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting the Fiesta Bowl would be a major acquisition for
those pushing the new stadium, and the opportunity to make more
money through things such as seats and skyboxes would be attractive
to bowl officials.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Junker is non-committal about his views about the
proposed facility, saying only that it's something the bowl has to
monitor closely, particularly in these financial times.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few sure things in our business,'' he said. &QL;

ADAMS SPARKS COYOTES  
 GOAL IN 3RD PERIOD DECISIVE VS. KINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The last time the Coyotes were seen in Tinseltown,
they were flying high and completing an unbeaten November with a
10-0-1 record, which most teams only dream about.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, they are finally done flying after putting on 11,624
air miles while playing 11 of their past 13 on the road and coming
away with a 7-4-2 record after Saturday night's 2-1 victory over
the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a dominating 23-10 shot advantage entering the
third period and seeing it reduced to 25-23 in the next 15 minutes,
it could be suggested that the Coyotes are tired, especially
considering that those numbers came against a Kings team that has
been outscored, 38-25, in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the late-game heroics of veteran left wing Greg Adams,
who scored at 17:27 of the final period, they can open a five-game
homestand Monday against the Kings in a good frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Adams picked a pass off the boards from Shane Doan and deked
goalie Jamie Storr out of position for the game winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes penalty kill returned to its early-season
brilliance, snuffing five L.A. power plays, three in the third
period, while giving up only two shots. And they had goaltender
Nikolai Khabibulin, who, after sailing calm waters in the first two
periods, was brilliant in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin had little work to do for much of the first period as
Phoenix dominated in every area except one _ goals, which is the
reason they play the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' forecheck held the Kings without a shot for the
first 11:26 of the game and only four for the first period, while
taking 14 against Kings goalie and former Roadrunner Storr. By 7:55
of the second period, the shot total was a lopsided 21-6.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Phoenix, the Kings' Vladimir Tsyplakov scored
on their second shot at 12:03 of the first. Khabibulin, who blanked
the Kings, 3-0 and 4-0, at the Great Western Forum in November, saw
a shutout streak over the Kings that dated back to last season and
had lasted for a hockey eternity _ 136 minutes, 54 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I have so much success against the Kings,''
said Khabibulin, who stopped 26 shots. ``It just happens that way
against some teams.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that Khabibulin is rested, having made his 20th
start in the 30th game. Last year he had 27 starts in the first 30
games. It's a product of design, as Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld
wants him rested and ready later in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, so good,'' Khabibulin said. ``The team isn't losing.
Maybe the rest will help later in the season. I don't know, because
I've never been in this position before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I accepting it? I'm accepting it and I have no choice. As
long as we win, it's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Tysplakov barely beat Oleg Tverdovsky to a weak pass from Pavel
Rosa. Finding himself wide open in the slot, he lifted a shot over
Phoenix defenseman Keith Carney's block attempt and beat
Khabibulin's gloveside at the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Phoenix, assistant captain Jeremy Roenick
countered Tysplakov's goal at 4:08 of the second period on a
brilliant but far from picturesque play.
</P>
<P>
   He scored while sliding into the crease to knock home his own
rebound after taking a pass from Dallas Drake. He used Drake's
position on the wing perfectly to keep the lone defender honest
before firing on Storr from point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   It extended Roenick's scoring streak to six games, during which
he has had five goals and three assists. In his last 20 games, he's
had 10 goals and 28 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, if I get a chance, I feel I can bury it,'' Roenick
said of his hot play. ``It's just a matter of getting the chances
that makes me nervous. You gotta take it to the hole because it
creates a lot of havoc and turmoil. Anything can happen then.'' &QL;

AUDETTE HEARTENS KINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At 5 feet 8, 184 pounds,  &UR; Donald Audette could get
lost in the tall forest that is the Los Angeles Kings, but he
hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Since he joined the Kings two games ago from Buffalo for a
second-round draft choice after holding out most of the season,
L.A. is 2-0, and Coach  &UR; Larry Robinson credits him for adding heart
to his team.
</P>
<P>
   On his very first shift against Chicago, Audette crashed the net
and knocked home a rebound at 1:36 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys on the bench saw him and said, `Hell, if he's going
to the net, we can, too,' '' Robinson said at Saturday morning's
skate. ``That's what has made Phoenix so successful this year,
going to the net for rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of games, we've shown patience in our own zone
defensively. We're not causing needless turnovers, like Phoenix has
been doing. Most goalies in this league are going to stop the first
shot. That's why it's important to crash the net for rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes forward  &UR; Rick Tocchet thanks Robinson for the
compliment, but he wishes it was better deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry is giving us too much credit,'' Tocchet said. ``We have
and haven't done it well. It's one thing the captains, especially
 &UR; Keith
 &UR; Tkachuk, are constantly all over guys (about). We could be a better
team going to the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't have just two or three guys doing it. We have to
sacrifice for each other, especially on the road. It's takes
courage to go in there, because you've got to take a shot to the
head.'' &QL; 
Yahoo, Juha &QL; 
Entering his 30th game Saturday against the Kings, forward
 &UR; Juha &UR; Ylonen had already topped his entire rookie output in 55
games last year by one with 13 points, and quadrupled his goal
output with four, including one in each of the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   He credits his improvement to ice time and playing with forwards
Tocchet and  &UR; Greg Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still playing my game (defense),'' Ylonen said. ``But if
you get more ice time, you get more chances. My confidence is also
much better. I still think defense first, but playing with more
offensive guys like Rick and Greg helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Finn  &UR; Teppo Numminen takes the analysis a step farther.
</P>
<P>
   ``More ice time helps, but when (the puck) starts going in, you
play more relaxed. You don't think about scoring and do what you
know how to do.'' &QL; 
Ice chips &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Numminen, too, has been on a tear, scoring five goals and
totaling 15 points in his last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea why,'' he explained. ``It's just later in the
season, I guess, and I've had a lot of power-play time. I've always
been a slow starter.'' &QL;

YEAR OF HIGH DRAMA, LOW COMEDY

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - You were like the child at Christmas. And like the
parent who lost the spirit in traffic jams and Furby searches.
</P>
<P>
   You were awed by the comets of history. And disgusted by stars
drifting further and further from our universe.
</P>
<P>
   You were treated to feats without peer, legitimate moments that
will stand like skyscrapers in the city of memories. And you spent
too much time in the back alleys, drawn in by the trash bins and
recycling containers of sport.
</P>
<P>
   To be a fan in 1998 was an exercise in cynicism and wonderment,
a relentless game of emotional Ping-Pong, a year that stretched
both ends to the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   A year, as any referee will attest, that was both heads and
tails.
</P>
<P>
   A year you followed in amazement. Or threw up your arms and
said, ``Luckett!``
</P>
<P>
   THE KINGS: Michael Jordan, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   THE JOKERS: The NBA.
</P>
<P>
   You want history? You got history.
</P>
<P>
   The world stopped for baseball, to watch two men conquer the
summer, the ghosts and the lingering bitterness infecting their
sport. McGwire and Sosa. Sosa and McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Our All-American hero _ Divorced, but loves his child; uses
andro but will stop if it's deemed illegal; cries at movies but can
hit baseballs to Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Our lovable immigrant _ Smiles for everyone; defers to McGwire;
doesn't mind telling you that beisbol been berry, berry good to
him.
</P>
<P>
   One hits 70, the other 66. One saves baseball, the other wins an
MVP award. Two giants on the inside and out, two athletes who
remember how to say thank you and actually mean it.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't enough, you watched 37-year-old John Elway win a
Super Bowl, flashing his Secretariat smile, holding the trophy in
triumph, admitting with candor that, yeah, he needed this to cement
his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   And the indomitable Michael Jordan, stealing the ball, working
the clock, faking a defender out of his Nikes, winning his sixth
championship with a jump shot that registered as perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Four men, four moments that will actually mean something 50
years from now. You're lucky if you catch one of these every
decade.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand . . .
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber, twice arrested for marijuana; Alonzo Mourning
goaded into a fight, handing a playoff series to the Knicks, crying
racism among NBA owners; J.R. Rider, complaining that they ``still
hang brothers from trees'' in the remote suburbs of Portland; Kenny
Anderson on the road to bankruptcy; Anthony Mason, showing up at a
disastrous charity game dressed in a full-length mink with his
number sewn on the back. A league that has lost perspective, a
lockout proving that grown men can be idiots.
</P>
<P>

</P>

<P>
   SUBJECTS OF VALLEY HYSTERIA: Jake Plummer. The Cardinals. Randy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   OF DESERT ANGST: Keith Tkachuk. Andre Wadsworth. Jerry
Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   AND POSSIBLY THE DUMBEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD: See below.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants more money. And if you're looking for the hotbed
of economic dissension, the greedy tapeworm growing inside
professional sports, hey, welcome to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Tkachuk had a contract, but demanded a new one. Andre
Wadsworth wouldn't report to camp without his own mint. And, boy,
does Jay Bell have a contract. Bank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks opened their roof on March 31, and it was
always about money. The price of beer, the overpaid veterans, that
damn tax. Coolergate, a hike in ticket prices on the weekend of fan
appreciation, a flap over renewal policy. A press conference to
explain the massive costs. And a few others to announce $119
million in free agent payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals shook the money tree for Eric Swann, succumbed to
Wadsworth, and in the apex of a playoff run, did the most
irrationally brilliant, un-Bidwillian thing ever in locking up Jake
Plummer. But the young quarterback must promise to never change his
personality or his wardrobe, never demand his own suite in the new
stadium, never order a fur coat bearing the No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils gave a raise to Bruce Snyder, who claimed,
without laughing, that he did his best coaching job ever. The
highlight of the Suns' season was when Colangelo killed
pay-per-view. And the Coyotes gave in to Tkachuk who, of course, is
once again scoring goals and hearing cheers. But to his credit,
Tkachuk has spearheaded one of the most dramatic one-year face
lifts ever displayed by an organization. Or, since Bill Parcells
took over the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Strange fact about the Valley: In terms of passion, the negative
far outweighs the positive. So while there were plenty of good
things, fortunately, there was plenty to complain about.
</P>
<P>
   Especially one of Randy Johnson's agents, who after negotiating
a $53 million contract, explained how overwhelming it was to have a
client take such a enormous stand on principles, to place family
over money. Doh!
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   THE BEST TEAM: The Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORST TEAM: The U.S. Olympic hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLY THE FUNNIEST THING I'VE HEARD: See below.
</P>
<P>
   There were memorable endings. To Cal Ripken's streak. To Eric
Swann's season. To Harry Caray's life.
</P>
<P>
   To David Wells' perfect game. To Kevin Johnson's career with the
Suns. To Phil Jackson's run with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   And possibly Jordan's groundbreaking, breathtaking career.
</P>
<P>
   To a season in which Arizona's basketball team may have smiled
once, but not after taking the silencer from Utah and Rick Majerus.
To a Coyotes' season that ended in ugly self-analysis, the catalyst
for where they are today.
</P>
<P>
   An end to the Same Old Cardinals. To a World Cup in which the
last-place, no-winning, coach-hating U.S. squad treated us to 32nd
place. To the nightmare in Nagano when some ill-tempered hockey
players tossed dignity and a few chairs out the dormitory window.
</P>
<P>
   There were profound beginnings. Like Tubby Smith and Kentucky.
The emergence of Mark O'Meara. The new Jeremy Roenick. And the
you-ain't-going-to-fool-me era of Rob Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kerry Wood (Kid Whiff), Jason Kidd (All-Star) and Randy
Moss (the real MVP). And, of course, Travis Lee and Pat Tillman.
One blessed, one obsessed. Two guys who come to work on bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   There were things that wouldn't go away. Dennis Rodman. The
suddenly annoying Karl Malone. A sit-down chat with Tonya and
Nancy. Phil Luckett and other whistles of incompetence, referees
who need glasses ``and'' hearing aids. And most of all, spiraling
salaries, a year in which baseball joined basketball in awarding
one man over $100 million. The latest being Kevin Brown, who
finally relented after snagging 12 free flights and a luxury suite.
</P>
<P>
   And to symbolize it all, in light of baseball's impending crisis
came the trade of the century, the dismantling of a World Series
champion, and a Marlins' team that held on to Mike Piazza for seven
days. When asked about his experience in Miami, Piazza shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed my time there,'' Piazza said. ``Tuesday was
very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   DEFINITELY ``IN'': Jake Plummer. Travis Lee. Teppo Numminen.
Antonio McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   DEFINITELY ``OUT'': Devon White. Eric Swann. Dennis Scott. Randy
Johnson's hair style, and believe me, I know this well.
</P>
<P>
   GIVE THAT MAN A MUZZLE: Rich Dozer.
</P>
<P>
   Some things don't fit into categories.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Miller's mind-numbing personality _ she almost cheered
her team to the WNBA title. Buck Showalter's intentional walk with
the bases loaded. Bob Ferguson's spectacular vision and belly full
of charm. The lightning rod known as Pat Murphy and an ASU baseball
team that nearly climbed a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive fire of Danny Ainge, who will nonetheless take a
mulligan on his guarantee of a three-game comeback against the
Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Larry Centers. The entertainment value of Rex
Chapman. The audio from Jeremy Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   The wit of Brian Anderson, who wondered how he could injure his
elbow during a cab ride, finally realizing that it had something to
do with ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the movie he saw later the same
night. ``So realistic it was scary,'' Anderson said. ``I figured
that some of the shrapnel must've hit me in the elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things, of course, were simply too strange.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, a broken scoreboard and a home run that sailed
through the open shutters at BOB. The porn star who showed up in
Flagstaff, along with her director who happens to be a Cardinal
groupie. The power outage at Sun Devil Stadium that only confirmed
the television trucks should've been in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the new blond-and-spiked hairstyle of Steve
Nash, who began to resemble a local Mercury star, so much that
Ainge saw him in the weight room over the summer and panned:
``Hello, Michelle.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's wishing that next year is half as fun. That Marv Albert
keeps his teeth clean. That Phil Mickelson wins a major. That Bobbi
Olson wins her fight with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   That 1999 won't constantly be framed party music from the artist
formerly known as Prince. And may the drama continue, with a few
less bad actors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   THE PSEUDO-LEGEND: El Duque.
</P>
<P>
   THE REAL HERO: Ryan Hines, a 12-year-old boy from Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was a tough year for heroes. A Canadian snow boarder was
temporary stripped of his medal when his drug test was mistaken for
Bob Marley's. Upon instructions from the Lord, Reggie White
un-retired and spewed a blizzard of stereotypes in a speech for
civility. A speech intended for idiots that hate, that sounded like
it came from one.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson lost his temper in front of a review board in New
Jersey, allegedly attacked a couple of motorists, and registered in
Phoenix as a sex offender.

<P>
   Kevin Greene bull-rushed a coach. Evander Holyfield fathered
three children, one actually delivered by his wife. Ryan Leaf
turned out to be the first successful cloning experiment in the
NFL, except the DNA belonged to Scott Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliation at Notre Dame. Point shaving scandals everywhere. An
Olympic gymnast who sued her parents and fled from her father, who
expressed remorse by saying she should really come home and resume
her training.
</P>
<P>
   A minor-league hockey player in Phoenix was arrested and banned
for life after bludgeoning an opponent with his stick. The color of
ignorance was pink, as in bellies. And you'd better check your
mail, because Latrell Sprewell might be suing you.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing comes close to Orlando Hernandez, the pitcher we
glorified for his daring escape from Cuba. A pitcher who never
refuted the myth, that he shared a raft, fended off sharks, put his
life on the line in a perilous race for freedom. And now we hear he
crossed over on a 20-foot boat.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but he did endure three days on a tiny island. No Gilligan,
and definitely no hero.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there were moments of inspiration. The Cubs winning one for
Harry. The tragic story of Sheldon Kennedy and his monstrous coach.
The Red Wings handing the Stanley Cup to a paralyzed Vladimir
Konstantinov. The tale of Casey Martin, who shined at the U.S.
Open, teaching golfers that there is more to life than manicured
fairways and the 19th hole. And the wonderful, horrible story of
Ryan Hines.
</P>
<P>
   He is 12 years old with a swollen, dying leg. He has Casey
Martin's disease in its worst version, but last summer, he played
in a basketball league. Despite the pain, both emotional and
physical, he fights back with optimism. He smiles and laughs, so
much that it breaks your heart.
</P>
<P>
   And two days before Christmas, this note arrived from his
mother:
</P>
<P>
   ````Wanted to keep you up to date with Ryan and his health. It
took a'' ``bad swing yesterday. A vein in his leg ruptured and now
his leg is'' ``infected. He is on serious doses of antibiotics and
bed rest, then'' ``surgery next week. His basketball days are over.
So it is pretty sad'' ``here today. My neighbor said you wrote
something on him last week. I'' ``missed it, but thanks for
thinking of Ryan as a trooper. He is one''.``''
</P>
<P>
   `` Tracy''''
</P>
<P>
   God bless you, Ryan. From all of us. &QL;

KINGS LOSE TO COYOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Victory was there to be taken.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings' power-free power play was up to its old tricks
again Saturday, struggling to get the puck out of its own zone most
of the night _ never mind producing genuine scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the mistake, the late defensive breakdown that
resulted in Greg Adams' goal with 2:33 to play, which was the
difference in a 2-1 victory by the Phoenix Coyotes before a crowd
of 13,898 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (10-21-3), who are 0-3 against the Coyotes (19-6-5)
this season, now face the daunting task of visiting Phoenix on
Monday night. The Coyotes (20-6-4) are 10-1-1 at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can keep saying it and keep saying it,'' Kings winger Glen
Murray said. ``But special teams win games. We should have won this
game on the power play, and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In their first two power plays, the Kings failed to generate a
single shot. In three more power plays in the third period, they
again went without a shot until finally managing to get two weak
ones off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they pressured a lot,'' Kings coach Larry Robinson
said. ``We didn't make a lot of good decisions with the puck on the
power play. Getting one there certainly would have made a huge
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute after the third power play of the third
period failed, Adams scored the game-winner when he took a pass
from Shane Doan at the blue line, skated around Kings defenseman
Doug Bodger, drove to the net and swatted the puck into the net
while falling to the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made one more move than I thought he was able to,'' Kings
goalie Jamie Storr said. ``He made a great play. Guys like that,
that's why they make the big bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes coach Jim Schoenfeld said: ``It was a great individual
effort by Adams. He took charge of the situation and won the game
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a night when zeroes dominated the Kings' thoughts. The
Kings have zero victories and zero points against their own
division, the only team in the NHL still able to claim such a
dubious distinction.
</P>
<P>
   And the Coyotes' presence evoked additional hollow images. In
their first meeting with Phoenix this season, the Kings were 3-0
losers. In the next meeting, Phoenix won 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first 11:30 Saturday, the Kings weren't worried
about getting a goal. They were worried about getting a (begin
ital)shot(end ital) on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, rookie Pavel Rosa _ who had six of the Kings' 27 shots
_ managed to put a long shot at Coyotes goalie Nikolai Khabibulin,
who easily made the save. Then at 12:03, Rosa stole the puck along
the right boards in the Coyotes' zone and passed it to Vladimir
Tsyplakov, who fired the puck over Khabibulin's glove and into the
net, ending Phoenix's shutout hex of the Kings at 139:22 dating
back to last season.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be the only offensive highlight for the Kings, who
managed just 10 shots on goal in the opening 40 minutes against the
Coyotes, who are playing without star left wing Keith Tkachuk,
sidelined with a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix trailed after one period despite outshooting the Kings
14-4, but 4:08 into the second period, the Coyotes got on the board
when Roenick scored. It was the first goal allowed by the Kings in
114:14, a span that began in their 4-1 victory in Chicago a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The next goal they allowed was the one by Adams, which forced
the Kings to pull Storr in the last minute for an extra skater. But
the Kings could not get the equalizer and fell to 0-7 against
Pacific Division teams.

MISSOURI FRUS TRATES W. VIR GINIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Ever since Larry Smith was hired at Missouri in
1994, the Tigers' football fortunes have been taking a steady climb
up.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri and Smith can now add a bowl victory to the dramatic
turnaround this program has taken during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers held off a furious and inspired comeback by West
Virginia to beat the Mountaineers, 34-31, in the 10th Insight.com
Bowl game Saturday night at a half-empty Arizona Stadium, where the
announced crowd was 36,147.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one to ever sit and rest on my laurels,'' said Smith,
who successfully returned to the city where he turned the
University of Arizona into winners. ```But it's obvious that a
program must think it's a winner before it can win consistently.
Still, you have to turn the corner every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's players believe they have finally reached a point
where the Tigers' program won't necessarily be on auto-pilot, but
the foundation for consistent winning has definitely been laid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most definitely this program has to be taken seriously now,''
said senior Devin West, Missouri's first All-American at any
position since 1986 and first All-America running back since Bob
Steuber in 1942. ``I'm not sure about the younger players, but I
know the juniors here now are mentally ready to take the next
step.''
</P>
<P>
   That step, according to Smith, is a Big 12 Conference
championship. Missouri last won a conference title when the 1969
team finished in a tie for the then-Big 8 championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We up our goals every year,'' Smith said. ``We wanted to
improve our record and win a bowl game this year, no matter what
the bowl game. We did both of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's victory capped the Tigers first eight-victory season
since the 1981 team also finished 8-4. West Virginia has now lost
an NCAA-record eight consecutive bowl games _ all under its most
successful coach, Don Nehlen _ breaking a tie it had held with
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia's last bowl victory came in the now-defunct
Bluebonnet Bowl in 1984 when the Mountaineers beat up on Texas
Christian, 31-14. Missouri hadn't won a bowl game since beating
Southern Mississippi, 19-17, in the 1981 Tangerine (now the Citrus)
Bowl. But the Tigers were appearing in just their third bowl game
since that victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of frustration because we really wanted it for
the seniors and for Coach Nehlen,'' said West Virginia receiver
David Saunders. ``We didn't talk about the streak too much, but we
knew it was there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mountaineers, who took the opening kickoff and drove down
the field with relative ease, started the game looking as though
their infamous streak would finally die.
</P>
<P>
   They successfully blended six running plays with five passes
during the 5 minute, 43 second drive, but Jay Taylor's 40-yard
field goal attempt was low and easily blocked by Jeff Marriott's
outstretched hands. Junior cornerback Carlos Posey scooped up the
bouncing ball and returned it 70 yards for the game's first score.
Posey was never touched during the return.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri eventually built a 24-3 halftime lead and appeared
headed toward an easy victory. But the Mountaineers emerged from
the halftime locker room ready to scale the 21-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia quarterback Marc Bulger, the game's offensive most
valuable player, moved the Mountaineers from their 27 to Missouri's
5 before a fourth down pass to Khori Ivy was broken up by Harold
Piersey, killing the drive but not West Virginia's determination.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers watched the Mountaineers comeback, which saw
Missouri's lead cut to 31-24 with 10:27 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's offense then put a wide smile on Smith's face when
the Tigers took nearly seven minutes off the clock on a
time-consuming drive that culminated with an 18-yard field goal.
The Tigers ran 13 plays during the drive, all of them runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that kind of football,'' Smith said. ``That would have
made Woody Hayes proud, there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mountaineers managed to drive down the field and score a
touchdown. West Virginia, however, could not get a hold of the
ensuing onside kickoff and Missouri ran out the clock to end the
game. &QL;

MISSOURI BACKUP GETS CHANCE, CAPTURES MVP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - Two days earlier, sophomore  &UR; Julian Jones was
preparing for his usual role as Missouri's best special-teams
player.
</P>
<P>
   This morning he awakes as the Most Valuable Player of Saturday
night's Insight.com Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange twist of events, Jones went from a backup
cornerback to being thrust into the starting defensive secondary
after first-string cornerback
 &UR; Wade Perkins was suspended for his final game because he broke an
undisclosed team rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting all year for my chance,'' Jones said. ``I wanted
to take advantage of it if it ever came.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, making his first collegiate start, played the game of his
life. He had an interception, blocked a punt, broke up a handful of
passes and returned three kicks for 72 yards, including a 39-yard
kickoff return in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the MVP?'' Missouri Coach  &UR; Larry Smith asked. ``He should
be. He played a heck of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, a senior, was a second-team All-Big 12 selection. He
was sent home to Las Vegas on Christmas Eve by Smith, known as a
stickler for rules. &QL; 
Insight-ful record
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the biggest reason for the sparse crowd at the
10th Insight.com Bowl was being locked into a Dec. 26 game.
</P>
<P>
   Insight officials conceded this year's game was a tough sell
because the day after Christmas is a difficult time to get many
fans to travel to watch a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri fans bought about 3,000 tickets, while West Virginia's
fans bought around 2,000. An amended figure of 36,147 was announced
more than 30 minutes after an initial report of 33,888. The actual
attendance, by most estimates, was somewhere near 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second-smallest attendance in the history of the
bowl, formerly known as the Copper Bowl. The previous low was set
on Dec. 31, 1991, when 35,751 showed up to watch Indiana beat
Baylor, 24-0. &QL; 
A time for reflecting
</P>
<P>
   With 57 seconds remaining in the first half and Missouri at West
Virginia's 2-yard line, the Tigers took a timeout. Then West
Virginia took a timeout. And then another, to make it three
straight timeouts without a play taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountaineers didn't adjust enough during their back-to-back
timeouts as Missouri quarterback  &UR; Corby Jones then ran in for his
second touchdown of the game on an option play. &QL; 
Before the extra point, Missouri took another timeout, decided to
go for a two-point conversion that gave the Tigers a 24-3 lead. &QL;

TENNESSEE ENDS BREAK, TOUCHES DOWN IN VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - They arrived earlier than usual for a bowl game, but
nobody is faulting the Tennessee Volunteers for being eager to get
here.
</P>
<P>
   Only a national championship is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers, who came to Phoenix from different parts of the
country Saturday after spending Christmas with their families, go
back to work today at Scottsdale Community College in preparation
for the Jan. 4 Fiesta Bowl against Florida State at Sun Devil
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Florida State (11-1) arrives today and begins workouts
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to let them go for Christmas to have some time, but
we told them we want to get back to work,'' Coach Phillip Fulmer
said. ``I didn't want to make them stay out a lot longer than we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer, who arrived on a charter plane Saturday evening with his
family and a large Tennessee group, didn't let up too much before
Christmas, as the weather turned cold in Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer said his team had nine practices, including four days of
two-a-days, before taking a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were short, crisp practices,'' he said. ``We got a lot
out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 12-0 record and top ranking, Tennessee comes here,
in some people's eyes, an underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an unusual role for our team,'' Fulmer said. ``This
team has responded to those kinds of challenges, and I would hope
that they will respond again.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State has been in these scenarios under Coach Bobby
Bowden with the national title on the line before. The Seminoles
won the national championship after beating Nebraska in the 1994
Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, which got rocked by Nebraska, 42-17, in last year's
Orange Bowl, has its first 12-win season in school history. The
Volunteers did it despite having to replace players at key
positions, including quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   There were close calls along the way. A season-opening 34-33
victory over Syracuse, followed by a 20-17 overtime win over
Florida _ both decided by Jeff Hall's foot. A 28-24 win over
Arkansas, thanks to a Razorbacks fumble in the last two minutes.
And a 24-14 victory over Mississippi that put the Volunteers in the
BCS national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go find a national championship game that has two teams
playing in it that weren't a little fortunate along the way,''
Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   They want to make more history.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer believes the BCS works and that the two best teams in
America will be playing Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad to be part of a history-making game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer has talked to his team about the Super Bowl-like hype
that will surround the game. He doesn't feel it will be a
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been ranked first for six straight weeks, so we're not
unaccustomed to dealing with the media and the hype,'' he said. ``I
think our experience from last year, playing against Nebraska,
helps. I think our players are very adept at handling this. They'll
do fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer said he'll let the players enjoy the week's festivities,
but he wants to make sure football is the focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not your typical reward, go to a bowl game and have a
good time,'' he said. ``We're one of only two schools in the whole
country with this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure our focus is good, that our preparation
and concentration are good, that we eat well, we rest well as we
approach the bowl game.'' &QL;

 &HT;    WILLIE NELSON HONORED AT 'WASHINGTON'S OSCARS'
 &HT;    620&AMP;add. Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington and (e)
entertainment categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attire for the Kennedy Center Honors is always
unflinchingly formal, so Willie Nelson arrived in a spiffy black
cowboy hat, shined black boots and black velvet binding the ends of
his braided reddish-gray hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember the last time'' he was so dressed up,
admitted the tuxedoed Texas troubador, who was among this year's
honorees. ``But they sent me a little piece of paper that said,
'You will wear black tie.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Along with Nelson, the Kennedy Center's 21st annual recognition
for lifetime achievement in the performing arts went to Bill Cosby,
Shirley Temple Black, conductor Andre Previn and Broadway composer
John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb. The star-studded salute to the
honorees was videotaped Dec. 6 and will be broadcast on the CBS
television network on Wednesday (Dec. 30) at 9 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called ``Washington's Oscars,'' the Kennedy Center
Honors have recognized 111 American artists ranging from Bob Hope
and Lucille Ball to Paul Newman and Roy Acuff over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   After hosting this year's honorees at a White House reception,
President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton joined them
in box seats at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts
to watch a stage show recalling the winners' artistic careers.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Academy Awards, the evening begins with fans and TV
crews gathered on both sides of a red-carpeted foyer to see the
honorees and other celebrities walk from their limousines to their
theater seats. This promenade featured familiar faces from Capitol
Hill and Hollywood, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., Dennis Hopper; Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; Michelle Lee;
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jack Lemmon. Interesting
couples ranged from Dwight Yoakam and Bridget Fonda to Howard Baker
and Nancy Kassenbaum Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only in Washington _ and certainly only in booming
economic times _ would some of the loudest applause go to Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. ``You da man,
Alan,'' shouted one onlooker as Greenspan passed, looking slightly
perplexed as he walked with his wife, NBC-TV correspondent Andrea
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Cronkite anchored the gala, which featured a videotaped
recap of the achievements of each honoree and then salutes from
their performing peers.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his outlaw brand of country music, Nelson has had some
well-publicized run-ins with the law over marijuana and with the
IRS over unpaid taxes. On this night, though, a lyrical Cronkite
called him ``a Texan whose Dust Bowl voice and songs in the neon
night made him a Walt Whitman of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows who he is _ and he knows he's from someplace _ and he
knows where that place is,'' observed Tommy Lee Jones, a fellow
Texan. ``That big bus is always going back to the Hill Country.''
</P>
<P>
   On this night, though, Nelson's tour bus, the Honeysuckle Rose,
was rolled onto the reinforced Kennedy Center stage for the segment
honoring the Red-Haired Stranger. Then Nelson was serenaded with
his own songs.
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam sang ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain'' and ``Hello
Walls.'' Lyle Lovett sang ``Night Life.'' Shelby Lynne sang
``Crazy'' and provoked some nervous giggles in the audience when
the TV monitors showed the Clintons in their box listening to the
lyrics ``crazy for trying and crazy for crying and crazy for loving
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Kris Kristofferson strolled out, declaring ``Of all of
Willie's songs, this is probably the best epitaph'' and launching
into ``On the Road Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nelson earlier told reporters he was taking his bus back
to Texas and might just drape his seven-ribboned Kennedy Center
Honors medal from the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For this one evening, record producer Don Was put together ``The
Willie Nelson Tribute Band'' featuring himself on bass, Mickey
Raphael from Willie's ``Family'' on harmonica, G.E. Smith from
``Saturday Night Live'' and Reggie Young on guitar, Clifford Carter
on keyboards and Steve Jordan on guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the show include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Broadway salute to Kander and Ebb featuring songs from two
of their top hits, ``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago.'' Bebe Neuwirth
(familiar as Lillith from ``Cheers'' and ``Frazier'') and Chita
Rivera dance and sing a ``Chicago'' medley and Joel Gray and Liza
Minelli reprise their ``Cabaret'' roles for a nostalgic number.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sinbad's hilarious rag on Cosby. On an evening of effusive
praise, Sinbad's outrageous tales of sharing a foxhole in Vietnam
with Cosby, saving his life and then being treated abominably by
the beloved comedian had Cosby pretending to climb out of his box
seat and later waving a white flag of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   _ A heartfelt tribute to Previn by Mia Farrow, his ex-wife.
``Thanks for the music, Toots, and for the memories,'' she said.

 &HT;    WILLIE NELSON HONORED AT 'WASHINGTON'S OSCARS'
 &HT;    620&AMP;add. Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington and (e)
entertainment categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attire for the Kennedy Center Honors is always
unflinchingly formal, so Willie Nelson arrived in a spiffy black
cowboy hat, shined black boots and black velvet binding the ends of
his braided reddish-gray hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember the last time'' he was so dressed up,
admitted the tuxedoed Texas troubador, who was among this year's
honorees. ``But they sent me a little piece of paper that said,
'You will wear black tie.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Along with Nelson, the Kennedy Center's 21st annual recognition
for lifetime achievement in the performing arts went to Bill Cosby,
Shirley Temple Black, conductor Andre Previn and Broadway composer
John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb. The star-studded salute to the
honorees was videotaped Dec. 6 and will be broadcast on the CBS
television network on Wednesday (Dec. 30) at 9 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called ``Washington's Oscars,'' the Kennedy Center
Honors have recognized 111 American artists ranging from Bob Hope
and Lucille Ball to Paul Newman and Roy Acuff over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   After hosting this year's honorees at a White House reception,
President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton joined them
in box seats at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts
to watch a stage show recalling the winners' artistic careers.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Academy Awards, the evening begins with fans and TV
crews gathered on both sides of a red-carpeted foyer to see the
honorees and other celebrities walk from their limousines to their
theater seats. This promenade featured familiar faces from Capitol
Hill and Hollywood, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., Dennis Hopper; Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; Michelle Lee;
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jack Lemmon. Interesting
couples ranged from Dwight Yoakam and Bridget Fonda to Howard Baker
and Nancy Kassenbaum Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only in Washington _ and certainly only in booming
economic times _ would some of the loudest applause go to Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. ``You da man,
Alan,'' shouted one onlooker as Greenspan passed, looking slightly
perplexed as he walked with his wife, NBC-TV correspondent Andrea
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Cronkite anchored the gala, which featured a videotaped
recap of the achievements of each honoree and then salutes from
their performing peers.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his outlaw brand of country music, Nelson has had some
well-publicized run-ins with the law over marijuana and with the
IRS over unpaid taxes. On this night, though, a lyrical Cronkite
called him ``a Texan whose Dust Bowl voice and songs in the neon
night made him a Walt Whitman of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows who he is _ and he knows he's from someplace _ and he
knows where that place is,'' observed Tommy Lee Jones, a fellow
Texan. ``That big bus is always going back to the Hill Country.''
</P>
<P>
   On this night, though, Nelson's tour bus, the Honeysuckle Rose,
was rolled onto the reinforced Kennedy Center stage for the segment
honoring the Red-Haired Stranger. Then Nelson was serenaded with
his own songs.
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam sang ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain'' and ``Hello
Walls.'' Lyle Lovett sang ``Night Life.'' Shelby Lynne sang
``Crazy'' and provoked some nervous giggles in the audience when
the TV monitors showed the Clintons in their box listening to the
lyrics ``crazy for trying and crazy for crying and crazy for loving
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Kris Kristofferson strolled out, declaring ``Of all of
Willie's songs, this is probably the best epitaph'' and launching
into ``On the Road Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nelson earlier told reporters he was taking his bus back
to Texas and might just drape his seven-ribboned Kennedy Center
Honors medal from the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For this one evening, record producer Don Was put together ``The
Willie Nelson Tribute Band'' featuring himself on bass, Mickey
Raphael from Willie's ``Family'' on harmonica, G.E. Smith from
``Saturday Night Live'' and Reggie Young on guitar, Clifford Carter
on keyboards and Steve Jordan on guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the show include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Broadway salute to Kander and Ebb featuring songs from two
of their top hits, ``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago.'' Bebe Neuwirth
(familiar as Lillith from ``Cheers'' and ``Frazier'') and Chita
Rivera dance and sing a ``Chicago'' medley and Joel Gray and Liza
Minelli reprise their ``Cabaret'' roles for a nostalgic number.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sinbad's hilarious rag on Cosby. On an evening of effusive
praise, Sinbad's outrageous tales of sharing a foxhole in Vietnam
with Cosby, saving his life and then being treated abominably by
the beloved comedian had Cosby pretending to climb out of his box
seat and later waving a white flag of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   _ A heartfelt tribute to Previn by Mia Farrow, his ex-wife.
``Thanks for the music, Toots, and for the memories,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cronkite recalled Shirley Temple Black from the era of the
Great Depression as ``a little child who lit up the screen, lifted
up the nation and will always be America's princess.'' Later, Jack
Lemmon added his deadpan salute: ``The first drink I ever had was a
Shirley Temple.'' And Henry Kissinger remembered being secretary of
state while the former child star served as U.S. ambassador to
Ghana. Growing up, he had her movies dubbed in German, Kissinger
said, ``so I was surprised when she spoke English _ and without an
accent.''
</P>
<P>
   The show concludes with a bemused Cronkite sharing a stage with
scores of tap-dancing kids as the U.S. Air Force Band plays ``On
the Good Ship Lollipop'' and hundreds of red, white and blue
balloons fall from the ceiling.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; CIRCUMNAVIGATION &LR;  By Steve Lattimore. Houghton Mifflin, $12.
The author's first collection of short stories is populated by
disaffected Californians stuck with menial jobs, empty lives and
dead-end relationships. In 1997 the New York Times reviewer Scott
Bradfield called this a ``funny, moving book'' that in its best
moments is ``about the various jangled ways in which broken
families manage to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SLAVES IN THE FAMILY &LR;  By Edward Ball. Ballantine, $15.95.
Searching for the descendants of slaves owned by his ancestors in
South Carolina, the author confronts his heritage and the moral
consequences of slavery. His account, which won a National Book
Award last year, took him across America and to Africa, and
involved extensive interviews and research. ``There is much to
admire in Ball's very willingness to challenge the generations of
silence in his white family and to search out black kin whose
reactions he had every reason to fear,'' Drew Gilpin Faust wrote in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TO 'JOY MY FREEDOM: SOUTHERN BLACK WOMEN'S LIVES AND LABORS
AFTER THE CIVIL WAR &LR;  By Tera W. Hunter. Harvard University, $15.95.
A history professor explores the valuable political and social role
played by black women after Emancipation. In 1997 the same reviewer
called this a ``celebration of struggle and resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COCKROACH BASKETBALL LEAGUE &LR;  By Charley Rosen. Seven
Stories, $13.95. This hymn to minor-league basketball follows a
team of misfits and whining wannabes as they ply their trade in the
shadow of the big time. The result is ``a racily entertaining
novel'' that ``skillfully induces the reader to join `the
Brotherhood of the Sacred Hoop,''' Michael Anderson wrote in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GEORGE ELIOT: A LIFE &LR;  By Rosemary Ashton. Penguin, $15.95. This
revisionist biography combines the social context of Eliot's
fiction and a detailed analysis of her novels. ``Ashton is a
serious, persistent scholar, and the picture she gives of Eliot's
intellectual and emotional life is convincing,'' William S.
Peterson wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANE AUSTEN: A LIFE &LR;  By David Nokes. University of California,
$19.95. This reveals how the novelist wielded irony and razor-sharp
observation as weapons to skewer the constraining society in which
she lived. In 1997 the reviewer Claude Rawson praised the author
for leaning heavily on Austen's letters, which ``are wonderfully
revealing, especially strong on the texture of relationships and
the tang of social encounters.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PRINCE OF PEACE &LR;  By James Carroll. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin,
$13. This densely plotted novel tells the parallel tales of an
American priest who gets caught up in the anti-Vietnam War movement
and what is portrayed as the metamorphosis of the Roman Catholic
Church in the United States into a cynically run corporation. ``The
stories are nearly irresistible,'' Webster Schott wrote in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASPHALT NATION: HOW THE AUTOMOBILE TOOK OVER AMERICA, AND HOW
WE CAN TAKE IT BACK &LR;  By Jane Holtz Kay. University of California,
$16.95. In this cranky polemic, an architecture critic describes
how unchecked motorized sprawl is threatening the nation's cities
and towns, its economy and its health. She ``largely succeeds in
proving that it is possible to get where we are going without
destroying where we live,'' Kenneth T. Jackson wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EATING CHINESE FOOD NAKED &LR;  By Mei Ng. Washington Square/Pocket
Books, $14. Ruby Lee is a restless college graduate whose
protective love for her mother draws her back to her father's
laundry in Queens. Last year the reviewer Lynn Karpen called this
an ``affecting first novel'' that ``conveys the complexities of
family life with vibrant color and luminosity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOBBY REX'S GREATEST HIT &LR;  By Marianne Gingher. Louisiana State
University, $14.95. It's 1961 in Greensboro, N.C., and Pally
Thompson is about to marry a man who wants to know how far she went
with a local country-music crooner whose hit song is all about his
romance with her. This ``richly detailed, often charming first
novel ... lovingly evokes Pally's journey from innocence to
maturity in a town where gossip flourishes and ambitions fade,''
Ellen Pall wrote in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITIZEN SOLDIERS: THE U.S. ARMY FROM THE NORMANDY BEACHES TO
THE BULGE TO THE SURRENDER OF GERMANY. JUNE 7, 1944-MAY 7, 1945 &LR;  By
Stephen E. Ambrose. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $16. In this
sequel to ``D-Day,'' the author's 1994 best seller about the
Normandy landing, he once again uses the experiences of ordinary
soldiers to recreate the bloody, often nameless battles that led to
the Nazi defeat. ```Citizen Soldiers' is an unforgettable testament
to the World War II generation,'' Carlo D'Este wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GOD'S SNAKE &LR;  By Irini Spanidou. Vintage International, $13. A
girl chronicles her anguished coming of age in Greece in the 1950s
as the daughter of an inflexible military officer who treats her as
if she were one of his recruits. This first novel ``freshly evokes
the beauties and terrors of childhood,'' Nicholas Bromell wrote in
1986.

 &HT;    Vols-FSU a clash of destinies
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ There are a number of very good reasons why No. 1
Tennessee feels it will beat No. 2 Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl
and win its first national championship since 1951. But the most
compelling reason, say the Volunteer players, has nothing to do
with offense, defense or kicking.
</P>
<P>
   Some are calling it Fate. Others are calling it Destiny. Still
others can't put a name to it. They just know how they feel. After
everything Tennessee has overcome this season to go 12-0 and reach
the national championship game, they simply believe _ right down to
the core of their Big Orange soul _ that it is meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I believe in destiny. I believe in it a lot,'' said
Tennessee linebacker Al Wilson, who arrived here with his teammates
on Dec. 26 to get ready for the Jan. 4 game. ``If you've watched
this team since last spring and summer, when we were pushing each
other in the weight room, you'd understand why we think this team
is special. We think we were meant to be here and win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even coach Phillip Fulmer, who is not prone to overstatement,
believes this a special team. Because of the adversity it has
survived, the whole, Fulmer says, is greater then the sum of its
parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them in the spring that we didn't have to be the best
team in the country,'' said Fulmer. ``We just had to be the best
team on the 12 or 13 days that we played. And that is exactly what
this team has done. They have always gotten the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee began this season without the greatest quarterback in
its history, Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Vols found a way to win:
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeff Hall kicked a 27-yard field goal as time expired to give
Tennessee a 34-33 win at Syracuse in the opener. The Vols drove the
length of the field to set up the winning score.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hall's 41-yard field goal in overtime beat Florida 20-17,
snapping a five-game losing streak to the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Then, four weeks into the 1998 campaign, the Volunteers lost
their best offensive player, running back Jamal Lewis, to a knee
injury. The Vols kept winning:
</P>
<P>
   _ In their first game without Lewis, the Volunteers went on the
road and dominated No. 7 Georgia, 22-3. The defense held Georgia to
59 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Arkansas quarterback Clint Stoerner fumbled with less
than two minutes left, Tennessee drove and scored a touchdown with
28 seconds remaining to beat the Razorbacks 28-24.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trailing 14-10 to Mississippi State with 8:43 to go,
quarterback Tee Martin threw touchdown passes for 41 and 26 yards
to beat the Bulldogs 24-14 in the SEC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much stuff has happened to this team but we never quit,''
said wide receiver Peerless Price. ``We always believe we're going
to win. We still believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute, said Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, who
thinks his No. 2 Seminoles have a little destiny on their side as
well.
</P>
<P>
   What else do you call it when a team gets embarrassed on Sept.
12 (with a 24-7 loss to N.C. State) and almost four months later is
playing for all the marbles?
</P>
<P>
   What else do you call it when a team loses its quarterback
(Chris Weinke, neck injury) on Nov. 7, but is still favored against
the No. 1 team in the land?
</P>
<P>
   And what else do you call it when you're ranked No. 4 on the
last day of the regular season, and both No. 2 (Kansas State) and
No. 3 (UCLA) are upset?
</P>
<P>
   ``When we lost to N.C. State I figured it we had no shot of
getting back into this thing,'' said Bowden, who is 16-4-1 in bowl
games and 2-0 in the Fiesta Bowl. ``But I remembered what happened
to Florida in 1996. I told our guys `let's keep winning so we'll be
there in case an opportunity presents itself.' And that's exactly
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Florida lost its regular-season finale to Florida State
but got into position to win the national title due to a series of
upsets.
</P>
<P>
   After the loss to N.C. State, Florida State proceeded to win 10
straight games against the nation's No. 4-rated schedule. The
Seminoles had not played since Nov. 21 when Kansas State and UCLA
lost on Dec. 5. Bowden went to bed that Saturday night knowing he
was about to be given an unexpected Christmas gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get an opportunity like this, something this
unexpected, you really want to take advantage of it,'' said Bowden,
whose only national title came in 1993. ``But it feels like we were
meant to be here.''

 &HT;    Austin's poor pay more for insurance
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Vehicles owned by people in poorer parts of
Austin are twice as likely as those in more affluent areas to be
covered by higher-cost auto insurance, even though there's little
evidence that lower-income people are worse drivers,
American-Statesman research has found.
</P>
<P>
   Companies selling those higher-priced policies also appear to be
gaining market share in more affluent parts of the city, the
research shows.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies, called county mutuals, generally sell insurance
to people with poor driving records. Their rates are not regulated
by the state. So-called standard and preferred companies, whose
rates are regulated, generally sell lower-cost policies to better
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   On average, county mutual policies in 1997 cost $1,300 for a
year's coverage, $500 more than those offered by preferred and
standard companies, according to the Texas Department of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers and their representatives strongly deny any deliberate
tie between their customers' income and the policies and prices
they are offered. They say the findings might boil down to a simple
coincidence that people in lower- and moderate-income areas more
often have less-than-perfect driving records.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems to be where the people with the most tickets and
accidents happen to live,'' said Jerry Johns, president of
Southwestern Insurance Information Service, an industry trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   But Birny Birnbaum, an insurance data analyst who has conducted
similar research, says it's unlikely that the difference between
the number of county mutual policies sold in low-income areas and
those sold in more affluent areas happens by chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results are not random,'' Birnbaum said. ``There is a
clear and statistically powerful relationship between the
availability of standard coverage and where you live. Whether it is
intentional or unintentional, it has the same result, which is to
systematically deny standard, low-cost coverage to those who most
need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like consumer advocates, Southeast Austin resident Jack Straube
believes there might be some intentional discrimination based on
people's income and where they live. Straube thought he was getting
a good rate from his insurer, a small county mutual, before finding
out that he could do better.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers say they do their best to give good rates to good
drivers. At the same time, companies refuse to release information
about their sales and cancellations. They contend that if insurers
knew each other's strategies and sales, competition would be
compromised, ultimately hurting consumers. Research results The
American-Statesman's study relied on industrywide insurance sales
records, which are public. Overall, the research showed that in the
ZIP codes with the lowest median after-tax household income, county
mutuals provided liability coverage on almost 33 percent of the
insured vehicles. In the ZIP codes with the highest median incomes,
they covered 16 percent of the insured vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity was even more striking when individual ZIP codes
were examined.
</P>
<P>
   For example, from January to March of this year, county mutuals
covered 121 of every 1,000 insured vehicles in the 78730 ZIP code.
Residents in that part of Northwest Austin and western Travis
County have a median disposable household income of $83,653
annually, among the area's highest, according to 1998 data.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, county mutuals provided liability insurance to
410 of every 1,000 insured vehicles in the 78741 ZIP code in
Southeast Austin, where the median income of $19,043 is among the
city's lowest.
</P>
<P>
   Liability insurance is the only coverage all Texas drivers are
required to purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The often high cost of liability insurance in low-income areas,
which prices some drivers out of the market, should be a concern
for all drivers, consumer advocates say. That's because as many as
one in four drivers doesn't carry liability insurance, according to
estimates from the Department of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   That means drivers with insurance face higher costs to protect
themselves from under-insured and uninsured drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Statesman's study also found another concern for drivers in
more affluent areas: County mutuals' share of vehicles throughout
the city grew from the first quarter of 1996 to the same period in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the 78730 ZIP code, for example, county mutuals increased
their market share of liability policies from 87 to 121 vehicles
per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the 78741 ZIP code, county mutuals' liability coverage
increased from 308 to 410 vehicles per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent growth of county mutual sales could be skewed by a
recent change at USAA insurance. In late 1995 and 1996, the company
moved many of its customers into its county mutual; it said the
reason was to have more flexibility in setting rates. Most of the
people who were shifted continued to get low rates, the company
said, adding that for some, costs dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The company would not release information that would make more
clear what effect its shift of customers had on the overall growth
of county mutuals. Case for county mutuals At Farmers Insurance,
spokesman Mark Toohey said that without exception, its county
mutual insures drivers with tickets and wrecks. They are charged a
higher price because they are more likely to cause more wrecks and
get more tickets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only litmus test for our county mutual is whether the
driver has a bad driving record,'' Toohey said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that despite the Statesman's findings, Farmers'
preferred company has grown in the past two years. Farmers' county
mutual has fewer customers now than it had in 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Toohey could not say, however, what share of Farmers' county
mutual policies are sold in low- and moderate-income areas and how
that compares with the number of policies sold in more affluent
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have that information,'' he said of income data.
``We wouldn't care about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers and other companies do ask customers about their income.
But Toohey and other industry officials said it is not to determine
rates. In many cases, the information is used to determine whether
a customer will be offered a payment plan.
</P>
<P>
   For years, county mutual companies have been the primary
insurers for people who have wrecks and tickets on their record.
Among other things, insurance companies look at Department of
Public Safety records three years back for such problems and
consider the number and severity of wrecks and tickets when
determining the risk a driver poses.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Schneider, a senior policy analyst for Consumers Union, said
that when used properly _ only to insure bad drivers _ county
mutuals play an important role in keeping good drivers from paying
higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have had a lot of wrecks or a DWI ought to pay
according to the risk they pose,'' Schneider said. ``People who
have good driving records don't deserve to pay more for
insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates say they believe lower-priced insurers
are using county mutuals to dump drivers they don't want, such as
the poor and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, insurers say.
</P>
<P>
   Johns, of Southwestern Insurance Information Service, said
response to the state's Market Assistance Program provides evidence
that low-income and minority Texans don't experience illegal
discrimination. The Texas Department of Insurance program helps
connect good drivers in underserved ZIP codes with companies that
offer better rates. The department defines underserved areas as
those where a disproportionate number of drivers are insured by
county mutuals or the Texas Automobile Insurance Plan, a program
for the worst drivers.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 7, the Department of Insurance said 1,594 Texans had
sought help from the Market Assistance Program, which began in July
in parts of Austin, El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance critics say there are auto insurance availability
problems in Texas, but the poor response to the MAP would indicate
otherwise,'' Johns said. ``For a very small number of Texas
drivers, the MAP is working. But for the majority of people, they
seem well-satisfied with their insurance company.'' Good drivers,
bad rates Straube, a carpenter who lives in the 78741 ZIP code in
Southeast Austin, was not one of those satisfied customers. News
accounts of the Market Assistance Program prompted him to look for
a better rate.
</P>
<P>
   Straube, 53, hasn't had a wreck or gotten a ticket in more than
three years, a standard mark of a good driver.
</P>
<P>
   He was with his last insurance company, Home State County
Mutual, for several years. After shopping around, he found that the
Farm Bureau was able to cut his rate by more than half, from $77 a
month to about $33.
</P>
<P>
   Before switching, Straube initially chose his insurer from the
phone book. He reasoned that agencies and companies with prominent
advertising in the phone book and located in his neighborhood
offered better rates than larger, national companies, Straube said.
</P>
<P>
   A look at Austin's phone book found that many of the most
prominent insurance ads are from independent agencies that
primarily sell county mutual policies.
</P>
<P>
   Straube believes questions about income and where customers live
shouldn't be asked before rates are determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why your income or where you live has anything to
do with your driving record,'' he said. ``They need your ZIP code
to communicate with you, but to give you a rate, they don't need
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Straube encourages others to use the Market Assistance Program
and says laws should be changed to ensure that good drivers get
good rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't be able to determine what a person pays because
of their income or their color or anything,'' Straube said of
insurers. ``It should be determined on your driving record.''

 &HT;    Religious see spiritual omens in predictions
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ At the front of the pulpit at Christian
Family Church in Stuart, the Rev. Scott Scheer displays a digital
clock that counts down the days, hours, minutes and seconds until
Jan. 1, 2000, arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Scheer sees spiritual significance in the warnings of secular
prophets who say the year 2000 computer problem _ also called Y2K
or the millennium bug _ could wreak worldwide chaos by disrupting
utilities, communications, commerce, financial institutions and
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely we believe it's going to be a trying time and a
testing time,'' says Scheer, whose charismatic congregation has
about 300 members.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a time when more people seek God, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, Scheer says, the millennium bug is a harbinger of the
tribulation period he believes will precede the return of Jesus
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Scheer and other charismatic and evangelical Christians have
become some of the most active preachers of Y2K awareness and
preparedness over the past year. Christian Internet sites,
publications, radio and TV programs, televangelist videos, seminars
and sermons have exploded with Y2K messages ranging from practical
preparedness tips to apocalypticism.
</P>
<P>
   But as Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, James Dobson and other
Christian broadcasters spread the Y2K word to millions, secular
veterans of the Y2K circuit have mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Early Y2K alarmist Peter de Jager, who for years was a voice in
the wilderness bemoaning the public's lack of attention to the
problem, now says he's ``very, very nervous'' that Christian
doomsayers will help create unwarranted panic.
</P>
<P>
   Since writing the seminal ``Doomsday 2000'' article in
Computerworld magazine in 1993, de Jager is accustomed to being
branded a scaremonger. But when he appeared at an October Y2K
conference sponsored by Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network,
his views weren't dire enough for many attendees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks have been sold on the idea that this is the end of the
world,'' says de Jager, who does believe Y2K will bring four to six
weeks of worldwide disruptions. ``This is the first audience I've
been in where I was considered a Pollyanna.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say Christian outlets have played a valuable role in
raising awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very, very little of what I see is the hard-line, apocalyptic,
end-of-the-world message,'' says Ed Yourdon, who says he has done
as many as 100 interviews with Christian radio and TV programs
while plugging his book Time Bomb 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Jump-started groups
</P>
<P>
   Paloma O'Reilly, founder of a secular Y2K preparedness
information clearinghouse called the Cassandra Project, said she
reluctantly appeared on Robertson's 700 Club when it did a
millennium bug special in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I did. I can tell you that jump-started a lot of
groups,'' O'Reilly said. ``I know every time they show it (again)
because the numbers jump on the Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, who regularly features millennium bug news on CBN and
its Internet site, doesn't believe Y2K fits into biblical
end-of-the-world prophecy, a CBN spokeswoman said. He and Christian
groups like Joseph Project 2000 have said the hardships the
millennium bug might cause should be viewed by Christians as an
opportunity to minister to others and spread the gospel.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem is the notorious programming blind spot
that makes many computers unable to handle the change from 1999 to
2000. Because years are traditionally entered only by their last
two digits, the rollover from 99 to 00 will cause many computers
that haven't been reprogrammed to assume it's 1900 and either shut
down or produce bad information.
</P>
<P>
   Governments and businesses are spending billions of dollars to
address Y2K, but there's little agreement on how successful they
will be.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most widely cited Y2K consultants, Connecticut-based
GartnerGroup, recently said 90 percent of millennium bug problems
should be corrected within three days of Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``A `bomb shelter' mentality is not called for,'' an Oct. 28
report said. But individuals should keep two weeks' salary in cash
on hand and a five-day supply of food, medicine and fuel as a
precaution, the report advised.
</P>
<P>
   Many bracing for the worst
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross recently offered similar advice,
recommending that people stock up to a week of disaster supplies
and some extra cash.
</P>
<P>
   Many are bracing for worse. There is a small but growing Y2K
preparedness movement around the nation that began with
survivalists and militia types but has gone mainstream. At meetings
and on the Internet, the concerned share tips on stockpiling food,
storing water and coping with potential disruptions to electricity
and other services.
</P>
<P>
   Blane Land, a computer consultant who runs a secular Y2K Web
site out of Pensacola, says those who are most serious about Y2K
preparation are usually serious about their Christian beliefs as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people that I've had direct contact with, and
I'm talking about hundreds, happen to be oriented that way,'' Land
said. ``It's curious to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheer, whose church in Stuart has begun hosting millennium bug
preparedness meetings every other Saturday evening, offers an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you study the Word, there is that constant awareness of
destruction and tribulation that is coming,'' says Scheer, who says
he doesn't necessarily fit Y2K into an end-time scenario. ``I don't
want to believe it. But I'd rather prepare and have the
insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the apocalyptic element, the idea of one of
mankind's greatest technological accomplishments being laid low by
simple human shortsightedness carries a spiritual lesson for some.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer is the most visible symbol of our technological
society and the earthly attempt to create a utopia without God,''
says Stephen O'Leary, a University of Southern California professor
who specializes in religious communication and tracks
turn-of-the-millennium phenomena. He's also on the board of
directors of the Boston-based Center for Millennial Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story is almost too delicious for someone who is a
religiously minded critic of secular society,'' O'Leary says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Falwell has said Y2K may be God's judgment on an immoral
society grown arrogant because of its wealth and technological
might.
</P>
<P>
   ``God may use the year 2000 computer crisis to crush us and
prepare us for revival,'' Falwell says on a $28.95 video collection
of recent sermons called Y2K: A Christian's Guide to the Millennium
Bug.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell lists ammunition among the supplies Christians should
consider stocking in case the worst Y2K scenarios of shortages and
civil unrest come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am blessed with a little food and my family's inside the
house with me, I've got to be sure that I can persuade others not
to mess with us. Now, I wouldn't want to hurt anybody, but I
wouldn't want to let anybody hurt me. So we'd have to pray about
that,'' Falwell says on the video.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell's is one of several Christian Y2K products on the
market. An Illinois megachurch, the Midwest Christian Center,
advertises a $39.95 series of eight Y2K audio tapes. Oregon
docuvangelist Ken Klein sells a $19.95 video explaining Y2K and its
possible prophetic significance, plus a $129.95 follow-up video
series on family Y2K preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Televangelist Jack Van Impe sells a $24.95 ``emergency video''
called 2000 Time Bomb that ties the millennium bug to end-time
prophecies in the New Testament book of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the calamities predicted by most of the secular experts
happen, the panic in the aftermath could easily lead to the rise of
the Antichrist, the one-world government, and the `mark of the
beast,' '' Van Impe declared on his Web site in an October Y2K
update. ``Friends, closing time is near! Maranatha _ the Lord is
coming!''
</P>
<P>
   Van Impe is referring to the 13th chapter of Revelation, which
describes the rise of a blasphemous beast who rules the Earth and
forces all mankind to receive a mark on the right hand or forehead
to engage in commerce.
</P>
<P>
   For some apocalypticists, Y2K presents a perfect opportunity for
the beast to emerge as an evil Mr. Fixit who solves the world's
computer problems and consolidates political power in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christians enjoy these scenarios as a kind of wishful
thinking, says Steve Hewitt, an ordained Baptist minister who
publishes Christian Computing magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K almost promises the beginning of a tribulation, which
excites people. . . . The more bad news, the better,'' Hewitt says.
He doesn't believe Y2K is a significant problem _ a view that had
him outnumbered 4-to-1 when he participated in a recent Y2K panel
discussion on Dobson's nationally syndicated Focus on the Family
radio program.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt says too many Christian leaders are preoccupied with Y2K
and that is hurting their attempts to present the gospel to
nonbelievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening now is just criminal,'' Hewitt says. ``I
think we're continuing to lose our credibility. We're totally
sidetracked.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Christians who disagree with Hewitt on the severity of the
Y2K problem agree with him about Christians being sidetracked.
</P>
<P>
   Reach out to others
</P>
<P>
   Instead of arguing over interpretations of end-time prophecy or
adopting a bunker mentality, Christians should reach out to others,
says Kate Allen, executive director of the inter-denominational
Joseph Project.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based group takes its name from the Joseph of Old
Testament many-colored coat fame who, after being sold into slavery
in Egypt, foresaw a seven-year famine and advised Pharaoh to
prepare by storing a seven-year supply of grain.
</P>
<P>
   The Joseph Project advises Christians to ``store to reach out to
the community and minister to them in the time of need,'' says
Allen. ``We're urging both individual churches as well as families
to store enough to share.''
</P>
<P>
   The group doesn't take a position on how long a period to
prepare for. But Allen says those who store too much can easily
find places to give it away once the Y2K threat passes.
</P>
<P>
   That's the philosophy of Dave Miller who is laying up a
three-month supply of beans and rice in the utility room of his
suburban West Palm Beach home. He's also rigged up a
water-purification system and plans to stock up on canned goods in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   An elder at the Grace Christian Fellowship near Palm Springs,
Miller expects Y2K to be a ``significant'' event and a major
opportunity for the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the church should get ready to minister, basically,
and show the love of Christ and not run away,'' he said. ``It's a
lot easier to tell someone about Jesus if you hand them something
to eat.''

   MTV-TEEN-SCREAMERS (New York) _ ``Sometimes you say you're not
going to scream, but then you do,'' said Karen Lopez, 14, as she
angled for a glimpse of a wayward elbow, a Fubu jacket or anything
else signifying the presence of the group 'N Sync, which was
gracing the MTV studios one story above her in Times Square. On a
regular basis young fans, most of them teen-aged girls, regularly
line the streets of Broadway hoping to glimpse the acts that show
up for MTV's ``Total Request Live,'' from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET. By
Peter Applebome.

<P>
   JEWISH-MUSEUM-FRANCE (Paris) _ In a country already crowded with
museums dedicated to every imaginable topic, it was at the very
least strange that until now France had no Jewish museum worthy of
the name. This month, President Jacques Chirac inaugurated the new
Museum of the Art and History of Judaism in the Marais, the old
Jewish quarter of Paris. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   TV-RACIAL-DIVIDE (Los Angeles) Prime-time television has rarely
been as racially divided as it is today, both in terms of casts and
audiences. Because whites rarely watch shows with largely black

integrated casts in prime time. By James Sterngold.
</P>

   BARRY-WRITER-PROFILE (Undated) _ Although novelists have written
plays, and playwrights have written novels, it is rare for a writer

Samuel Beckett. But at 43, Beckett's countryman Sebastian Barry
seems well on his way to such an accomplishment. By Mel Gussow.
</P>
<P>
   RADIO-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Until I read Gerald Nachman's

by that ubiquitous box of sounds, or how radio shaped our language,
conversation and dreams. Reviewed by Mel Gussow.

Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-EVOLUTION _ Centralized intelligence, accessible via
fast computer networks, would pose a threat to the dominant role of
personal computers. That challenge to the PC seems to be at hand.
But whether that shift is the beginning of a revolutionary
transformation or an evolutionary progression is a matter of fierce
debate. By Steve Lohr and John Markoff.

   DIGICOM-COLUMN _ Those who successfully pushed for passage in

</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-MARKETPLACE _ In the Internet business, the forces
propelling the leading companies like America Online, Yahoo and
Amazon.com remained the same throughout the year _ even if the pace

That is not only good news, but, criminologists say, provides an

NEW UPI CHIEF WANTS TO GO WHERE OTHERS AREN'T 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Helen Thomas has covered the White House for United Press
International since the Kennedy administration, but in recent
years, as the once-proud news agency withered, one could search
through hundreds of American newspapers without finding her byline
or her copy. What readers she has are mostly in Japan or scrolling
through the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues ask the 78-year-old Ms. Thomas what
became of the organization that in its heyday was the first to tell
the world about Kennedy's assassination. She answers, ruefully, ``I
make it a point not to know.'' Then, with a mixture of defiance and
verve, she adds, ``My joy is that we're still in business and we're
alive.'' When she calls the office, she said, she is happy to know
that ``someone answers on the other end.''
</P>
<P>
   Not always the same someone, however. UPI, an organization whose
chief executives seem to have a shelf life only slightly longer
than a piece of wire copy, has named Arnaud de Borchgrave as
president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   De Borchgrave, 72, who made his name synonymous with diplomatic
reporting during 30 years at Newsweek and later edited The
Washington Times, is rejoining a service that is a barely
recognizable remnant of the Scripps Howard-owned, globe-spanning
wire service he worked for in 1947, when he succeeded Walter
Cronkite as UPI's Brussels bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Washington, Chicago and a few other cities, UPI
correspondents work in ``virtual bureaus'' (translation: home
offices, or their kitchen tables), filing dispatches daily for
clients that tend to be Web sites and local radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Counting interim managers, de Borchgrave will be the sixth head
of the beleaguered news agency since 1992, when it was purchased by
the Middle East Broadcasting Center Ltd., whose principal owner,
Sheik Walid al-Ibrahim, is a brother-in-law of King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   De Borchgrave, who said he took the job after an interview with
Sheik Walid in London, inherits an organization that has lost $120
million in five years, according to his predecessor, James Adams.
The editor in chief, Susan Older, and Tobin Beck, a managing
editor, say de Borchgrave inherits a staff of about 150 journalists
_ a tenth the number in 1982 _ and another 200 stringers.
</P>
<P>
   That staff _ still bruised by Adams' speech at a public forum
describing UPI as a ``sclerotic, corrupted organization'' populated
by ``tired hacks'' _ along with an annual budget that a top editor
put at $23 million, are the tools de Borchgrave has. His goal is to
take the news service ``upscale'' and to cover ``critically
important news that others are ignoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from his vacation home in Palm Beach,
Fla., de Borchgrave mentioned other wire services with a hint of
disdain. ``I don't see why you would need another Reuters, AP or
Bloomberg,'' he said. ``I'm going to try to go in another
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The direction, he added, would be ``nonideological.'' In June
1991, he left his job as editor of The Washington Times, a
newspaper controlled by the Korean evangelist Rev. Sun Myung Moon,
which has since its inception offered acerbic coverage of
Democratic politicians and generally respectful coverage of
conservative Republicans and their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised on issues; I was not raised on scandal,'' de
Borchgrave said. ``That's where I drifted apart from my younger
reporters at The Washington Times. What was going on in somebody's
basement was never of interest to me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What has been of interest to him, in the seven years he has
spent at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
Washington research center, has been electronic warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Among the events he regards as undercovered in the last two year
_ the kind of events he would like to see at the top of UPI's
agenda _ was President Clinton's comment in a May commencement
address to the U.S. Naval Academy that attacks on government
information systems from international adversaries were a growing
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been the lead to my story,'' de Borchgrave said.
``And I would have said, `Who the hell is attacking us?'''
</P>
<P>
   His challenge is partly financial; his predecessor had
complained to colleagues that the payments from London were often
late. Asked if a particular scheduled payment from UPI's investors
had been late, Adams, who left in August after 14 months in the
post, said, ``The use of the singular in that question is not
appropriate.'' But he would not comment on the record about UPI
management's financial dealings with its Saudi owners.
</P>
<P>
   De Borchgrave, however, said, ``The funds are in the bank for
the next two years.'' He added, ``And I have a five-year
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The new UPI chief is taking over an organization with top
editors who say they were shell-shocked by the short, pyrotechnic
tenure of Adams, a former editor at The Sunday Times of London, a
tenure chronicled in detail in the Dec. 19 issue of Editor &AMP;
Publisher magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was remembered by top UPI editors interviewed last week as
a believer in self-actualization sessions for management,
power-point presentations for the rest of the staff and news
releases like the one that began: ``James Adams. In the world of
journalism, his name is synonymous with vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, in a telephone interview, said he had tried to create a
sense of vision and camaraderie at UPI and new kinds of coverage,
like in-depth reports on auto racing. But, he added, ``Reforming a
company is not a casualty-free exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Older, UPI's editor in chief, said she was happy ``that we
have someone of de Borchgrave's caliber coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   UPI, she said, is ``so far down'' that ``you don't have to knock
down too many buildings to rebuild it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   At a private meeting with executives of Intel Corp. in July
1995, Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., sounded a warning.
As the companies pursued their joint vision of making desktop
machines that could store and crunch ever-increasing amounts of
digital data, Gates predicted they would face a looming challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once networks are extremely fast,'' Gates said, there was ``no
reason intelligence can't be central,'' according to notes taken by
an Intel executive at the meeting, which were submitted as evidence
in the Microsoft antitrust trial. Centralized intelligence,
accessible via fast computer networks, would pose a threat to the
dominant role of PCs _ the model on which Microsoft and Intel had
built their lucrative businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Just three and a half years later, that challenge to the
personal computer seems to be at hand. Even Andrew Grove, the Intel
chairman, acknowledges that ``the center of gravity is shifting.''
But whether that shift is the beginning of a revolutionary
transformation or an evolutionary progression is a matter of fierce
debate.
</P>
<P>
   In one camp are the executives and technologists who argue that
computing is entering ``the post-PC era,'' as advances on many
fronts enable a world of intelligent networks, linked by powerful
hub computers, feeding data to millions upon millions of so-called
information appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the PC continuing to be the center of the computing
solar system, they say, the network will become the universe.
Information appliances, the post-PC proponents explain, can be
thought of as personal communicators _ devices that mainly send and
obtain information to and from the network, instead of creating and
manipulating information the way personal computers do.
</P>
<P>
   The forerunners are digital cell phones, like the Nokia 6160 and
the Qualcomm PDQ, and hand-held devices, like the Palm Pilot and
the Motorola Pagewriter.
</P>
<P>
   And if these diverse digital gadgets are an indication, the
information appliance market will likely resemble the consumer
electronics business, with a flood of different products in every
shape and description, a chaotic grab-bag of wacky failures and
well-designed winners _ a world apart from the beige-box monotony
of the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The post-PC enthusiasts see a future when everything from a
household's car to its coffee maker has its own embedded
microchips, ready to receive remote instruction. From work, a
person could tap into the Internet to, say, program the video
cassette recorder, defrost food and leave a message for a family
member.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the beginning of a new age where we will have an
explosion of embedded and personal devices,'' said William Joy, a
founder and vice president of research of Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Horn, a senior vice president for research at IBM Corp., is
another adherent to post-PC doctrine. ``The trend is pretty clear
toward a proliferation of different computing devices at the
individual level being fed specialized information from powerful
networks,'' Horn said. ``Instead of millions of personal computers,
you have billions of devices eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of such thinking _ most notably Microsoft and
Intel _ deride the post-PC concept as an amalgam of half-truths
expounded by the losers in the PC revolution. The personal
computer, the industry incumbents concede, must become smaller,
cheaper and easier to use. There is a shift under way, they agree,
toward more of the technology and software development being
focused not on the desktop but on network hub, or server,
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all of that, they argue, can and will be embraced by the
evolving personal computer industry, which has the capacity to
expand both upward to take over industrial-strength corporate
computing chores once handled by mainframe computers, and downward
into the market for hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the post-PC era,'' said Craig Mundie, a senior vice
president for consumer strategy of Microsoft. ``We're entering the
PC-plus era.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there will be a place for non-PC appliances, Mundie allows,
but they will be ``complementary to the evolving personal
computer'' _ anchored to the PC, not divorced from it.
</P>
<P>
   What the post-PC revolutionaries underestimate, the PC
incumbents say, is the pull of the 250 million people who now use
personal computers and who represent the infrastructure of modern
computing. Without the personal computer, they say, the Internet
would still be 20,000 academics sending e-mail to each other from
Unix workstations. And they contend that even the star among early
information appliances, the Palm Pilot, owes its popularity largely
to its ability to swap information with the personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have hundreds of millions of users, change is
evolutionary,'' said Grove of Intel. ``Computers will become
smaller, cheaper and more mobile. But they will be mostly
full-function personal computers because people are going to want
their same data in a form they are familiar with for years and
years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Exponents of post-PC computing disagree. ``The new era will
escape the dependency on the PC,'' said Donna Dubinsky, a
co-founder of Palm Computing, creator of the Palm Pilot, which is
now part of 3Com Corp.
</P>
<P>
   She has moved on to found a new company, Handspring Inc., that
hopes to help usher in what she calls ``an era of ubiquitous
hand-held computing.'' There is no way, Ms. Dubinsky insists, to
bring the next generation of hand-held devices below $100 in price
without ``disconnecting from the PC'' and making them ``an
extension of the network, not the desktop.''
</P>
<P>
   No one argues that the personal computer will go away. Indeed,
personal computer shipments worldwide will rise nearly 13 percent
annually though 2002, estimates International Data Corp., a
research firm. What the post-PC faithful foresee, though, is a
shift away from the personal computer as the dominant computing
technology. And they can point to projections from International
Data that by 2005 more information appliances linked to the
Internet _ including set-top boxes, screen phones and hand-held
computers _ will be sold than personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The history of the mainframe industry, analysts say, is
instructive. These big workhorse computers crunch more data than
ever before. But for all intents, the mainframe era ended when the
personal computer moved into the mainstream, with the introduction
of the IBM PC in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Investment and software development focused elsewhere. And the
profit margins on mainframes _ after nearly two decades of pressure
from the economics of the microprocessor and the personal computer
_ are a fraction of what they once were.
</P>
<P>
   Information appliances, notes Steven Milunovich, a managing
director of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., represent a break in the evolution
of the computer industry because they are specialized devices _
designed to perform one or two tasks well _ instead of the
general-purpose computers that both mainframes and personal
computers have been.
</P>
<P>
   All of these new appliances will have digital technology in
common, but they will be tailored for dozens and dozens of
special-purpose niche markets, catering to different needs and
users. It will be a more diverse business, far less susceptible to
being dominated by a few leading technology vendors, as Microsoft
and Intel rule the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging information-appliance industry has attracted the
consumer-electronics giants. Sony Corp., for example, is working to
develop a new class of devices, adapted for what Mario Tokoro, head
of the company's Information Technology Laboratories, calls the
coming era of ``intimate computing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC was created in the image of the monolithic mainframe of
long ago,'' Tokoro, who is a computer scientist, said. In contrast,
Sony expects the information appliance market to produce the
Internet's answer to its ``Walkman'' products _ an opportunity for
innovative new devices not available in the mature personal
computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   According to the post-PC doctrine, the obstacle that prevents
personal computers from being used by more than some 40 percent of
American households is not their cost, which keeps dropping, but
their complexity. One of the intellectual leaders of the post-PC
movement is Donald Norman, a former researcher at Apple Computer
and Hewlett-Packard, whose new book ``The Invisible Computer''
proclaims, ``The Achilles heel of the modern PC is its
difficulty.''
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer, Norman says, is the Swiss Army knife of
modern technology. ``While it can fill an amazing variety of needs,
it isn't particularly good at any one of them,'' he writes. The
author's conclusion: ``Information appliances are the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online Inc. believes that information appliances are
part of the answer to bringing the 75 percent of American
households not yet linked to the Internet into the online
community. An information-appliance program is an important element
in the long-range strategy behind America Online's $4.2 billion
purchase last month of Netscape Communications Corp. _ a deal that
includes an alliance with Sun Microsystems, whose Java Internet
programming language and Jini technology will be used to feed data
to these simple devices.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the deal was announced, Marc Andreessen, a
co-founder of Netscape, delivered a 12-page memo to Stephen Case,
chairman of America Online, sketching his view of the technological
opportunities for the combined company to extend its reach in the
Internet and in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Internet appliances are clearly part of the plan, enabling
America Online subscribers to get their e-mail and do online
shopping through simple hand-held devices, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online has a big opportunity to drive the acceptance
of these devices,'' Andreessen said. ``It's a consumer company and
for these devices to be successful, you have to work backward from
consumer behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   At IBM, the strategy is to become the technology plumber for
post-PC computing. The company has decided to leave the appliances
to others, but it plans to supply components for them, from
specialized semiconductor chips that use very little electrical
power to tiny disk drives. IBM is also working on specialized hub
computers, or servers, that have the software needed to act as a
translator for users. These servers could field a request for
information from a consumer and then render it in the form
appropriate for that user _ whether sent to a pager, cell phone,
hand-held device, set-top box or personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Within IBM, the post-PC world is called ``pervasive computing.''
After a yearlong internal study, IBM has set up a pervasive
computing unit to make sure the company's various businesses are
attuned to this emerging market. ``We concluded this is going to be
a big deal and it's going to change the industry,'' said Mark
Bregman, general manager for the pervasive computing unit.
</P>
<P>
   IBM believes change can come without rapid arrival of high-speed
data networks that can deliver movie-quality video and audio to
information appliances anywhere _ the obstacle that opponents of
the post-PC concept say will forestall any major changes. Bregman
says the near-term benefits will be conveniences like calling an
800-number while on vacation and leaving voice-mail instructions so
that several specific e-mail messages you are expecting will be
forwarded to you for reading on the display screen of your cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital investment is beginning to focus on the enabling
technologies of the post-PC era, including new chips for
information appliances, new screen-display technology, and optical
networking, which promises to vastly increase the capacity and
speed of communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   The investment and excitement about post-PC computing has some
of the feel of the early 1980s, when the personal computer industry
was starting to take off, observed Richard Shaffer, principal of
Technologic Partners, a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Shaffer says, the personal computer industry is a mature
business. Winning in that business, he explains, is mainly about
marketing, manufacturing efficiency and inventory management _ with
the success of Dell Computer Corp. as the exemplary case.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We're going back to an era when technology can
really make a business difference again.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although novelists have written plays, and playwrights have
written novels, it is rare for a writer to be equally adept at both
arts, with one definite exception being Samuel Beckett. But at 43,
Beckett's countryman Sebastian Barry seems well on his way to such
an accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Steward of Christendom'' (presented last year at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music) is a harrowing drama about the
redemption of Dublin's last police chief before Irish independence.
Barry's 1998 play, ``Our Lady of Sligo,'' acclaimed at the Royal
National Theater in London and at the Abbey Theater in Dublin, is
his darkest, most mordant work.
</P>
<P>
   With his second and latest novel, ``The Whereabouts of Eneas
McNulty,'' Barry shows a command of the narrative form and the
lyrical sweep of his poetic Irish predecessors. Eneas is the latest
in Barry's empathetic gallery of exiles, a peaceful man who is
treated as a pariah in his community. Through the life of his title
character, the author depicts the cruel paradoxes in 20th-century
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Barry is part of a wave of talented and remarkably prolific new
Irish playwrights that includes Martin McDonagh, Billy Roche and
Conor McPherson. ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' is the first in
McDonagh's ``Connemara Trilogy'' about working-class people in
provincial Ireland. Roche, whose work has not yet been seen on the
New York stage, wrote ``The Wexford Trilogy,'' dealing with the
grittiness of day-to-day life in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   McPherson has moved from the boy's-night-out world of ``This
Lime Tree Bower'' to spectral tales like ``St. Nicholas'' (a
one-man play acted off-Broadway last season by Brian Cox) and ``The
Weir,'' scheduled for Broadway this season. These four writers and
others, including Marina Carr, are in the great Irish tradition,
from O'Casey and Synge through Beckett and on to Brian Friel.
</P>
<P>
   Barry's plays and his novel are inspired by moments in the lives
of the author's relatives, who have been neglected by history and
forgotten by their own family. Through his art, he reinvents them
as dramatic characters.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, he explored his motivation for writing
what he calls ghost plays: ``If some of the people in your family
have been erased _ for religious reasons or for what they have done
_ that means that part of yourself has been erased.'' His search is
for the metaphorical DNA that links him with his ancestors. Through
Barry's work, theatergoers and readers can track the genealogy of
his family of characters, as well as the course of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The title character in his new novel, based on his great-uncle,
is an Irishman without a country. Unable to find work in Ireland
before World War I, he becomes a British merchant seaman. Later he
joins the Royal Irish Constabulary. Although he is regarded as a
traitor to the cause of Irish independence, he is a hero who
stoically follows his heart, placing morality above patriotism. In
a reading of his work at New York University's Ireland House, Barry
chose a pivotal section in which Eneas is threatened by a childhood
friend who demands that he leave Ireland or face assassination.
Like his Virgilian namesake, Eneas becomes a wanderer.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about his great-uncle, an outcast like Eneas, he said,
``I was trying to restore him in the book of life, and, ironically,
the only way I could do that was to invent a life for him.'' His
fictionalization is, he said, ``a lie of a life, but it's the only
life I can give back to this man.'' Descriptive details differ, but
the essence remains, the tragic story of a man _ fact and fiction _
trapped by his own and his nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly ``The Steward of Christendom'' was inspired by the
life of his great-grandfather, a police chief who was demonized by
his neighbors as an agent of the British. The title character in
``Our Lady of Sligo'' is his grandmother, Mai O'Hara, who, along
with her husband, waged a private war against the injustices of
Irish nationalism. ``A fearsome and dangerous creature,'' Mai died
two years before her grandson was born. ``I can't say that the play
presents her as a wonderful role model,'' he said, ``but it does
give her a place in the world. That pleases me, to have done that
strange service for my grandmother.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Eneas McNulty'' started out as a play. Unable to complete it
to his satisfaction, he put it aside. The problem with making it a
play, he said, was that Eneas was not a reflective man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confusion, as Friel said, is not an ignoble condition, but
Eneas is perpetually confused. That didn't seem to work in a
play,'' Barry said. ``It's like forcing a person to speak when he
has no intention of speaking.'' When he picked it up again, it
seemed to fit naturally into the novelistic form.
</P>
<P>
   In the manner of George Bernard Shaw, who grouped his work into
Plays Pleasant and Plays Unpleasant, Barry set out to write seven
Plays Familial. But he wrote only six. For him ``Eneas McNulty''
completes the cycle. Now he is thinking about writing what he
refers to as a public play, dealing more directly with events in
contemporary Irish history.
</P>
<P>
   Barry traces his interest in theater to his childhood. His
mother, Joan O'Hara, is a leading actress with the Abbey Theater;
his father was an architect who had written poetry as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy of 7 he was taken to the theater to see his mother
work. After leaving her in her dressing room, he was led to his
seat in the audience. As he spoke about the momentous day, he
seemed to project himself back in time as he watched his mother in
Yeats' ``Cathleen ni Hoolihan'': ``I can see the stage very black,
and this old, old woman walks toward me and starts to speak, `I am
Cathleen, the daughter Hoolihan.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He knew that the actress was his mother but he remembers
thinking, ``How would I be able to go home with this old, old
woman?'' It did not occur to him that there was a difference
between his mother offstage and in character. He is still perplexed
by the magic of the acting process. ``In a way, I still haven't
sorted that out. The difference now is that I don't want to sort it
out.'' He said he was less influenced by writers than by ``that
vanished company of Abbey actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, as an observer of his own work, he marvels how
Donal McCann in ``The Steward of Christendom,'' Sinead Cusack in
``Our Lady of Sligo'' and others transform themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Although he often went to the Abbey as a young man, for years he
avoided working in the theater because he considered it his
mother's world. While studying Latin at Trinity College in Dublin,
he wrote fiction and poetry. Discouraged by life in Ireland and by
what he thought was a pervasive air of corruption, he moved to the
Continent, spending most of his time in Paris, where he wrote for
the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Dublin, he met the actress who was to become
his wife. After she left for a few weeks to work in a series for
the BBC, he decided to write a play, in emulation of Garcia Lorca,
who was said to have written one in two weeks. The result,
completed quickly, was ``Boss Grady's Boys.'' His wife, Alison,
read it and suggested he send it to the Abbey, which presented it
in 1988 in a production starring Eamon Kelly, who was so pleased
with the work that he wrote on a poster, ``Well done, Sebastian.
You turned Dublin's head.''
</P>
<P>
   With his first play, Barry found the theater to be ``entirely
addictive.'' Looking back, he admitted an earlier resistance. ``In
the arrogance of my youth, I had considered playwriting to be not
quite as admirable as poetry or even fiction,'' he said. ``Now it
seems to me the strength of a play is that it exists very clearly
on that little stage in the back of your mind, and then it exists
when it's produced.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother has acted in several of his plays. She inspired the
character of the daughter in ``Our Lady of Sligo.'' In that play,
her mother describes her as ``this child of mine, going off in the
morning to dance about in next to nothing I suppose in foreign
plays, written by fellas with hard little bitter names, Gorky and
the like.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he believes that politics are changing in Ireland,
opening the country to new freedoms, Barry sees a greater
expansiveness among Irish writers, especially in the theater. ``The
real sea change is that you don't feel that spirit being diminished
in your own country,'' he said. ``Maybe that's what's given rise to
this fountain of plays. It's like a stain being taken off a
picture. Strange birds can fly unmolested now in Irish writing.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' continuing on Broadway and
``The Weir'' forthcoming, Barry said, only half jokingly, that
``Our Lady of Sligo'' would probably not be done in New York until
next season because ``there is room only for one Irish play a year
on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he has been immersing himself in another theatrical
form, collaborating with Martha Clarke on a projected Broadway
version of the Frank Loesser movie musical ``Hans Christian
Andersen.'' For the show, he is creating a new book, the opposite
of the fanciful Danny Kaye film, and, it would seem, a new and more
authentic persona for Andersen, one with an antipathy to children.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there were any way one of his relatives could be worked
into the musical, he said, ``I have a terrible feeling that in the
end it will be a version of my Great-Uncle Harry. I'm not sure I
can work any other way.'' Then, in what could be a description of
his creative process, he said, ``It's just the harvesting of things
you accidentally know.''

SELECTIVE FRENCH HOMAGE TO JEWISH HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN RIDING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In a country already crowded with museums dedicated to
every imaginable topic, it was at the very least strange that until
now France had no Jewish museum worthy of the name. After all, more
Jews live in France than any other European country except Russia.
France also has an outstanding moral debt to a Jewish population
decimated by wartime deportations from occupied France to Nazi
death camps.
</P>
<P>
   This month, France finally made amends when President Jacques
Chirac inaugurated the new Museum of the Art and History of Judaism
in the Marais, the old Jewish quarter of Paris. Chirac's presence
was not just a formality. As the first French president to
apologize for the pro-Nazi Vichy regime's role in persecuting Jews
during World War II, he was all too aware of the important
symbolism of the occasion. He had also helped make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1980, as mayor of Paris, he backed the project, and
six years later he designated a 17th-century mansion owned by the
city to be transformed into the museum. Subsequently, the $40
million cost of restoring and expanding the Hotel de Saint-Aignan
was shared by the national and city governments. Each will also
contribute $2 million annually toward the operating costs of what
is now, no less than the Louvre, a national museum. With the
general public in mind, the museum aims to provide an overview of
the history of European Jews since the Middle Ages, with sections
dedicated to the parallel development of the Ashkenazic and
Sephardic cultures, respectively in Northern and Eastern Europe and
in Spain and North Africa. It also dwells on the emancipation of
Jews initiated by the French Revolution and the emergence of
nonreligious Jewish art this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm incredibly impressed with the quality of the objects they
have put together,'' Norman Kleeblatt, the Susan and Elihu Rose
curator of fine arts at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan, said after
visiting the new museum. ``I had been afraid that the objects might
be swallowed up by the architecture. They were not. The quality and
beauty of the objects is impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the celebration of the new museum at 71 Rue du
Temple in the Fourth Arrondissement, the very choice of its name
underlines the continuing complexity of the relationship between
France and its Jewish population. In other words, the Museum of the
Art and History of Judaism is not a museum of the history of Jews
in France. More specifically, the fate of France's Jews in World
War II, when 78,000 were deported, and after which only some 2,000
returned, is barely addressed.
</P>
<P>
   This omission provoked a fiercely critical article in the
left-leaning daily Liberation. It also prompted expressions of
surprise from some experts. ``I think that even a Jewish public
expected that the fate of their French brethren be mentioned more
explicitly in the museum,'' said Edward van Voolen, curator of the
Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   The only direct reference to the Holocaust is found in an
installation by Christian Boltanski that includes a wall peppered
with plaques that carry the names, birthplaces and professions of
Jews who lived in the Hotel de Saint-Aignan in the late 1930s. At
least 13 of these residents were arrested and sent to death camps
during the German occupation of Paris between May 1940 and August
1944.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the decision not to focus on the Holocaust is not
accidental. It reflects the continuing reluctance of France as a
whole and French Jews to confront this painful past, even though
the subject is no longer ignored as it was for many decades. But it
also touches on a broader debate over how far the Holocaust should
be treated as a central event of Judaism and whether it should be
commemorated in Jewish museums or through separate Holocaust
memorials.
</P>
<P>
   ``How prevalent is the Holocaust in Jewish history?'' Kleeblatt
asked. ``It's a real issue, and we struggle with that in the Jewish
Museum. Does a Jewish museum only become a museum of tragedy? A
Jewish museum also has an obligation to tell a cultural story.''
</P>
<P>
   These questions have become all the more topical as new Jewish
museums have sprung up across Europe in recent years, among them
those of Amsterdam in 1986, Frankfurt in 1988, Vienna in 1994 and
London and the former East Berlin in 1995. A new extension to the
Berlin Historical Museum, which will record the history of Jews in
Berlin and is also already known as the Jewish Museum, opens next
year. In Berlin and Vienna, though, separate Holocaust memorials
are planned.
</P>
<P>
   The point of departure in Paris was different. Here, the
museum's profile was initially defined by the availability of two
existing collections: 149 religious objects and ancient manuscripts
collected by Isaac Strauss in the early 19th century and donated to
the Musee National du Moyen Age in 1890, and the contents of a
small Jewish Art Museum founded in 1948 by Jewish groups trying to
rescue remnants of Jewish culture after the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 12 years, the new museum has been building on these
collections through donations, purchases and loans, albeit always
maintaining the focus on the art and history of Judaism, as with
its rooms dealing with the presence of Jews in the Italian
Renaissance and Jews in 17th-century Amsterdam and an exhibit on
the Dreyfus Affair, the late- 19th-century scandal over a French
Jewish army officer unjustly accused of treason.
</P>
<P>
   While the museum's organizers leave open the question whether
Jewish art exists as such, they have brought together works by a
number of Jewish painters, many of whom moved to France early in
this century and belonged to the so-called Ecole de Paris. One
entire room is also dedicated to paintings and drawings by Marc
Chagall, on loan from the Georges Pompidou Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Pompidou Center has further loaned 25 paintings, looted by
Nazi occupiers and recovered after the war, whose owners, presumed
to be Jewish collectors, have not yet been identified. These
include works by Picasso, Dufy, Leger, Matisse and Utrillo, and
they are among some 2,000 art objects still held by the French
government pending identity of the rightful heirs.
</P>
<P>
   This loan is evidently a political nod to the current heated
debate in Europe and the United States over the whereabouts and
ownership of valuable works of art seized by the Germans from
Jewish collectors. Otherwise, however, the museum takes little
account of changing French attitudes towards the Holocaust over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1988, the Jewish question and Jewish culture were being
studied in France for the first time,'' Laurence Sigal, the
museum's director, recalled. ``The Shoah still had a very small
place in the Jewish and French conscience. It was still a private
question; now it is a national problem.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When the museum was being planned, Ms. Sigal went on, a more
pressing issue related to reinforcing the identity of a French
Jewish population that is anything but homogeneous. Ashkenazic Jews
belong to centuries-old families that are fully integrated into
French life but are also descendants of more recent immigrants
whose families have been in France for two or three generations.
Further, some 350,000 Sephardic Jews, perhaps half of all French
Jews, migrated to France from North Africa in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, there was nowhere in France where you could see
Jewish heritage,'' Ms. Sigal said. ``There was no public space
where Jewish art and culture could be confronted, only synagogues,
which were religious and private.''
</P>
<P>
   While many objects on display are religious, from ancient Torah
scrolls to silver Hanukkah menorahs, they are presented as art,
since by law the French government cannot finance religious
institutions. Further, given France's ``melting pot'' tradition, no
thought was given to using the museum to promote a separate Jewish
political identity.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as public awareness has grown of France's shared
responsibility for the deportation of Jews in World War II, the
Jewish question has become intensely political here. And in that
sense the minimal attention given to the history of Jews in France,
from their expulsion in 1394 and their deportation in the early
1940s, can hardly go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Van Voolen, the curator in Amsterdam, said that, thanks to the
Paris museum, ``Jewish culture has come out of the closet in the
most grandiose French way.'' But he also saw the museum as
presenting Jewish art more clearly than Jewish history, certainly
as it relates to France and the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Boltanski piece is sufficient,'' he said.
``I think it is a negative reflection on the self-confidence of
French Jews that the museum does not address what is so hotly
discussed outside the walls of the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sigal said that homage was paid to the Holocaust ``by
showing everything that has disappeared.'' She noted that the
Holocaust was specifically remembered in a Memorial to the Unknown
Jewish Martyr, which was inaugurated in Paris in 1956 in another
building in the Marais that also houses the prestigious Center of
Contemporary Jewish Documentation. In addition, a monument to the
deportation stands on the Pont de la Tourelle, across the Seine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the museum does have room for temporary exhibitions that
can tackle more topical issues. ``This is a new museum, and they
need time to reflect and grow,'' Kleeblatt said in a telephone
interview. ``It's a natural process. You can't expect a museum to
arrive fully formed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sigal readily shared this view. ``We have only just opened
the museum,'' she said. ``Its image will grow with time.''

   Monday will be cloudy from the central Gulf of Mexico coast to
the Northeast. A bit of rain will brush the New England coast.
Meanwhile, a flow of moist air from the southeast will promote
heavier showers near low pressure as it moves over Alabama and
Georgia. Farther north, patchy light rain will develop near the
southern Appalachians, which may begin as freezing rain in some
higher elevations.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly dry and tranquil weather will prevail from the southern
Great Lakes to the southern Plains. Farther north, clouds and areas
of light snow will occur near a front marking the boundary between
relative mild air and the Arctic air covering most of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   As low pressure develops along the front, strong winds will
buffet the slopes of the northern and central Rockies. Periods of
snow will be common along west-facing slopes where moist winds
ascend the terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Brisk onshore winds will keep the Northwest unsettled with
coastal rain and mountain snow. The Southwest will stay mild and
dry.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: ICY ADVISORIES
</P>
<P>
   This winter, the National Weather Service in Little Rock, Ark.,
will begin issuing advisories for a phenomenon called freezing fog,
which can lead to slick roadways. Usually, the tiny water droplets
from fog or drizzle freeze without rupturing. A white hue can be
seen on roads as the air trapped within the droplets leads to a
visible coating of ice called rime. Sometimes an invisible icing
occurs when the droplets rupture and freeze upon striking the cold
ground. A translucent glaze known as black ice then clings to the
road for the unsuspecting driver to encounter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Had a celebrant dozed off last New Year's Eve and not come to
until now, he might woozily take a look at the Internet business
and conclude that it had been an uneventful year.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the leading online service is still America Online,
the most popular site on the World Wide Web is still Yahoo, and
people are still transacting the most electronic commerce through
Amazon.com. All these companies are growing briskly, as online use
increases, just as they were a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But what if our Net van Winkle were to groggily dispatch a
series of e-mails to Internet investors and financiers, asking what
he had missed? At first, of course, he might be flamed by those
incredulous that anyone could sleep through all that ruckus.
Internet stocks soared early this year before stalling and then
plunging in a terrifying free fall in October, only to pull out and
zoom even higher than before. Meanwhile, initial public offerings
by Internet companies were exploding into the firmament like
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   For all the bombast, though, a look back at the year's events
indicate that our sleepy celebrant's initial observation might be
fairly accurate. In the Internet business, the forces propelling
the leading companies like America Online, Yahoo and Amazon.com
remained the same _ even if the pace picked up faster than anyone
might have expected. And yet the tumultuous year does seem to yield
at least five lessons about the Internet industry and the stocks
associated with it:
</P>
<P>
   _ The big get bigger and the small fade away.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the Internet seems to favor David over Goliath,
as any upstart can open an online store or an electronic
publication. But it appears that the first capable pipsqueak to
shoot a slingshot in any given area may grow to giant size so
quickly than any new challengers have been kept at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some very powerful franchises have been built on the Internet
in an incredibly short time,'' said Fred Wilson, a principal with
Flatiron Partners, a New York venture capital firm. ``Some of these
companies will be the leaders of the economy in the next
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The best example is Amazon.com, which continues to widen the gap
between itself and its better-known book-selling competitor, Barnes
&AMP; Noble. And in the year's third quarter, Amazon.com's first full
quarter selling compact disks, it became the country's leading
online music retailer. (It's not an accident that the two other
leading music stores, CD Now and N2K, have chosen to merge in order
to attempt a new assault on the emerging Amazon.com giant.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a successful Internet company is not as easy is it might
appear,'' said Derek brown, an analyst with the investment bank of
Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   _ When investors spot a category leader, there is no limit to
what they will pay to own the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The main lesson of 1998, said Keith Benjamin, an analyst with
BancBoston Robertson Stephens, is ``just don't fight the tape.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fruitless, Benjamin has concluded, to try to find rational
explanations for the astronomical Internet stock prices sliding
across the ticker. The fact that, in the stock market, America
Online is worth almost as much as Walt Disney and that Yahoo is
more valuable than CBS is simply not relevant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market opportunity here is big enough that that is what we
should be focused on for any given segment,'' he said, ``and
competitive position is the most critical factor in judging these
stocks''
</P>
<P>
   Such judgment, of course, involves far more forethought than
many investors may be applying. Yet, while much of the upward
pricing pressure has come from individual investors, increasingly
the big boys have started to compete for the relatively small
number of shares in circulation for the leading Internet companies,
which has pushed prices every higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Institutional portfolio managers learned to `embrace' Internet
stocks in the second half, for a simple reason,'' said David
Readerman, an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ``The
stocks were going up, and their relative performance suffered by
not owning enough of them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Everybody wants to be an Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the frenzy if someone introduced the anti-gravity diet,
where no matter how much you ate, the scale would still register
you as weightless.
</P>
<P>
   That is the equivalent of what the stock market has offered to
Internet companies, which are not penalized for gluttonous spending
far in excess of their meager incomes. So it's no surprise that all
sorts of other companies, weary of weighing in every quarter with
the traditional measure of profits or losses, would want to belly
up to this brave new training table.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the lighter-than-air feat of K-Tel International's
stock, when the company _ best known for hawking music compilations
late at night on UHF television stations _ announced it was moving
onto the Web. K-Tel's stock quadrupled in two weeks, and even now
is up 80 percent from its pre-Web days, closing last Thursday at
$12.5625.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is in love with the Internet and believes that
Internet stocks are the way to play the future,'' Wilson said.
``But the public is not particularly adept at picking the good ones
from the bad ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Even old-fashioned companies like Fingerhut, the catalog
merchant, have hired publicists to convince investors that their
various Web sites qualifies their stocks for Internet-style
valuations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Investors are very selective in accepting initial public stock
offerings (except when they'll buy anything.com).
</P>
<P>
   After the sharp drop in Internet stocks at the end of the
summer, when most companies gave up much of their gains for the
year, there was nearly a month when no initial public offerings
were bought to the market. Finger-wagging financiers warned that it
would be very difficult for any but the very best Internet
companies to go public.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then the market devoured offerings from Broadcast.com, the
leading Internet audio service, and Ebay, the leading Internet flea
market. And suddenly, all sorts of companies were going public that
were hardly leaders in anything. One such offering was for
Theglobe.com, an online chat service that has many fewer users than
many of its competitors, but still saw its shares jump from $9 to
$97 on the first day of trading in October. It now lingers at $38.
</P>
<P>
   One sign that the death of outrage, much noted in Washington, is
equally applicable on Wall Street is that Zapata, a fish oil
processor, has just resurrected its much-ridiculed plan to
transform itself into an Internet service under the name Zap.Com.
Zapata's shares nearly doubled in price last Wednesday, when the
company issued a press release announcing its comeback. The shares
closed last Thursday at $12.375, down $1.875.
</P>
<P>
   _ The power is in the portals.
</P>
<P>
   Reading his e-mail, Net van Winkle wouldn't know what people
meant when they wrote of ``portals.'' A year ago, services like
Yahoo and Excite were known as search engines, although they had
already started to offer other portal services like news and
shopping guides, in order to keep their vast audience on their
sites longer.
</P>
<P>
   This past year, these companies and others doing business as
portal sites, along with America Online, were the main
beneficiaries of all the money that was pumped into Internet public
offerings. How come? Because all of the emerging commerce sites,
like Ebay, and online communities, like Geocities, spent millions
of dollars to buy advertising and other promotions on the popular
portal sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the Tom Sawyer phenomenon, where all of the
neighborhood kids paid Tom Sawyer in order to paint the fence for
him,'' said Michael Parekh, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
``One-third to one-half of the money raised by Internet IPOs,'' he
said, ``was immediately given to the portals.''
</P>
<P>
   So what about next year? Would these lessons become all the more
evident after another 52-week nap?
</P>
<P>
   They could. But then again, 1999 might be the year when even
some of the Internet giants are toppled. Maybe Walt Disney's new Go
network will steal some of the the thunder of Yahoo. Or the upstart
Buy.Com, which sells books and computer products at a loss in order
to make money on advertising, could surge past Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Congress will figure out how to impose sales taxes on
Internet purchases, slowing the growth of electronic retailing.
With expectations and many Internet stock prices at such giddy
heights, it might not take much of a disappointment to set off a
major, negative mood swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valuation is the risk in 1999,'' Readerman, the analyst, said.
``When the stocks stop performing, the herd who rushed in could
just as easily reverse course, as everyone tries to get out
first.''
</P>
<P>
   And that kind of a crash could be a little harder to sleep
through.

 By PETER APPLEBOME    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The crowd does not roar. It screams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you say you're not going to scream, but then you
do,'' said Karen Lopez, a 14-year-old from Queens, as she angled
for a glimpse of a wayward elbow, a Fubu jacket or anything else
signifying the presence of the group 'N Sync, which was at that
very moment gracing the MTV studios one story above her in Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it; it's like it's something automatic,'' she
continued, an eye cocked attentively skyward during the group's
recent appearance. ``You're there, and then you start screaming,
and then you scream some more. Your head hurts when you're
finished, but you don't notice it while you're out here doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   So it goes at the MTV studios on Broadway where young fans, most
of them teen-age girls, regularly line the streets of Times Square
hoping to glimpse the acts that show up for MTV's ``Total Request
Live,'' seen on weekdays at 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On the days when the groups are special favorites of the
early-teen set, particularly the current trinity of the Backstreet
Boys, 'N Sync or Hanson, they spend hours exercising their lungs in
a high-pitched cacophony that sounds from a distance like the wind
whipping through the urban canyons, and up close like a mass
audition for a hormonal horror movie.
</P>
<P>
   Even from a distance, it can be painful, the sound ebbing and
spiking for hours. But up close, the key apparently is to be so of
the moment that noise and quiet blend into a blissed-out moment of
pop zen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're screaming, you don't hear it,'' said Lauren
Licciardi, a 14-year-old from Queens, who showed up for an
appearance by Hanson last month. ``When you don't scream, it's so
loud it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Others find noise management more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Hanson, but right now I have the biggest headache in
the world,'' said Catherine Rodriguez of Cuddebackville.
</P>
<P>
   The rapturous hysterics of teen-age girls have a long and proud
history, of course, going back to the bobby-soxers who swooned and
screamed for Frank Sinatra and cresting with the Beatles fans
kicking their feet, pounding their faces and screaming their brains
out in the early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, screamworthy teen-age idols have come and gone, from
Leif Garrett to David Cassidy to Andy Gibb. But there has never
been a single place that served as a continuing focus for the
histrionics.
</P>
<P>
   Enter MTV. In September 1997 the music channel moved its studio
from a private site on 57th Street to a concourse-level,
20,000-square-foot fish bowl that stretches across a full block on
Broadway between 44th and 45th streets. Fans soon began showing up
for live interview shows, and the pilgrimage of the faithful to
Times Square almost immediately became a part of the fan
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Different acts get different crowds, like the metal fans who
lumber out in skull-and-crossbones T-shirts to greet Metallica or
the more diverse crowds that turn out for Janet Jackson or Jewel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all make their own noise,'' said Van Toffler, MTV's
general manager. ``You might get more of a grumbling kind of noise
for Metallica or Motley Crue, instead of the screaming you get for
the Backstreet Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the screamers tend to be teen-age girls from the New
York metropolitan region, like Michelle Greenberg from East Meadow,
who showed up for the Hanson appearance with her friend Ilana
Zuckerman and her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an obligation,'' Ms. Greenberg said solemnly between
shrieks, like a Republican congressman weighing the gravity of
impeachment. ``You have to do it. The screaming just hypes you up
even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Neil Greenberg, who describes his daughter's room as
``a Hanson shrine,'' took a paternal and historical view of the
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than kids doing drugs,'' he said. ``Kids are
always going to find something to be crazy about, so why not this?
I was there when the Beatles played Shea Stadium, and they screamed
a lot louder than this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Others come from farther away.
</P>
<P>
   When 'N Sync appeared, Karen La Plante skipped a day of finals
at her high school in Westfield, Mass., and took the train to New
York with her friend Heather Page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 18, so I'm not a teeny-bopper,'' she said. ``I don't know
what it is, but I just love 'N Sync. I've taken some pictures of
Joey's arm, his head, Lansten's arm. All you see is yellow and red
and blue, but it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the essential dynamics of teen-age fans have not
changed much since the days of the Beatles. The emotions and age
groups are about the same. The screams partake of the same youthful
mix of user-friendly music and rampaging early-adolescent hormones.
There are comparable competing armies with Backstreet Boys and 'N
Sync partisans like Beatles and Stones ones.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the remarkably consistent American cultural
tradition of sanitized white groups taking the form and content of
black music and delivering an unthreatening version of it to young
whites. 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys, in particular, have
reworked the sounds, styles, gestures and clothes of
rhythm-and-blues into a made-for-the-suburbs version.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, changes in technology and marketing have made
earlier eras seem prehistoric.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of scrounging for a few teen-age magazines or instant
books, fans now keep up with their favorites on dozens of Internet
sites like Jill's Backstreet Boys Heaven, the Kangarooland's Hanson
Web site or God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on 'N Sync. MTV
regularly announces which acts will be appearing, so fans are able
to mobilize when needed and scream whenever the cameras point their
way.
</P>
<P>
   And the commercial throw-weight of the teen-age industry makes
the old days seem comically small-time. Ana Agosto, 14, of South
Shelton, Conn., showed up for the 'N Sync appearance with her
mother, Evelyn, and her friend Rachel Nunes. She was wearing 'N
Sync's favored Fubu jacket and Nike Air Max sneakers and figured
she had spent about $3,000 over the last year or so on 'N Sync and
Backstreet Boys CDs, posters, pins, T-shirts, key chains,
refrigerator magnets, tour tags, books, calendars and other
essentials.
</P>
<P>
   The screaming is pretty much limited to the females, but a few
males turn up, more interested in the show outside than the one in
the studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here almost every day, but I came today because this
band, I know them; they're my friends,'' confided Angel Betances,
18, of Queens, as the girls around him shrieked for 'N Sync. ``I
met them back in September when they were on MTV. You wouldn't see
guys yelling the way these girls do. It must be the estrogen, I
think.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The promise of a crisp radio signal that can be heard anywhere
in the nation, considered a futuristic pipe dream a decade ago, now
appears to be only about a year from reality. Two companies with
government licenses to bring satellite-delivered digital broadcasts
to radio _ CD Radio Inc. and XM Satellite Inc. _ have lined up
technology and programming partners and plan to roll out their
services in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting a business model used by pay services like cable and
satellite television, both would-be satellite radio broadcasters
say they can build a business from fee-paying listeners who want
more than the standard AM or FM fare, or who hate to hear their
signal fade when they drive out of range.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional radio broadcasters, enjoying a record year in
advertising revenue, are skeptical that satellite services will
ever be serious competition to the free, over-the-air industry.
They tend to see audio programming over the Internet as the more
serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   But some on Wall Street seem to share the view of the trade
publication Radio Ink that satellite broadcasters will be ``the
Marconis of the millennium.'' The investors Sid Bass and Leon
Black, for instance, recently paid a total of $300 million for
separate stakes in CD Radio, a publicly held company that expects
to blanket the nation with signals from its three satellites by
early 2000, a few months ahead of its privately held rival, XM
Satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies say their prime targets will be ethnic audiences,
car commuters, long-haul truckers and listeners outside big cities
_ whom they hope are so dissatisfied with local stations that they
will pay $10 or so a month for national services with up to 100
channels.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners will need a satellite-radio adapter that will fit into
a cassette or CD player and a palm-sized antenna that will pick up
the signals. The receivers, expected to cost $300 or less, will
include digital displays showing the channel number, the format and
the title and performer of each piece of music.
</P>
<P>
   CD Radio's technology partners include Loral Space
Communications and Lucent Technologies, while XM's include the
Hughes Electronics unit of General Motors, STMicroelectronics,
Pioneer Electronic and Sharp. The groups hope eventually to
persuade automakers to offer satellite receivers as a standard
option for car-audio systems.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite players' ambitions are a marked contrast to the
technical conservatism of the conventional radio industry, which
has seen few innovations in the decades since the FM band was
updated to deliver stereo sound. Broadcasters, who lobbied against
satellite radio, are themselves reluctant to pursue digital audio
because of the expense and a perception that consumers are not
dissatisfied with the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not deterred the satellite radio companies from
proceeding with their plans. To obtain exclusive programs for
African-Americans, XM went to Black Entertainment Television and
Radio One Inc., a radio station owner that, like XM Satellite, is
based in Washington. And among its other dozens of channels of
music, news and talk, XM expects to broadcast the first national
Hindu and Mandarin Chinese radio programs.
</P>
<P>
   XM Satellite is owned by American Mobile Satellite Corp., which
provides wireless service to business, and World Space Inc., which
plans to offer satellite radio service outside the United States.
In March, XM made a deal to buy two satellites from Hughes and
expects to start broadcasting late in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   CD Radio, public since 1994, has made deals with the Hispanic
Radio Network, Sports Byline, Bloomberg Radio News and C-Span to
provide programming. Half of its 100 channels are to be
commercial-free music in formats that include jazz, opera and
reggae _ niches that would not survive on many local AM or FM
stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see broad-based appeal,'' said Bruce Leichtman, a media
research director for Yankee Group, a research firm hired by CD
Radio to study the service's potential market.
</P>
<P>
   CD Radio, which has tallied $63 million in losses since its
founding in 1990, has raised nearly all of the $960 million needed
for its start-up costs. Its shares, following the vicissitudes of a
technology start-up company, hit a 52-week high of $44 in May,
dipped below $15 in October and closed the week's trading last
Thursday at $34.875.
</P>
<P>
   Next November, the company expects to launch the first of its
three satellites, which along with a spare will cost $718 million.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An unresolved technical issue is the industry's development of a
receiver that can accept either CD Radio's or XM Satellite's
service, a requirement stipulated by the Federal Communications
Commission when it granted the two companies satellite licenses
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds are for the first generation, we won't get there,''
said David Margolese, chairman and co-founder of CD Radio, which is
building its studios in Rockefeller Center. ``Whether we hit it or
not, it's not that relevant,'' Margolese said, even though failure
to find a common receiver would require a regulatory waiver.
</P>
<P>
   CD Radio executives say the company can break even its first
year with 1 million subscribers. It is a daunting target for a
brand new-service, and one analyst cautioned that to stimulate
demand, satellite broadcasters would probably end up subsidizing
subscriber equipment, which could cut into potential profits.
</P>
<P>
   That is close to the situation playing out at DirecTV, a
satellite broadcaster owned by GM's Hughes Electronics unit that
has about 4.3 million subscribers, and has yet to break even after
four years in business. But ``CD Radio doesn't have anywhere near
the programming costs'' of DirecTV, Leichtman said.
</P>
<P>
   CD Radio intends to nearly match what DirecTV spent on
advertising in its first year, budgeting $60 million. That
marketing may be necessary to help CD Radio distinguish itself from
competitors. A third satellite radio rival has recently emerged:
WCS Radio Inc., a Menlo Park, Calif., consortium that holds
licenses for still-to-be-determined wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   In a hastily arranged FCC auction ordered by Congress in 1997, a
portion of the radio spectrum initially set aside for digital audio
service was redesignated for general purposes, in the expectation
that innovative uses would emerge. The 18 winning companies, which
include some of the regional Bell telephone companies, paid a total
of $13.5 million for the licenses. Now, after spending a year
trying to figure out a business plan, the WCS Radio 10-member
consortium has sought permission to offer digital audio services
similar to XM's and CD Radio's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is tremendous pent-up demand because there is
an appalling lack of formats,'' said John Mason, WCS' vice
president for business development. ``People want more selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Panero, XM's chief executive, contends that listeners are
underserved by the free programming offered on most ad-supported AM
and FM stations, which he derided as repetitive and formulaic. He
blamed deregulation, which has concentrated ownership of the
nation's stations into fewer hands, intent on using proven
money-making formats. ``Radio is risk averse,'' he said. ``We're
dedicated to bringing back what radio has lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for most XM channels to carry six minutes of
advertising an hour, about half the level heard on most stations.
Revenue is to be split equally with programming partners. Like CD
Radio, though, XM has not yet disclosed any list of confirmed
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Some conventional broadcasters question whether the satellite
companies will be able to lure advertisers, and point to the
services' reliance on expensive, unproven technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if these services are able to attain a substantial number
of subscribers, their actual listener base won't be anywhere near
the size of the audiences of the national radio networks,''
predicted David Kantor, president of AM FM Radio Networks, a unit
of Chancellor Broadcasting, one of the nation's largest station
owners. ``Advertisers are interested in measured audiences, not
number of subscribers.''

DIGITAL COMMERCE: TO TAX OR NOT TO TAX E-SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ga., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Even before the final sales numbers were tallied last week, it was
clear that online holiday sales would shoot well past all
expectations. And according to one recent study, the fact that
buyers could make their purchases without paying state or local
sales taxes or use taxes was a strong incentive for shopping on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Those who successfully pushed for passage in October of the
Internet Tax Freedom Act, which declared a three-year tax
moratorium for online sales, have reason to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term implications could be troubling. Although the
potential revenue is still too small to pose a serious problem in
the immediate future, what happens a few years down the pike, when
states see as much as one-third of their revenues circling the
drain?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, sales tax is the most important source of revenue
for states, so the moratorium is something they're clearly aware of
and worried about,'' said Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor
at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Goolsbee, who recently completed a study of the purchasing
habits of online consumers, said his research showed that the
number of online shoppers and the dollar amounts they spend would
drop by 25 percent and 30 percent respectively if they were charged
sales tax on their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hue and cry that taxing Internet sales is ``unfair''
to a budding new form of commerce, the Internet in fact only
intensifies a problem that has been brewing for decades in the
mail-order business.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, the legal issue is how to tax purchases that cross
state lines.
</P>
<P>
   A state's sales tax, per se, can only be collected when both
buyer and seller have a physical presence in the state _ meaning
that either there must be a face-to-face transaction or an
out-of-state seller must have an outlet somewhere in the state
where the buyer lives.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few decades ago, this arrangement worked fine. When
mail-order sales started to pick up steam, state governments
decided they had better impose a ``use'' tax on people who bought
items through catalogs (so called because they used their purchases
in the state). Although virtually no one pays such a tax and
virtually no state enforces it, consumers are supposed to
voluntarily pay the equivalent of sales tax on these out-of-state
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers cannot be required by states to collect these use taxes
from their customers, as they collect sales tax, because of
constitutional provisions banning the states from interfering with
interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Although catalog and Internet buyers benefit from this tangled
web, even legendary tax opponents like Arthur Laffer, the
supply-side guru of the Reagan administration, are concerned about
the implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of government is at risk here,'' Laffer said. ``Sales
tax funds virtually everything in the state,'' including police and
fire departments, welfare, roads, schools and mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probably the single best tax the state has, because it
has the broadest base and the lowest rate, to collect large sums of
money to fund government services,'' Laffer said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is something of a political football, says Walter
Hellerstein, a law professor at the University of Georgia who
specializes in the application of constitutional law to state
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that state governments derive at least a third
of their revenue and often more from sales tax, Hellerstein says,
neither the Supreme Court nor Congress wants to be responsible for
the havoc that would be created if the physical presence rule were
rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mail-order sellers, since before 1967, have made billions of
dollars in sales and have never collected use tax or filed a tax
return,'' he said. ``Because of that, the statute of limitations is
open'' and, theoretically, sellers could be required to pony up
huge sums of dollars in back taxes, a situation that would put most
of them out of business.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other economists are recommending even more radical action. The
Center for Community Economic Research at the University of
California, Berkeley, warned in a paper in August 1995 that ``state
and local government finances are becoming road kill on the
information superhighway.''
</P>
<P>
   In making its policy recommendations, the center noted that
commerce was increasingly conducted nationally and globally, rather
than locally. Thus, it said, state and local taxes should be scaled
back or even eliminated and replaced with a national tax that is
disbursed back to the states.
</P>
<P>
   Stating that ``study after study has shown the regressive nature
of sales tax as a revenue source,'' the paper said sales and use
taxes on mail-order (and, it would follow, Internet) purchases have
more impact on the poor, the disabled and the elderly than on
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to the advisory commission on electronic commerce that
was mandated by President Clinton, after the passage of the
Internet Tax Freedom Act, to come up with a solution to the
taxation problem.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which was to be made up of equal numbers of
industry and government representatives, is already being berated
by local government agencies like the National Association of
Counties for being lopsided in favor of industry, with powerhouse
companies on board including Time Warner Inc., Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co., Netscape Communications Corp. and MCI Worldcom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Government agencies are not the only ones incensed by the
composition of the commission. ``This does not pass the smell
test,'' said Charles McLure, a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institute at Stanford University and the economist who wrote the
basis for the Tax Reform Act of 1986. ``This is, `We're going to
build a fence around the chicken coop _ but let's not put any
chickens on it; let's put some wolves.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the commission's final composition may be, one hopes
its deliberations will be shaped by larger societal concerns and
not just the convenience or power of the fortunate few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks they have a constitutional right to buy tax
free when they buy mail order,'' Hellerstein said. ``At some point,
there's going to be revenue shortfall, and then I don't know what
will happen. Right now, everyone's flush and all they can think
about is some other way to cut taxes.''

HOLIDAY SHOPPERS UNAFFECTED BY IRAQ AND IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Largely undistracted by the impeachment of President Clinton and
the bombing of Iraq, U.S. shoppers appear to have spent freely from
wallets that still feel pretty fat, giving retailers a muscular, if
not stellar, holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Though industry figures will not be officially reported until
early January, retail analysts and merchants themselves are
predicting that December sales in big-chain stores open at least
one year will rise for the second year in a row by as much as 4
percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This year's holiday shopping reflected generally buoyant
consumer spending and an overall economic picture _ rebounding
stock prices, low inflation and a tight job market _ that remains
quite rosy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as consumers continue to get their daily fix from the
stock market, they will continue to spend,'' said Stephen Roach,
chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. ``Nothing will
stop them _ not impeachment, global turmoil or warm weather.''
</P>
<P>
   But they waited a while before rushing to the mall. Like Johnny
Mathis carols and reruns of ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' last-minute
and post-Yuletide shopping are becoming something of an American
Christmas tradition these days. In keeping with a trend of recent
years, a larger portion of holiday sales came in the week just
before Christmas and in the weekend right after.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, shoppers procrastinated until the last minute,
waiting for the biggest bargains,'' said Bruce Van Kleeck,
president of the National Retail Federation. This year, retailers
had to ``count on late shopping and after-holiday sales to be the
savior,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Department stores that cater to the middle price range felt the
squeeze as customers split their dollars between high-end and
low-end merchants. Sales at Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. and J.C. Penney
Co. were expected to be flat, and once final figures are in, the
entire sector is expected to show modest gains of just 1 percent to
2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone else, however, appears to have done relatively
well. Specialty apparel stores _ in particular Ann Taylor;
Victoria's Secret, which is a unit of Intimate Brands; and The Gap
chains, Banana Republic, Old Navy and The Gap itself _ sustained
their strong performance by appealing to consumers with distinctive
merchandise and effective ad campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   These stores even lifted sales at regional shopping malls, which
came up short of overall estimates last year, according to John
Konarski, senior vice president of the International Council of
Shopping Centers. The malls are expected to be in line with the
sales-growth estimates of 4 percent to 4.5 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Discount chains like Target _ a division of Dayton Hudson Corp.
_ and Wal-Mart Stores were the 800-pound gorillas of the season,
catering to throngs of people determined to get their scented
candles, George Foreman meat cookers, and Furbys at the lowest
possible prices. Some 80 percent of Americans were expected to buy
at least one holiday item from the discounters, up from 70 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, luxury retailers basked in the
stock-market comeback. Jewelry was particularly popular this year.
In Jacksonville, Fla., Mike Alexander bought gold bracelets for his
mother and sister because they already have ``everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything cashmere also had people cuddling up to the registers.
At Baby Gap Luxe, a miniature bubble-gum-pink cardigan with
matching pants, both made of the downy fabric, were racing out the
door for a mere $155 a set.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics retailers like Circuit City Stores Inc. and Best Buy
Co. benefited from consumers snapping up personal computers, many
of them now to be had for less than $1,000. And they enjoyed
increased sales from new products that are starting to enter the
mass market as prices drop. These include digital video cameras and
DVD players, which use compact-disc-sized platters to play movies
at home. They now are being sold for as little as $400.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart loomed as a presiding spirit this season as
products relating to the home, from chenille throw pillows to
leather easy chairs, were hot again. ``We've moved past apparel as
a Christmas item,'' Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL Retail, a
consulting and consumer research firm, said. ``Upscale consumers
are saying, `I don't need any more clothing.' In turning to the
home, people are being both fashionable and practical.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of the gifts these stores sold, of course, were neither.
At Restoration Hardware Inc., whose strong sales made it a leader
in homewares, the seasonal standout was a silver-plated cocktail
shaker shaped like a penguin, whose beak dispenses martinis.
</P>
<P>
   Preholiday markdowns were just as fierce as in years past.
Consumers have come to expect big discounts early in the season,
and retailers delivered them earlier than ever. Signs enticing
consumers to take 20 percent off were abundant around the country
right after Thanksgiving, as were newspaper coupons. The cuts
deepened with each passing week, particularly on cold-weather
items.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend before Christmas, the Bloomingdale's flagship store
at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue in New York was decorated like
the banquet hall in a medieval castle, with red banners hanging
from the rafters proclaiming an extra 15 percent off, even on many
items already marked down.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, from the standpoint of the retailer's bottom
line, is that many cuts were premeditated. Battle-hardened from
years past, many merchants have finally accepted that the intense
customer appetite for preseason sales cannot be wished away. Merle
Goldstone, a spokesman for Macy's West in San Francisco, said, ``We
anticipated a very competitive environment, took it into account
for our sales strategy, and are happy with the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the diving prices were painful for some retailers to
absorb, especially those who compete mostly on cost. ``This year
was an even more promotional year than last year,'' said Duncan
Muir, a spokesman for J.C. Penney, ``and that's going to hurt
around the margins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday before Christmas, which looks as if it will end up
as the busiest shopping day of the year, collided directly with the
House debate and vote to impeach Clinton. Shoppers and merchants
alike agreed, a little shamefacedly, that the moment of high
political drama had virtually no effect on people's efforts to
complete their gift lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's talked about anything but makeup all day. Isn't that
scary?'' said Joanie Kleinberg, who worked a Bobbi Brown cosmetics
counter on impeachment day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the historic events in Washington had affected her
plans to spend the day hunting for gifts, Chris Schneider, a
45-year-old accountant from Denver loaded down with shower gels and
lotions from Bath and Body Works, replied, ``No, and that's sad,
isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   For all retailers' hopes that the remarkably resilient economy
would fuel a gangbuster season with 6 percent or even 7 percent
gains, sales during the holiday season were nothing extraordinary,
roughly in line with sales gains throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably warm weather for much of December can be blamed for
depressing sales of winter apparel, but clearly that was not the
whole story. Many analysts pointed to a realignment of buying
priorities. ``Consumers are still spending a lot,'' said Judy
Tenzer, a spokeswoman for American Express Co., whose Retail Index
tracks buying patterns. ``They are just spreading it across a lot
more activities, like travel and parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Also benefiting from shoppers' search to provide a more intimate
gift than a sweater or bread machine was the spa business.
Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salons, for example, said purchases of
gift certificates for facials, body scrubs and the like are up 25
percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   Another warning sign, particularly for mall retailers, was the
holiday success of online merchants. Even before Christmas, online
stores had already racked up sales that match start-of-the-season
predictions of $2.3 billion, double what they did last year. The
question now, as the figures on online sales continue to be
collected, is whether they will manage to go well beyond these
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's, a unit of Federated Department Stores Inc., reported
that its World Wide Web site, launched in mid-November, was getting
10 million hits a day, far more than anticipated. Nordstrom Inc.
also experienced an electronic rush. Anna Schryver, spokeswoman for
Lands' End Inc., the mail-order apparel company, said that its Web
traffic ``had broken all records.''
</P>
<P>
   Being on the Internet, however, did not immunize Lands' End from
pressures facing other apparel merchants. The company, which has
been troubled lately and recently booted its chief executive,
started marking prices down even before the holiday season to
attract the growing number of consumers who will not lay down money
until they see a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   And while shopping on the Web remains a tiny fraction of the
estimated $174 billion in retail sales for the holiday season, that
did not stop Internet merchants from gloating.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com Inc., the cyberspace book-selling powerhouse, would
not release precise numbers, but said visitors to its Web site on
the day after Thanksgiving quadrupled from last year. ``1998 goes
down in history,'' Bill Gross, a company spokesman, said, ``as the
year the Internet became a mainstream alternative.''

<P>
   New Year's Eve this year may not mark the beginning of the new
millennium, but it is still a big event for lots of people. Anyone
planning a celebration may appreciate a little help from inventions
that were patented earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning a New Year's Eve party, for example, music
is essential. If you hire a live band, you can decide exactly what
tunes will be played. But if you rely on recorded music, you might
have to hear songs you don't like interspersed with the ones you
prefer. And who wants to spend New Year's Eve changing cassette
tapes or compact discs?
</P>
<P>
   Three inventors have come up with a system that allows shoppers
in music stores to create custom CDs. Gregory Alexander from Carol
Stream, Ill., David Volk of Clairton, Pa., and Steven Goldenbogen
from Pittsburgh patented a vending machine that allows customers to
choose pieces of music stored in a computer.
</P>
<P>
   A list of available songs is displayed on a screen. When the
customer types choices on a keyboard, a microprocessor in the
vending machine accesses digital music stored on a hard drive.
Finally, a list of the customer's selections is shown on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The microprocessor also controls an imprinting device that
``writes'' the customer's choices on a blank CD and then dispenses
the customized disc.
</P>
<P>
   The shopper pays for his new CD by swiping a credit card through
the vending machine.
</P>
<P>
   The invention belongs to Customdisc.com, an Internet company
that has licensed 185,000 music tracks so that customers of its
World Wide Web site can create 70-minute CDs with personalized art
work, titles, and messages to accompany gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Customdisc.com plans to market the invention by setting up
kiosks in music stores. The inventors received patent 5,633,839.
</P>
<P>
   Strike Up the Body for Party Music
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you prefer a one-man band for party music. Two Japanese
inventors have patented a system of generating music with foot,
hand, shoulder and elbow movements.
</P>
<P>
   Akira Nakada and Hisanori Katou designed a device to be worn as
a shoe plate, as hand grips, and as elbow and shoulder straps. The
shoe plate is shaped like a shoe sole and can be reduced or
expanded in size to fit any shoe. It contains a sensor that the
inventors say controls the timing of rhythm-section sounds such as
a snare drum, a bass drum and high-hat cymbals.
</P>
<P>
   The shoe plate can also be designed to control pitch, tone color
or loudness with taps of the foot. Squeezing the hand grips
manipulates the music's timing, while bending and stretching the
elbows and shoulders controls pitch and loudness through the
straps.
</P>
<P>
   A wireless transmitter in the shoe plate sends signals to a
receiver, which passes them to an interface unit and then to an
electronic instrument that generates the musical notes. The patent,
5,714,706, belongs to Yamaha Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For Pantyhose, a Third Dimension
</P>
<P>
   Women know what it's like to put a lot of thought and effort
into a New Year's Eve outfit only to discover a run in their
pantyhose halfway through the night. Well, never mind; Annette
Pappas from Metairie, La., has it covered. Ms. Pappas invented
hosiery with three legs. The garment, which looks like a
conventional pair of pantyhose, actually has three legs, each with
a pocket above it in the panty area.
</P>
<P>
   ``In use, the wearer inserts her legs into two of the leg
openings in the conventional fashion of donning a pair of
pantyhose,'' Ms. Pappas explains in her patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remaining unused leg portion is then gathered and the toe
end tucked into the pocket of one of the absorbent crotch members.
If a run or hole develops in one of the leg portions being worn,
the leg of the wearer can be easily and rapidly removed from the
damaged leg portion and placed into the undamaged spare leg
portion.''
</P>
<P>
   The stocking with the run in it is then folded and tucked away
in one of the pockets. Ms. Pappas does not say what the wearer
should do about the little lump of fabric that probably results.
She received patent 5,713,081.
</P>
<P>
   Cut-and-Scour Tool for Facial Wrinkles
</P>
<P>
   If looking your best for New Year's includes trying to eliminate
fine facial lines, you might want to consider David McAllister's
invention. McAllister, from Lake Mary, Fla., has created a
hand-held tool with a series of parallel small blades that he says
can reduce wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   He recommends selecting a wrinkle or line you want to reduce
and, with his tool, scratching matching lines adjacent to and on
either side of the wrinkle. The scratches you make are then cleaned
with anti-bacterial soap, dried and massaged with anti-bacterial
cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the lines scratched in the skin are permitted to heal,
the skin is found to be tightened,'' McAllister asserts. The
patent, however, does not discuss how safe this device might be.
And if you did want to use McAllister's invention, it would be wise
to start the procedure at least a week before any parties.
McAllister received patent 5,713,375.
</P>
<P>
   Like Having Venice in the Dining Room
</P>
<P>
   Tired of the same old buffet presentation? This year's
celebration could be graced instead by a water-borne system
patented by two California inventors. Yukio and Masako Iwamoto,
from Atherton, won two separate patents for their design of a
``hydraulic system for serving food.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Diners sit around a periphery of a water course, and food
carriers circulate in the water course and carry various types of
food,'' they write in their first patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food carriers are removably attached to an endless line
underneath the water by flexible wires so that each food carrier is
independently removable from the said water course,'' they
elaborated in their second patent. ``In addition, the flexible
wires are positioned along the endless line so as to maintain a
predetermined spacing between the food carriers in the water
course.''
</P>
<P>
   The spacing gives guests enough time to choose food and allows
hosts time to refill the food carriers. The Iwamotos received
patents 5,823,329 and 5,813,497.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington DC 20231.

   FBC-FIESTA _ Is Tennessee a team of destiny? Will Florida State,
like Florida in 1996, win a national championship thanks to the
hand of Fate? Those are just two of the questions to be answered in

season but have always found a way to win. They lost Jamal Lewis on

more talented teams than this one but this group could give the
Vols their first national championship since 1951. Florida State
was convinced it was out of the national championship race when it

`RAISED ON RADIO': THE JOY OF BEING A RADIO BABY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have
no friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because a woman is 35 or more, romance in life need not be
over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a joke, son!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That ain't the way I heee-e-e-ard it, Johnny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well...''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who can immediately identify these quotations is either a
trivia collector or a radio baby, as Gerald Nachman refers to those
of us who grew with our ears plugged in to a table-top Philco while
our eyes were affixed on homework. Until I read Nachman's
captivating, highly personal book, ``Raised on Radio,'' I didn't
realize _ or remember _ just how much a generation was conditioned
by that ubiquitous box of sounds, or how radio shaped our language,
conversation and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were also double features to look forward to on
Saturday afternoon, but as a daily diet, radio brought cultural
nourishment and escapism into the home: comedians, cowboys,
superhero serials, quiz shows, crooners, cliffhangers, sports and
even news (but only when it interrupted this broadcast).
</P>
<P>
   With the amplitude of a Ken Burns television documentary and
with the added asset of a keen sense of comic proportion, the
author takes the reader step by step through the story of radio,
which he calls ``the ultimate populist medium.'' Return with us now
to those thrilling days of yesteryear where the weed of crime
always bears bitter fruit and the mailbox is stuffed with secret
decoder rings: not just adventures with Jack Armstrong and Hop
Harrigan, but also with Margot Lane and Lorelei Kilbourne, those
super-efficient sidekicks.
</P>
<P>
   My introduction to drama was not on Broadway but with ``Lights
Out,'' `Suspense''' and ``The Lux Radio Theater,'' which during its
21-year history ``presented virtually every movie and play of
note'' in cut-down and ``occasionally cut-rate'' versions. The
stars of one's theatrical childhood were Les Tremayne (later
replaced by Olan Soule) and Barbara Luddy, those eternally
optimistic First Nighters who never failed to have their tickets
ready, please.
</P>
<P>
   Nachman finds heroes (George Burns and Gracie Allen, Jimmy
Durante and, especially, Jack Benny, the quintessential radio
comedian), along with several (Eddie Cantor, Red Skelton) he
disdains for their selfishness. A niche of honor is reserved for
the iconoclasm of Fred Allen, who once joined Orson Welles in doing
a five-minute ``Les Miserables,'' in which ``Welles has all the
lines as Jean Valjean and Allen's Javert is reduced to knocking on
doors and blowing a police whistle.'' When it is pertinent, we hear
about personal lives (the satyric side of Bob Hope), but
principally the book is concerned with what happened on the air and
just behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Nachman savors the absurdities: a mediocre
ventriloquist who became a radio star by playing straight man to a
dapper dummy. (And why was he wearing a monocle?) ``The Shadow''
was, he says, the oddest and wealthiest of crime-busters: ``It was
almost as if Donald Trump were to lead a secret life fighting crime
in New York dressed in fruity blue tights and boots.'' In
discussing ``The Green Hornet,'' he wonders, ``Why a hornet?'' and
``Why green and not yellow?''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the mystery of the Lone Ranger, called the Long
Ranger in Nachman's schoolyard. ``You only Ranger left,'' said
Tonto in the first episode after rescuing the lawman from a
massacre. What if the show had been called ``The Only Ranger''?
Tonto, by the way, was played for many years by an elderly
Shakespearean actor, who, we are told, tended to doze off during
episodes, once leaving the Masked Man (Brace Beemer) to improvise a
monolog.
</P>
<P>
   Radio was the land of the color-blind and the ageless, where two
white actors could personify Amos 'n' Andy, and where Mel Blanc and
other clowns with limber voices could move from show to show and
create a galaxy of contrasting characters. In sitcoms, special
mention is reserved for Eve Arden's pre-feminist ``Our Miss
Brooks,'' ``the first bright, independent, unmarried, working
female comic character on the air,'' someone who didn't need
Boynton to make her life complete.
</P>
<P>
   Even while he quotes Bob and Ray twitting ``One Man's Family''
as ``One Feller's Family,'' Nachman recognizes the reason for the
longevity of Carlton Morse's serial, which, he says, was inspired
by ``The Forsyte Saga.'' It depicted the day-to-day life of an
average family with a naturalness and a reasonable degree of
sophistication. As the author demonstrates, the most memorable
shows, like ``The Jack Benny Show'' and ``Dragnet,'' broke the
mold, a lesson still not learned by television. At the same time,
he is clear about the arc of broadcast history, how Charlie
McCarthy led to Kermit the Frog, how ``Duffy's Tavern'' begat
``Cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio programs were ineluctably identified with their sponsors
and their announcers. As the author says, ``Nearly every radio baby
can still sing or whistle the peppy Rinso White tune'' and dozens
of other jingles. Among the fascinating sideline characters are
Anne and Frank Hummert, writers and producers who filled daytime
radio with everything from ``Just Plain Bill'' to ``Keen, Tracer of
Lost Persons.''
</P>
<P>
   Nachman links the writers Arch Oboler, Norman Corwin and Himan
Brown as theatrical giants of radio. Himan who? A man of many
shows, he invented ``Inner Sanctum'' and its creaking door, which,
as he predicted, became a star, and one of the most famous sound
effects (along with Fibber McGee's closet).
</P>
<P>
   Just as sound movies replaced the silents, television silenced
radio as we knew it. As Nachman understands, it was the most
intimate of experiences, one place a child could go unaccompanied
by an adult. It was a theater of our imagination. There have been
many books on the subject, but none that I know of that is written
with such verve and joyful sense of rediscovery.
</P>
<P>
   The answers, by the way, are ``Boston Blackie,'' ``The Romance
of Helen Trent,'' Senator Claghorn on ``The Fred Allen Show,'' the
Old-timer on ``Fibber McGee and Molly'' and, if you don't know who
said, ``Well...,'' think it over.

TV GUIDE INVESTIGATES A FAILED INVESTIGATION  
 CHANNEL ONE'S AUDIENCE NOW A NIELSEN AUDIENCE  
 ANOTHER GLUM PORTRAIT OF AMERICAN JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a departure from its usual editorial fare, TV Guide _ the
couch potato's weekly bible that is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp. _ is running a four-part, 20,000-word investigative series
about CNN and the Tailwind debacle of last summer. It is a far cry
from a recent cover story, ``The Spellbinding Witches of Charmed,''
an article about a television program starring Shannen Doherty as a
witch.
</P>
<P>
   In the first installment of ``Tailwind: Behind the TV Story of
the Year,'' which arrived on newsstands on Dec. 21, almost six
months after CNN broadcast the report, Mary Murphy, a TV Guide
staff reporter, and Dennis McDougal, an investigative journalist
and author, scrutinized in painstaking detail the process by which
April Oliver, a CNN producer, investigated the story.
</P>
<P>
   The authors portrayed Richard Kaplan, the CNN/USA president, as
a man concerned more about ``glitz'' than substance, and wrote that
Tailwind was ``the biggest catastrophe in CNN's history'' and ``the
biggest blunder in its history.''
</P>
<P>
   In the issue that arrives on newsstands Monday, the second
installment states that John Stacks, an executive editor at Time
magazine, was seriously concerned about the truth of Ms. Oliver's
accusations that the United States used nerve gas against its own
troops, and that Pamela Hill, a CNN senior executive producer, had
``specifically forbidden'' CNN's military consultant, Maj. Gen.
Perry Smith, a retired Air Force officer, to work with the CNN
team.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hill said in an interview last week that she was not
alone in her hesitation to have the coverage vetted by a CNN
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were others as well as I who had some reservations about
taking the story outside at the time because of its specificity,''
Ms. Hill said about the TV Guide accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Why devote so much manpower and space to a subject that is 6
months old? Murdoch and Ted Turner, the founder of CNN, do not
enjoy the most personable of relations (Turner once compared
Murdoch to Hitler and Murdoch's Fox News channel is a fierce
competitor of CNN). But Steven Reddicliffe, the editor in chief of
TV Guide, defended his magazine's investigation into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a news story like this in television in
recent years,'' he said. ``When they do, if your magazine covers
television, you'd better cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN did not respond to the reporters working on the TV Guide
articles. Howard Polskin, a CNN spokesman, said CNN had made a
retraction and an apology to viewers in July, and would not comment
further.

<P>
   Channel One's Audience Now a Nielsen Audience
</P>
<P>
   Who pays much attention to Channel One, the 12-minute news
broadcast beamed directly into 12,000 American schools each day,
except perhaps the teen-agers who have to watch it? Certain
advertisers do, because teen-agers are an elusive and very
important audience.
</P>
<P>
   How important? Important enough that advertisers who buy
commercials on Channel One (two minutes' worth in each newscast)
want to know exactly what they are getting for their money, so
Channel One signed a five-year contract earlier this month with
Nielsen Media Research, the company that measures commercial
networks.
</P>
<P>
   After all, advertisers spend a premium to reach Channel One
viewers. The network charges $200,000 for its 30-second commercials
_ more than what is paid for most prime-time broadcast network
shows, and almost as much as was charged for the much hyped season
finale of the teen-agers' favorite ``Dawson's Creek'' on the WB
network last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have 8 million kids,'' said Jon Marks, senior vice
president for research at Channel One, a unit of Primedia Inc.
``That's three or four times as many viewers as the No. 1
prime-time show with teen-agers,'' which is ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Channel One can reach 8 million teen-agers, but it reaches
somewhat fewer on a given day, because of holidays, teacher
in-service days, school closings, or the contract's wiggle room,
which allows schools to decline the program for up to 10 percent of
school days.
</P>
<P>
   But why Nielsen? With a precise tally of schools under contract,
knowledge of how many students are in each class, and updates on
which days schools are closed, Channel One, it would seem, could
give advertisers a pretty good estimate itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's half the equation, whether school is in session,''
Marks said. ``The other half is: Did the school play the show that
day?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Put yourself in advertisers' shoes,'' he added. ``To them, the
difference between it being 7.3 million kids vs. 7.5 million on a
given day is very significant. It's a couple hundred thousand
viewers, equivalent to what they might get by running an extra spot
on MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   So are they skeptical that schools run Channel One as often as
promised?
</P>
<P>
   ``A little,'' Marks said. ``That's their job, though. We don't
begrudge them their skepticism.''

   Another Glum Portrait of American Journalists
</P>
<P>
   Journalists are too concerned with covering sex and are less
concerned with accuracy, fairness and avoiding bias, reports a
study released by the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Why Newspaper Credibility Has Been Dropping,'' the
study was based on telephone interviews with 3,000 Americans in
April and May and followed up with meetings of 16 focus groups. It
reports that readers say the credibility of all news media has
suffered in what is perceived to be a ceaseless chase after the
saucy, sexy story.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the statement ``Journalists chase sensational
stories because they think it'll sell papers, not because they
think it's important news,'' 53 percent of the study's respondents
agreed and 27 percent strongly agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the study's more intriguing findings: Journalists can be
manipulated by people in powerful positions, 78 percent of the
respondents said; journalists do not demonstrate consistent respect
for their readers and communities, three-quarters said; and the
people who say that journalists do not slant their reporting to
suit their own political beliefs are more likely to be Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the public regards journalists as
motivated and intelligent. The bad news, according to some in the
focus groups: Journalists ``like to see adverse things happen to
people.'' They enjoy their ``power.'' Saddest of all, perhaps, is
the belief of one focus-group participant: ``You wouldn't be a good
reporter if you were a nice person.''
</P>
<P>
   But print reporters can take heart in the finding that only 23
percent of respondents see print reporters as the worst
perpetrators of bias, while 42 percent see another, more pervasive
purveyor of bias: television.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to address the situation, the editors' group has
introduced the Journalism Credibility Project, a program that will
encourage eight daily newspapers _ including The Philadelphia
Inquirer, The Austin American-Statesman in Texas and The San Jose
Mercury News in California _ to build reader trust by focusing on
accuracy, trying to connect with readers and seriously weighing
which subjects are purely sensational and which are necessary news
items.
</P>
<P>
   The program will begin in the spring, but Lee Stinnett, the
executive director of the editors' group, said he was still
determining the specific ways in which newspapers can work on
accuracy and fairness _ presumably, goals they struggle to achieve
every day anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just sent out the study, and we're soliciting ideas
about how to achieve those goals,'' he said.

ADVERTISING COLUMN: E.T. RETURNS TO EARTH TO SELL SAFE DRIVING
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Ohio)   (ms) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

</P>
<P>
   E.T., phone your agent. Madison Avenue is calling.
</P>
<P>
   E.T., the anthropomorphic alien whose exile on Earth and journey
home were chronicled in the popular 1982 film ``E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial,'' will be the focus for a coming campaign by
Arnell Group Brand Consulting in New York for Progressive
automobile insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which is intended to sell safe driving rather than
insurance policies, will be broad based, ranging from a 60-second
commercial to appear before the halftime show of Super Bowl XXXIII
and materials for driver's education courses to Internet
advertising and an ``E.T. Safety Club'' for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural to use E.T. as a teacher, a champion, for
driving-safety issues,'' said Bob McMillan, marketing director at
the Progressive Corp. in Cleveland, the nation's fifth-largest auto
insurer.
</P>
<P>
   ``E.T. is, after all, a progressive being,'' he added, laughing,
``a higher life form.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which begins on Jan. 9 with teaser television
spots in National Football League playoff games, represents the
most widespread marketing effort involving E.T. Despite the huge,
sustained appeal of the film _it ranks among the
10-highest-grossing movies ever and still sells steadily on home
video _ E.T. has been seen only sparingly in ads and promotions or
on licensed merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the campaign is emblematic of the increasing
cross-pollenization between the popular and commercial cultures,
particularly in terms of so-called classic characters. Among others
that are joining or rejoining E.T. in the commercial realm are
Eloise, the mischievous 6-year-old living at the Plaza Hotel, and
the myriad characters like the Grinch and the Cat in the Hat
created by Dr. Seuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get to a point where you cross the line,
overmerchandise, use the character in ways that don't seem
appropriate,'' said Brad Globe, marketing head for Amblin
Entertainment in Universal City, Calif. ``Ultimately, the consumer
decides.'' Amblin, owned by Steven Spielberg, co-produced the film
with the Universal Pictures unit of what is now the Seagram Co.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, Globe said, he and Spielberg were receptive to
the campaign concept when it was presented by Arnell and
Progressive in late summer because ``E.T.'s becoming the ambassador
for highway and traffic safety, preventing accidents, buckling seat
belts, fighting drinking and driving,'' was an idea ``that isn't
exploitive, that stays true to who the character is.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, who was also the director of ``E.T., the
Extra-Terrestrial,'' said in a statement: ``E.T. holds a special
place in so many hearts. I'm extremely pleased that the values
symbolized by E.T. will be used to aid and address the issue of
safe driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns were also paramount among executives at
Progressive, McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be sensitive to the way people feel about the
character,'' McMillan said, ``and make sure E.T. is seen working on
what's an appropriate mission for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A safety message that's fresh and relevant, especially to
kids, is a great way to use the power the character has,'' he
added, ``and makes it a perfect association for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Amblin signed a multiyear contract for undisclosed terms,
McMillan said, giving the insurer rights to use E.T. in the
campaign as part of efforts to ``increase the public's awareness of
our products and services.'' The budget for the campaign is also
not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   When the film was released, there had been what was for that
time a comprehensive merchandising campaign, which included E.T.
books, video games, clothing, dolls and cereal. And there was, of
course, the bonanza enjoyed by the Hershey Foods Corp., which in a
landmark product placement deal agreed to provide Reese's Pieces as
the candy used by a boy to cement a friendship with the space
creature.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been sporadic E.T. campaigns, involving
the Special Olympics; the Pepsi-Cola Co &UR; . &LR;  unit of Pepsico Inc.,
for the 1988 release of the home video, and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. ,
for broadcasts of the film in the early 1990's. The character also
continues to promote the Universal theme parks in California and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very selective, very particular, over the years,
doing only limited marketing programs with E.T.,'' Globe said,
because ``Steven at a certain point just decided that because of
how special he feels toward the character and film not to do more
merchandising with E.T.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And there was also more of a focus on other movies we were
making,'' he added, like the Indiana Jones, ``Back to the Future''
and ``Jurassic Park'' films, which were ``pretty aggressively
marketed'' and generated multibillion-dollar merchandising payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Globe said, ``we're trying to do some things to keep
E.T. out there in front of people,'' especially for ``a whole new
generation of kids with a lot of different characters vying for
their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign helps ``to bring back E.T., alive and fresh,'' he
added, ``doing positive things.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will coincidentally revive E.T. four months before
the return of other famous space characters: the ``Star Wars''
contingent, who are being brought back by George Lucas in the first
of several new films.
</P>
<P>
   The E.T. campaign features an icon in the style of a traffic
sign, created by Arnell, which became the agency for Progressive in
August. The sign, in yellow, depicts a drawing of E.T., his
familiar lighted digit upraised, wearing a seat belt. ``Buckle
up,'' it urges.
</P>
<P>
   ``E.T. is a character of such fame and power, about healing and
love,'' said Peter Arnell, chairman at Arnell. ``He's a metaphor
for traffic safety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get kids to buckle up early on,'' he added, ``it
could significantly reduce the death rate.'' The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration is trying to raise the percentage of
seat &UR; - &LR; belt use by 2005 to 90 percent from 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will be part of Progressive's sponsorship of the
halftime show at Super Bowl XXXIII, to be televised on Jan.3 by the
Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of the News Corp. The trade publication
Adweek reported that Progressive paid $5 million to become an NFL
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be ``an extensive Internet presence,'' McMillan
said, on the Progressive Web site (www.progressive.com).

   By JOHN WILLIAMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Hiransomboon family moved here from Thailand in
1976, shortened their surname and began working at a variety of
businesses, including wholesaling flowers on Fannin Street.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, they bet on downtown redevelopment by purchasing an
empty lot across Texas Avenue from the aging Union Station. They
hoped, in time, to emulate the success of such immigrant families
as the Pappas or Fertitta clans. When the Ballpark at Union Station
was announced three years later, brothers Bruce and Nick Hiran
boldly envisioned a Thai restaurant-and-sports-bar, a taqueria and
a cafe to be called Home Plate BBQ.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of being on the verge of cashing in on the
ballpark's promise of 2.5 million fans milling around downtown, the
Hirans are instead in a fight with the Harris County-Houston Sports
Authority, which wants a bus transit center on the lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at us like, `You will make Texas Avenue look run
down,' '' Bruce Hiran said. ``They think we can't do anything that
will be congruent with Texas Avenue being a Main Street USA. They
don't think we're with the program and they bully us around.''
</P>
<P>
   Vignettes like this one have some downtown boosters worried that
Houston is re-creating the Astrodome downtown, essentially
surrounding the stadium with parking and public-use projects that
may not add to the ambience _ or economic vitality _ of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Eyeballing the critical two-block radius around the ballpark,
they see parking lots and other areas already dedicated for public
use. Less than half of the blocks are available to developers
expected to bring in bars, restaurants, lofts and other amenities
that have sprouted around similar ballparks in Denver, Cleveland
and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the sports authority wants to eat up two more blocks
with a park and bus center.
</P>
<P>
   And Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. is looking for possibly two
others for additional parking garages so his high-paying customers
don't have to walk far to games. Two years ago, McLane told
cautious voters that the ballpark would offer as much parking as
the Astrodome does.
</P>
<P>
   But, as is evident to anyone who goes to the Astrodome, building
a sports complex doesn't guarantee surrounding development,
especially when the area is rife with parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``That two or three blocks around the stadium are crucial,''
said Bob Eury, president of Central Houston Inc. and perhaps
downtown's biggest advocate. ``If they are filled with parking lots
and don't have a critical mass of bars and restaurants, fans drive
to the game, park, walk to the game and leave, just like they do at
the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes that much harder to develop in the future if people
walk through parking lots to get to the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Eury warned that without an array of interesting buildings and
businesses to keep the attention of passers-by on non-baseball
days, it will be hard to sustain growth immediately around the
ballpark, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver is the best model,'' Eury said. ``There are businesses
all around Coors Field. It is active, even when the (Colorado
Rockies) aren't playing.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the area around Coors Field had a huge head start. It
was an old warehouse district that had attracted substantial
residential developers from new urban dwellers seeking a change
from the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But Denver did something unique, said Bill Mosher, president of
the Downtown Denver Partnership. The city imposed a ban on
destruction of buildings until after the end of the first season.
It was aimed at developers who were considering tearing down
buildings for parking.
</P>
<P>
   The result?
</P>
<P>
   The 3,500 parking spaces the team has to the north of the
ballpark are rarely filled though the team averages more than
48,000 in attendance to each game. Mosher said fans prefer walking
through the neighborhood to the park, stopping for a drink or bite
to eat, rather than driving in and out.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, more than 40 bars and restaurants have sprung
up since the facility opened in 1995 as businessmen take advantage
of the fans who walk through the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``People complained that we were taking away property rights,
but we didn't want a bunch of parking lots. The whole beauty of the
baseball stadium is that it is part of the ambience of the area,''
Mosher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you end up with a sea of parking, you end up with a bunch
of cars. And when the game isn't on, the place is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston doesn't have many quaint buildings around its ballpark.
Of 39 blocks immediately around it, 15 are now either surface
parking lots or parking garages, including enough for the Astros to
park roughly 2,200 cars next to a stadium that will hold 42,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other blocks, 16 have buildings readily available for
development and eight are dedicated to structures like a church, a
youth league park or apartments for low-income dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   That can cause a problem with immediate development because
there are not many of the older buildings that small developers can
turn into a single establishment, said developer C. Richard
Everett, head of Century Development Co.
</P>
<P>
   Parking lots produce steady revenue and are relatively cheap to
build and maintain. That makes them costly to convert into other
uses. In addition, it costs more to build new from the ground up
than to place a bar into an existing building, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it harder for people like the Hirans to get a
toe-hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``What usually happens is the small guys first do a lot of work
in an area like that around the ballpark,'' Everett said. ``Once
they have made it, the big guys come in and throw around the big
bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a lot of places available for the small guys, it may
be hard to take that first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe there will be a natural progression of development
toward the ballpark from Main Street six blocks to the northwest.
Main Street has become the focus of lofts, restaurants and other
development catering to an influx of residents.
</P>
<P>
   But without focus on the blocks around the ballpark, there is
some question of whether that development will span the entire six
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The administration of Mayor Lee Brown, who campaigned on making
downtown a top priority, is working on street and sidewalk
improvements along the northern half of downtown. Among the most
important parts of the project is creating head-in parking which
will give shoppers easy access to shops expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Called Cotswold 2000, the $33.7 million project will initially
focus on Prairie, Texas and Crawford so the streets leading to the
ballpark are ready when it is scheduled to open in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration is doing no other planning for the area
immediately around the ballpark, said Al Haines, Brown's chief
administrative officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been a priority,'' Haines said.
</P>
<P>
   It has, however, been a priority to the sports authority, which
has been bullishly planning the area.
</P>
<P>
   The sports authority chairman, Jack Rains, said he is not overly
concerned about anything stifling the private sector. Land that
appears unusable now will thrive once money flows into the area, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been my experience in development that the site
(selection) may include demolition of what is there now,'' Rains
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is an attraction, development will occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Rains, the authority wants to use eminent domain to buy
two blocks, one for a park and the other for a bus station that
Metro has promised to build. In addition, the authority is
considering asking surrounding property owners to create a scenic
district around the park which would be able to impose restrictions
on businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He fears that strip joints and other less desirable businesses
might be attracted to the area.
</P>
<P>
   But Rains' actions have drawn criticism that the authority is
thwarting private developers who don't want to face further
regulations and who fear their land might be condemned by the
authority.
</P>
<P>
   People look at the Hirans and wonder if that will happen to them
should they want to develop there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to control everything,'' Bruce Hiran said.
</P>
<P>
   Rains said that while he respects property rights, he is looking
to the long-term needs of the area. It is possible the sports
authority may use eminent domain for other acquisitions, he said,
though he was not specific.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the sports authority has no plans to back down
on acquiring land for a park or a bus station.
</P>
<P>
   ``When building a stadium financed by 30-year bonds, it would
seem prudent, if not now, but certainly within the life of the
facility, that a mass-transit station would be needed,'' Rains
said. ``On traveling to other sports facilities, mass-transit
facilities have been integrated into and become a vital component
of the successful functioning of the facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ballpark to open in less than 16 months, few developers
are yet taking actions. Most officials believe that the serious
development will occur after the ballpark is opened, like it did in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Left to be known is whether the Astrodome experience will be
repeated downtown, or if the ballpark really will stimulate a
revival in the immediate area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very easy to wipe out the ambience,'' Eury said.
``We're constantly competing with two demands, moving traffic and
keeping a neighborhood feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that the first doesn't defeat the second.''

CHILDREN DYING IN HOSPITALS ILL-EQUIPPED BECAUSE OF SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ The greatest misfortune that has been visited on
3-year-old Isra Ahmed was not contracting leukemia. It was
contracting leukemia in Iraq at a time when the country's medical
system is all but paralyzed as a result of economic sanctions
imposed by the United Nations eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since Isra's illness was diagnosed earlier this year, she has
spent most of her time in the Saddam Central Teaching Hospital for
Pediatrics in Baghdad. She bleeds profusely from her nose, gums and
rectum. Her mother has bought her earrings and a colorful clip to
bind her thinning hair into a ponytail, but whatever diversion she
has is likely to be only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   In developed countries, the cure rate for leukemia approaches 70
percent. In Iraq it is near zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still not too late to save this girl's life if we can
give her a bone-marrow transplant,'' said Dr. Jasim Mazin, the
hospital's chief resident. ``But we don't have the equipment to
perform that kind of operation. We're helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   In his five years at Saddam Central, virtually all of his
leukemia patients have died. Their deaths , coupled with those who
die of gastrointestinal diseases, diarrhea, dehydration and other
easily curable ailments, have clearly taken a toll on him. He often
works 20 hours a day, and although he is just 28, he looks nearly
twice that age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq used to be the best country in the Arab world in terms of
science and medicine,'' Mazin said as he made his rounds on a
recent morning. ``Now we can't even read medical journals, because
they are covered by the embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I use disposable syringes on one patient after
another, or perform operations with worn-out instruments in
operating theaters that are not even disinfected,'' he said. ``It's
very difficult to work very hard on a patient, try to care for him,
and then lose him because you can't get some silly thing that you
could pick up in a drugstore in any other country.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is the best-supplied children's hospital in Iraq. If
you go out into the provinces, you see that things are much
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The coordinator of U.N. relief programs here, Hans von Sponeck,
toured hospitals outside Baghdad last month and reported that much
of the equipment he saw ``was fit only for a museum.'' He said some
of it is actually endangering the health of patients and staff,
such as X-ray machines that leak radiation and malfunctioning
incinerators that leave residues of toxic medical waste.
</P>
<P>
   Although the effect of sanctions is evident in every aspect of
Iraqi life, there are few places where it is more poignantly
visible than at hospitals like Saddam Central. According to U.N.
figures, government spending on medicine and medical equipment has
fallen by more than 90 percent since the sanctions were imposed
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and the country began spiraling
into economic collapse. Not a single new hospital has been built in
that time, although the country's population has grown from 15
million to 22 million.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi doctors say conditions have improved since 1996, when the
U.N. began allowing the government to sell limited amounts of oil
and use some of the income it earns to buy food and medicine. About
$450 million worth of drugs and medical supplies have entered the
country since then, though the United Nations says distribution is
inadequate owing to ``transport and logistic difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration defends sanctions as an indispensable
part of the Western campaign to bring down President Saddam
Hussein, whom Western powers have accused of threatening the Middle
East by building weapons of mass destruction. The administration
has, however, signaled its willingness to consider an expansion of
the oil-for-food program that could allow Iraq to improve the
abysmal conditions into which its heath care system has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Any improvement would probably come too late for most of the
children now lying listlessly in their hospital beds here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside the hospitals is where you have to go if you want to
see why so much antagonism and resentment is building up here,''
said Kathy Kelly, who runs a Chicago-based group called Voices in
the Wilderness that is campaigning against the sanctions and who is
making her ninth visit to Iraq since 1990. ``I've seen doctors go
from super-heroes to almost clinically depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   At Saddam Central, Mazin said he maintains his equilibrium by
concentrating on the children he has been able to save. He said his
worst period came last April, when he lost about 75 children during
a two-week epidemic of chest infections and gastroenteritis. Every
one of them, he believes, could have been saved with antibiotics
that are commonly available in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients at Saddam Central need more than medicine. Among
them is 16-month-old Affaf Hussein, whose facial irregularities
suggest congenital deformity. He suffers from recurrent pneumonia,
and his mother spends several hours each day holding a respirator
over his face so he can inhale moist oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This child is very sick,'' Mazin said. ``I believe he has some
kind of genetic disorder, but we don't have the tools to diagnose
what it is. We can't do anything for him.''

   One of the few bright spots at Saddam Central is a beaming
10-year-old named Marua Tariq, who comes in for a checkup every
month wearing her favorite brightly patterned sweater. She has
leukemia, but was released from the hospital six months ago after
her case stabilized, and has shown no symptoms since then. If she
can stay healthy for another four and a half years, she will be
considered cured, the first such case since the sanctions began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling good and I'm studying hard at school,'' Marua said
with a broad smile. ``When I grow up I want to be a doctor who
treats children.''

   MERCHANTS AND ANALYSTS PREDICT SOLID HOLIDAY SALES
</P>
<P>
   Largely undistracted by the impeachment of President Clinton and
the bombing of Iraq, U.S. shoppers appear to have spent freely from
wallets that still feel pretty fat, giving retailers a bright, if
not stellar, holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Though industry figures will not be officially reported until
early January, retail analysts and merchants are predicting that
December sales in big chain stores open at least one year will rise
for the second year in a row by as much as 4 percent to 5 percent.
Other retailers are expecting solid gains as well.
</P>
<P>
   DAIMLER FORECASTS '98 RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler, the world's fifth-largest automaker, said that
its 1998 combined sales would rise more than 13 percent and that
profit would exceed last year's figures of the combined
Daimler-Benz and Chrysler.

<P>
   NO NEED TO TOUCH THAT RADIO DIAL
</P>
<P>
   The promise of a crisp radio signal that can be heard anywhere
in the United States, considered a pipe dream a decade ago, appears
to be only about a year from reality. Two companies with government
licenses to bring satellite-delivered broadcasts to radio _ CD
Radio and XM Satellite _ have lined up technology and programming
partners and plan to introduce the services in 2000. Both would-be
satellite-radio broadcasters say they can build a business from
fee-paying listeners, who would need a satellite-radio adapter and
a palm-sized antenna, like the one held by Hugh Panero, the chief
executive of XM, to pick up the signals.

   TV GUIDE INVESTIGATES CNN REPORT
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from its usual editorial fare, TV Guide is
running a four-part, 20,000-word investigative series about CNN's
decision during the summer to broadcast and then retract a report
that the United States used nerve gas in Laos in the Vietnam War as
part of a secret mission to kill American defectors.
</P>
<P>
   WEB SITE FOR SENDING THE VERY BEST
</P>
<P>
   Amid this year's holiday bustle, Felicia Lindau opened
Sparks.com, which she bills as the ``world's largest greeting card
store.'' The store is actually a Web site, and it allows users to
browse through an online selection of more than 5,000 cards from
hundreds of publishers. In contrast, a typical neighborhood card
store carries 300 to 600 cards, usually from one major publisher.

<P>
   E.T. TO URGE SAFE DRIVING ON EARTH
</P>
<P>
   E.T., the alien whose exile on Earth and journey home were
chronicled in the popular 1982 film ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,''
will be the focus for a coming campaign by Arnell Group Brand
Consulting in New York for Progressive automobile insurance. The
campaign is intended to sell safe driving rather than insurance
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE SALES INTENSIFY TAX PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   Online sales exceeded expectations during the holiday season,
bolstered in part by the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which declared a
three-year tax moratorium for online sales. But the Internet only
intensifies a problem for states that has been brewing for decades
in the mail-order business: how to tax purchases that cross state
lines to prevent the erosion of revenue.

   TELECOM ITALIA TO SELL STAKE IN UNIT
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia, the world's eighth-largest telecommunications
company, has agreed to sell up to 80 percent of its Stream pay-TV
unit to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for as much as $118.8 million.

POLITENESS GOES A LONG WAY IN DEALING FOR DISCOUNTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Most consumers -- Saturn owners excluded --
wouldn't dream of buying a new car without trying to talk the
dealer down in price. But they'll turn around and pay full sticker
for home appliances, jewelry, hotel rooms and virtually everything
else.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's negotiable. And what do you have to lose if it's
not?'' explained Selwyn Gerber, president of Gerber Financial
Management in Beverly Hills. Gerber, who lectures corporate
purchasing agents on the art of negotiating, said the key to
successful haggling is to show a little class.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way to negotiate that is respectful,'' Gerber said.
``If done right, it can lead to an ongoing relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtesy and communication are key.
</P>
<P>
   If, not will
</P>
<P>
   Be polite, but never tell a salesperson you plan to buy
something. Always ask a tentative, if-derived question. For
example, ``If I were to buy this radio, what sort of discount could
you offer me?''
</P>
<P>
   Back for more
</P>
<P>
   Whatever price they come back with, tell the salesperson it
really isn't good enough. Tell them to please go back and do
better.
</P>
<P>
   Explain why
</P>
<P>
   The more a salesperson understands your position, the better
your chances of getting a discount. Don't say you want to pay $100
for an item. Say you need to because of your budget. People respect
needs far more than they respect wants.
</P>
<P>
   Lowball-plus
</P>
<P>
   If you have a target price that you want to pay for a negotiable
item, wait to see what price the salesperson asks. As much as their
figure is over the amount you hope to pay, counter with an offer
that is much below your target. In other words, if you hope to pay
$10,000 for a car, but a salesperson offers $11,000, come back with
$9,000. That way you're always headed toward your price, not
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Think local
</P>
<P>
   Independent local stores are more willing to negotiate than
large chains. And it won't hurt your karma to give them your
business.
</P>
<P>
   No-tell hotel
</P>
<P>
   When booking a hotel or motel room, always ask the ``rack'' or
standard rate. Then ask if there are any discounts they can offer.
Finally, ask to speak with the facility's corporate sales
representative. Taking these steps alone can usually save you
between 10 percent and 30 percent off the standard nightly rate.
</P>
<P>
   Help them help you
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for clothes at discount outlets such as Ross Dress
for Less, a scuff or snag on a shoe or sweater is usually all the
excuse a floor manager needs to knock the item's price down a few
or several dollars. Considering how picked over the goods in such
stores can be, you'll often be able to find such minor flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Know when to say when
</P>
<P>
   Just because you can haggle over something doesn't mean you
should. ``If you're buying flowers for your wife on your
anniversary, pay the $65,'' Gerber said. ``But if you're buying
flowers for a wedding and need a couple dozen place settings, be
sure to negotiate.''

CHINA JAILS MAN FOR INTERVIEW ON U.S.-BACKED RADIO NETWORK
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Dealing out the fourth lengthy prison term to
political dissenters in a week, China Sunday convicted a man for
``providing intelligence to hostile foreign organizations'' because
he gave an interview about farmer protests to the U.S.-financed
Radio Free Asia, a human rights group said.
</P>
<P>
   After an unusual Sunday trial in the southern province of Hunan
that lasted less than three hours, the defendant, Zhang Shanguang,
42, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, according to the group
Human Rights in China, based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang previously spent seven years in prison for organizing an
independent labor union in 1989. This year, before his detention in
July, he had formed a group to protect laid-off workers and tried
to register it with local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities, fearing social unrest at a time of rising
unemployment, appear to be especially fearful of any labor
organizations outside Communist Party control, and of any efforts
to link up disaffected workers with democracy campaigners.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, as part of the most severe crackdown on
dissidents here in two years, three longtime activists who promoted
a new China Democracy Party, Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai,
were convicted on subversion charges and given sentences of 11 to
13 years.
</P>
<P>
   At his brief trial Sunday in Huaihua City, Hunan, Zhang was
charged with ``illegally providing intelligence to hostile foreign
organizations and persons,'' according to his lawyer and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment specifically named a telephone interview Zhang
gave last March to Radio Free Asia in which he discussed a protest
against high taxes by 70 to 80 farmers in one Hunan county, and
another incident in which a farmer who refused to pay a tax was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous such farmer protests have been reported around the
country in recent years and top national leaders have spoken out
against high, unfair burdens put on peasants by local and county
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Free Asia, which was set up in 1996 and receives all of
its funds from Congress, broadcasts news and other programs into
China from transmitters in Central Asia and the Pacific. The
Chinese government sees the network as hostile and tries, with some
success, to jam the broadcasts, which often emphasize
democracy-related subjects that are banned in the national media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deeply regret this action,'' said Daniel Southerland,
executive editor of Radio Free Asia, speaking by telephone from
Washington Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In the March interview, Southerland said, journalists called
Zhang to verify reports of the farmer protests and ``he didn't say
anything that wasn't widely known _ certainly it wasn't national
security information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to do someone in like this, they can always find
an excuse,'' Southerland said. Radio Free Asia, which broadcasts in
native languages to eight countries where news is censored,
frequently quotes Chinese residents on its programs, though does
not use names when it appears the speaker would be endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling from the recent trials, China's remaining dissidents are
now waiting to see if the government will stop with the jailing of
a few leaders or continue on with more arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In general, only those who have been actively involved in
organizing the new political party or independent worker groups
have been imprisoned for any length of time. In contrast to earlier
decades, Chinese people today are fairly free to voice dissenting
opinions in private _ so long as they do not act on them.
</P>
<P>
   In two recent speeches, widely publicized by the official media,
President and Communist Party Chief Jiang Zemin stressed the
overriding importance of protecting social stability and said that
any threats to the supremacy of the Communist Party would be
``annihilated in the early stages.''
</P>
<P>
   Western governments as well as democracy advocates here had
hoped that China's signing this year of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights, which calls for free speech and
assembly, would lead to a softening of political controls.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks the government has made it clear that any
actions perceived to imperil Communist Party rule will be defined
as threats to national security _ and therefore outside the purview
of the global treaty and other human rights conventions.

BEFORE YOU INVEST, TAKE SOME ADVICE

<P>
   UNDATED _ Each year's Stock Trader's Almanac is filled with
pithy quotes offering investment advice from the most successful
investors and traders in Wall Street history. Here, for our holiday
weekend ruminations, are some of the best words of wisdom that
publisher Yale Hirsch has offered in recent editions:
</P>
<P>
   In this game, the market has to keep pitching, but you don't
have to swing. You can stand there with the bat on your shoulder
for six months until you get a fat pitch. (Warren Buffett)
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-nine percent of what most people see on television about
business is not only irrelevant but possibly damaging. (George W.
Goodman, a.k.a. Adam Smith)
</P>
<P>
   It's a buy when the 10-week moving average crosses the 30-week
moving average, and the slope of both averages is up. (Victor
Sperandeo)
</P>
<P>
   News on stocks is not important. How the stock reacts to it is
important. (Michael Burke, BEGIN ITAL Chartcraft END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   Better to sell too late than too soon in a momentum-driven
market, as stocks often go much, much higher. Let your stock hit at
least two lower tops and bottoms before you sell. (Jordan Kimmel)
</P>
<P>
   Beware of inside information ... all inside information. (Jesse
Livermore)
</P>
<P>
   With enough inside information and a million dollars, you can go
broke in a year. (Warren Buffett)
</P>
<P>
   Markets are constantly in a state of uncertainty and flux, and
money is made by discounting the obvious and betting on the
unexpected. (George Soros)
</P>
<P>
   Spend at least as much time researching a stock as you would
choosing a refrigerator. (Peter Lynch)
</P>
<P>
   The first rule is not to lose. The second rule is not to forget
the first rule. (Warren Buffett)
</P>
<P>
   I'm always turned off by an overly optimistic letter from the
president in the annual report. If his letter is mildly
pessimistic, to me that's a good sign. (Philip Carret)
</P>
<P>
   The people who sustain the worst losses are usually those who
overreach. And it's not necessary: Steady, moderate gains will get
you where you want to go. (John Train)
</P>
<P>
   Most periodicals and trade journals are deadly dull, and indeed
full of fluff provided by public relations agents. (Jim Rogers)
</P>
<P>
   You try to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when
others are greedy. (Warren Buffett)
</P>
<P>
   I measure what's going on, and I adapt to it. I try to get my
ego out of the way. The market is smarter than I am, so I bend.
(Martin Zweig)
</P>
<P>
   The worst mistake investors make is taking their profits too
soon and their losses too long. (Michael Price)
</P>
<P>
   If you can buy all you want of a new issue, you do not want any;
if you cannot obtain any, you want all you can buy. (Rod Fadem)
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with cash. It gives you time to think.
(Robert Prechter Jr.)
</P>
<P>
   A bull market tends to bail you out of all your mistakes.
Conversely, bear markets make you pay for your mistakes. (Richard
Russell)
</P>
<P>
   Almost any insider purchase is worth investigating for a
possible lead to a superior speculation. But very few insider sales
justify concern. (William Chidester)
</P>
<P>
   Your emotions are often a reverse indicator of what you ought to
be doing. (John F. Hindelong)
</P>
<P>
   Buy a stock the way you would buy a house. Understand and like
it such that you'd be content to own it in the absence of any
market. (Warren Buffett)
</P>
<P>
   The stock market is that creation of man which humbles him the
most. (Anonymous)

RENEGADES ESCAPE THE NECKTIE NOOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MAN FULLER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ They're the ties that
bind.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, not ropes or wedding vows _ neckties, those polyester and
silk nooses that millions of men around the world get for Christmas
and knot around their necks every day.
</P>
<P>
   A Dutch prince recently revolted, however, ripping off his tie
at a fashion gathering and tossing it to the ground, issuing a
rallying cry for men the world over to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   As the tie lay at the feet of his wife, Queen Beatrix, Prince
Claus snarled: ``A snake around my neck!'' That brought the crowd
to its feet in a chorus of cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, men throughout the Netherlands were rallying to the
prince's call. On the news that night, a television anchorman
stripped away his tie as he reported the story. The sports
broadcaster did the same while reciting soccer scores.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the lose-the-noose movement.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands the clamor is known as ``Claustrophilia,''
named after the 73-year-old Prince Claus.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Andersen, executive director of the Neckwear Association
of America, dismisses the prince's necktie revolt as rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   Women, Andersen said, find ties sexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans buy 90 million to 95 million ties a year,'' Andersen
said. ``They're not going to stop just because some impervious
prince says he doesn't want to wear a necktie anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen acknowledged that sales of ties in America already had
dipped from earlier this decade. A record number of ties _ more
than 100 million _ were sold in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   And while casual-dress Fridays probably have something to do
with the decline, Andersen said, a more likely explanation is that
men are buying fewer but better ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of spending $20 or $30 on a tie, they're now spending
$40, $50 or more for a tie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year men, women and children spent $1.4 billion on ties for
their fathers, husbands and brothers. Twenty percent of them were
bought in the December holiday season, and women bought more than
half of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ties are one of the few ways that men have of expressing
individuality when it comes to office attire,'' Andersen said. ``It
allows them to express themselves, whether subtle or bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Robinson, a vice president at the Federal Reserve in
Kansas City, smirked when he learned how much Americans spent on
ties last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``$1.4 billion? What a ridiculous thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said that in the fall of 1997, the Federal Reserve
decided to adopt a business-casual standard of dress for those days
when no outside meetings or groups of visitors were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Robinson said he always had a tie in his office _ the one
hanging with the suit jacket on the back of his door for
office-attire emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the change in dress code, Robinson said, he has
bought only two or three ties in the last year, compared with five
or six a year in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for Lynn Mitchelson, a senior vice president at
NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do like them from a fashion standpoint, but I'm a lot more
comfortable without one,'' Mitchelson said. ``I still like shopping
for a tie, but I buy fewer of them than I used to.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because his office also has adopted a business-casual
dress code for those days when no out-of-office meetings are
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   So whose bright idea were these neck-stranglers, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Some cite the Sun King, Louis XIV, who when visited by a group
of Croatian mercenaries at the royal palace admired their silk
scarves. The French word for tie, BEGIN ITAL cravat END ITAL, is
thought to be a derivative of ``Croat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ties evolved in various forms in the United States and abroad
until after World War II, when ties as we know them today emerged.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 that arbiter of American men's style, BEGIN ITAL Esquire
END ITAL, introduced the Bold Look _ a wide-shouldered jacket with
oversized lapels and a wide, spread collar, all topped off by a
5-inch-wide tie.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1940s ``narrative'' ties were all the rage, with
themes ranging from atomic bombs to man's best friend. Some men
chose garish Hawaiian ones with hula girls, including naked ones on
the back. Van Heusen produced ties in three sizes _ small, medium
and WOW.
</P>
<P>
   Today ties can be equally weird. A search on the Web turns up
dozens of sites selling them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the offerings are Rubber-Necker ties made from recycled
tires. Touted as the only ones that are dishwasher-safe, the
Rubber-Necker ties can be ordered in black, whitewall or
raised-white-letter styles.
</P>
<P>
   But with demand for ties declining, are they destined for
obsolescence?
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, who acknowledges that ties serve no real function,

BE WARY OF PARTY INVITATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are passing through the obligatory round of year-end parties.
Some of these are the soul of innocence and good cheer but some _
and I am thinking here particularly of office parties _ contain
much danger.
</P>
<P>
   Bosses and their underlings sit at table together and partake of
disabling beverages and make discreet eyes at one another's wives
and husbands. A sense of comradeship and equality is created which,
though brief, is quite convincing. Liberties are taken and matters
get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   At some office parties there are skits and other entertainments.
Preparation of this material ordinarily is left to younger
employees, creative and impetuous types who have not yet learned
the healthy uses of fear. It is a heady business.
</P>
<P>
   My observation has been that captains of industry, although they
may manage thin smiles for the record, do not really enjoy being
cleansed in the white fire of their hirelings' humor. They may not
bellow much as the wound is administered. But like a gut-shot Cape
buffalo, they are apt to wait later in the bushes.
</P>
<P>
   So I have gotten leery of parties, especially office parties in
this season. But not BEGIN ITAL just END ITAL those. The worst one
I ever saw followed a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   I had worked that year with a crew of tree trimmers, and as the
summer drew toward an end one of our crewmates announced his plans
for marriage. He was a tow-headed, solitary giant of a man,
self-contained and all but wordless. Once I saw him climb a huge
sycamore tree that was splitting at its crotch, overhanging
high-voltage lines, houses and garages with cars locked inside.
</P>
<P>
   There was no time for the electric company to disconnect the
power. So very matter-of-factly this silent, agile man crept out
without safety line, above the live wires, onto the sagging main
fork _ the tree making terrible screaming sounds below as the split
widened _ and attached a cable which held until it could be
dismantled and lowered in pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Never before or since have I seen so amazing an act of reckless
courage.
</P>
<P>
   Tree trimmers were then _ may still be _ a carefree, boisterous
and sometimes rowdy breed, as I would imagine lumberjacks to be.
Their excesses stemmed from high spirits, not from meanness.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the wedding was held upstairs in the bride's small house.
The event afterward was in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Washtubs of iced beer were emptied. Additional cases were sent
out for. The groom lost all the money he had in the world in a
craps game. Good-natured but violent fistfights erupted. Eyes were
closed and lips split.
</P>
<P>
   On toward midnight the wedded couple set out on their honeymoon,
carloads of the groom's colleagues in fast pursuit. Thirty minutes
out of town he turned his machine upside down on the turnpike,
without injury, and they all came back together to sleep it off.
</P>
<P>
   I often wondered afterward how that marriage worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that parties, however well-intentioned their
planning, do not have a uniformly joyful result. And that is why,
if it should ever happen that I am asked to join in the lampooning
of my betters at some office gathering, I will instantly and
cravenly decline.
</P>
<P>
   The season of merriment passes and the parties end. But the
wounds fester.
</P>
<P>
   I have not survived this long and made a safe little career by
going into the bushes after Cape buffalo with only an electric
typewriter and a felt-tipped pen.  &LR; txr:ITAL BEGIN Editor's note:

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ destruction rolls on.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKER HEAD ``PATRIOT GAMES''
</P>
<P>
   Political viciousness is as old as the republic. George
Washington faced charges about womanizing while he was president.
Thomas Jefferson couldn't escape it either.
</P>
<P>
   In 1796, the worst thing one could say about a politician was
that he was of mixed racial ancestry: Jefferson was hit with that
charge in his unsuccessful run for president that year.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Sen. Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist crusades set
a standard for mean-spiritedness.
</P>
<P>
   But the nastiness has reached a perhaps unprecedented frenzy in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans point to the 1987 fight that Democrats waged against
Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork as the starting point. Democrats
point to the attack two years later against the tough-talking
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan's choice of Bork was seen as a pivotal battle
over the court's future direction.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats wasted no time. On the same day Reagan sent his
nomination to Capitol Hill, Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts released a statement accusing the nominee of
advocating ``an extremist view of the Constitution'' and of
harboring ``Neanderthal'' views on civil rights and the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced
into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch
counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight
raids,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over Bork, who ultimately lost his nomination battle,
marked what some say was the first time a coalition of
special-interest groups teamed up to oppose a presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   And the battle upped the ante on invasion of privacy when
Democrats sought records of Bork's video-store rentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Democrat, I will say the Democrats should rue the day
when they made one simple act _ the day they subpoenaed Robert
Bork's videos,'' former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos said
recently on ABC News' ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright's resignation came after 45 days of tension over his
failure to disclose thousands of dollars in alleged gifts. He also
was alleged to have circumvented rules on speaking fees through
bulk sales of a book. He never admitted wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said afterward that he was told his ouster was payback
for the Democrats' rejection earlier that year of Republican John
Tower, President Bush's choice for defense secretary. One of
Wright's fiercest critics turned out to be Gingrich, then a rising
GOP star.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be an 11th Commandment on Capitol Hill,'' Wright
said last week. ``Thou shalt not demagogue against thy colleague.
Now, if it's even remembered today, it's mentioned as a joke
probably.''
</P>
<P>
   The press has also played its part. Just months before the Bork
fight, the press had responded to Democratic presidential candidate
Gary Hart's challenge to catch him in an adulterous affair.
Reporters from /{The Miami Herald}/ hid outside Hart's town home
and wound up doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come was the sensational and bitter 1991 battle over
Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court, which Thomas eventually
won. The hearings were highlighted by Anita Hill's charge that
Thomas had sexually harassed her years before.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Danforth, who as a U.S. senator from Missouri defended
Thomas, later decried the blood-sport nature of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do not like what a person thinks, you have a license to
kill,'' Danforth said in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   All these incidents served only as precursors for what lay ahead
in the 1990s with Clinton and Gingrich, who led the Republican
takeover of the House in 1994. Through the 1980s and the early
1990s, Gingrich used his confrontational style to fuel GOP
prospects. He demonized Democrats as ``corrupt guardians of the
liberal welfare state'' and ``the enemy of normal Americans.'' He
even chastised Bush, president from his own party, for abandoning
his ``no new taxes'' pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt's idea was to tear the House down and build it up all
over again in the way he wanted,'' said former U.S. Rep. Harold
Volkmer, a Missouri Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's attack-dog style carried a price. Reports surfaced
about Gingrich's own womanizing, and in 1997 he became the first
speaker to be formally reprimanded by his colleagues. He was
penalized $300,000 for making misleading statements in an
investigation of whether he used tax-exempt funds for a politically
oriented college course. MORE

   BREAKER HEAD ``ROOTED IN PARTISANSHIP''
</P>
<P>
   These days intense partisanship is inbred in House members
almost from the moment they arrive in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Snowbarger, the Olathe Republican who lost his seat in
Congress last month, recalled his freshman orientation in 1996
shortly before assuming office. What struck Snowbarger was how
Democrats and Republicans were kept apart. In the nearly two-week
orientation, members of the two parties spent only about two hours
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, Republicans and Democrats are separated at
birth,'' Snowbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   That's only one cause of the ongoing rancor. Snowbarger also
cited the narrow Republican House majority of just a dozen seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the Democrats are within striking distance of retaking
the House, there's no incentive for them to cooperate,'' Snowbarger
said.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of evangelical Christians as a potent political
force adds another complication, said Jim Slattery, a former
Democratic congressman from Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have trouble dealing with conservatives who feel
they are on a mission from God to impeach Clinton and defend the
country against a decline in cultural values, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberal Democrats don't understand that,'' Slattery said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright puts much of the blame on weak and outdated
campaign-finance laws that allow political parties to raise money
in $100,000 chunks. The money, in turn, is used to buy
hard-hitting, 30-second political ads. While many of the ads are
technically true, they are often misleading _ and terribly
divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best buy in a TV ad is to destroy your opponent by saying
something in 15 seconds that puts him on the defensive in a way
that he can't explain in fewer than 15 minutes,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that any action can be blown out of proportion makes
many members edgy and wary. ``They don't trust each other,''
Volkmer said of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   Some say a lack of sharp disagreement on major issues is another
contributor to the negative politics. Differences on key issues,
such as Social Security, really are minor when viewed from a
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have a sharp difference of opinion, then it's
easy for the politics of personal destruction to fill the void,''
Slattery said.
</P>
<P>
   Most incumbents feel free to shoot partisan spitballs because
their seats are theirs for the keeping, for almost as long as they
want. In November, for example, 395 of 401 incumbents who sought
re-election won.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan harassment has become a cottage industry in Washington.
Dozens of groups on both sides of the political spectrum seek to
raise money to fight what they consider the evil doings of their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bet your bottom dollar that the liberals don't want us
to learn the truth about Clinton's role in the Whitewater,
Travelgate, FBI Filegate and Kathleen Willey scandals,'' proclaims
a recent fund-raising letter from a conservative group known as
Radio America.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and I may be Starr's only chance to hold Clinton
accountable for his outrageous behavior. Please, send what you can,
but send it today!''  &LR; brk:What is lacking  &LR; tx:If there is a
solution to ending the unceasing warfare, it seems to be a
restoration of two rare commodities _ respect and reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a balance of judgment on both sides,'' said former
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum Baker of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of St. Louis agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to stop this spiral is for all of us to finally
say, ``Enough,' '' Gephardt said in a speech on the House floor
earlier this month. ``Let us step back from the abyss, and let's
begin a new politics of respect and fairness and decency.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the expected refinement of the independent counsel
law will help.
</P>
<P>
   But with Flynt's January issue looming and the impeachment
process continuing in the Senate, few people expect a more civil
environment anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a Democrat up there now, I wouldn't hesitate if I
found out something about a Republican to go after him,'' said
Volkmer, who lost his seat in 1996. ``You're fair game. After all,
look what you've done to my president.''

IN D.C., AN ANGRY POLITICS PREVAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When Texas Democrat
Jim Wright resigned as speaker in 1989 over ethical questions, he
stood in the well of the House and decried the spirit of ``mindless
cannibalism'' that had lawmakers preying on each other's
reputations.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Let me give you back this job,'' he said. ``Let that be a
total payment for the anger and hostility we feel toward each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright's hope of ending the ceaseless backbiting through his
sudden departure was a ``foolish expectation,'' he says now.
</P>
<P>
   For good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzied, ever-deteriorating culture of personal assault has
persisted in Washington, undermining many public officials.
</P>
<P>
   For some, such as Gary Hart, Clarence Thomas, Henry Hyde, Barney
Frank, Henry Cisneros and Robert Livingston, the weapon was their
sexual histories, true or untrue. For others, such as John Tower
and Douglas Ginsburg, it was alcohol or marijuana use. For still
others, such as Newt Gingrich and President Clinton, it was a
combination of alleged sins.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some of the officials committed dubious acts, others
used questionable judgment, and most deserve little sympathy. But
each case illustrates the new way of doing business in Washington
that emphasizes investigations and lawyers and endless hearings
over more chivalrous deliberation and compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In short, if you can't beat your political opponents, destroy
them. The new way even has its own names _ ``toxic politics,''
``sexual McCarthyism'' and ``the politics of personal
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Ginsburg, a Johns Hopkins University political
scientist, has tabbed it ``the politics of R.I.P.: Revelation.
Investigation. Prosecution. And rest in peace for those caught up
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   This angry form of politics is prompting some Washington
lawmakers to say they've simply had enough and will not run for
re-election. It has driven a mile-wide chasm between Republicans
and Democrats, particularly in the House. And it is stifling
progress on important legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Damaging as it is, observers say the carnage still may not be
over.
</P>
<P>
   For many reasons, the politics of personal destruction has
become embedded in Washington culture. Political parties have
become more ideological, making compromises harder to forge. The
end of the Cold War meant the loss of a common enemy and a powerful
unifying force.
</P>
<P>
   Putting television cameras inside the Capitol placed a premium
on tough talk. The media haven't helped. Want to get quoted in a TV
or newspaper story? Trash someone.
</P>
<P>
   And Congress, in its post-Watergate zeal to clean up government,
instituted a slew of ethics laws aimed at ensuring purer lawmakers.
But the move added potent new weapons to the political wars _
investigation and prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   One of those new laws was the much-maligned independent counsel
statute that gives prosecutors unlimited freedom. The law led to
Kenneth Starr's exhaustive investigation of Clinton and other
multimillion-dollar probes that, in some cases, came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which office do I go to to get my reputation back?'' asked
former Labor Secretary Ray Donovan, who was cleared following a
1980s investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Larry Flynt, publisher of /{Hustler}/ magazine,
announced that he soon would produce a special edition of his
magazine that would offer new details about Livingston and other
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a result of his offer of up to $1 million for
anyone producing ``evidence of illicit sexual relations'' with top
federal lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of personal destruction rolls on. MORE

REPUBLICANS NOT EXPECTING LONG-TERM DAMAGE FROM IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Conn., Mich., Minn., Ohio, R.I., Vt.)  (See also IMPEACH-RDP) 
(rl) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite post-impeachment polls showing that the
Republican Party's standing has sunk to its lowest level in years,
leading Republicans insist they are not worried that the party will
suffer long-term damage, because they expect the Senate to settle
the matter quickly.
</P>
<P>
   This extraordinary sense of confidence has surprised some
Republicans and many Democrats, who warn that it is far from
certain that the Senate can avoid a prolonged, ugly impeachment
trial. They contend that just as voters punished Republicans for
the government shutdown and never forgave President Bush for
reneging on his no-new-taxes pledge, the public might still blame
Republicans in the 2000 election for an impeachment inquiry that
disrupted the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But in dozens of interviews, prominent Republicans on Capitol
Hill and far beyond this city contended that voters would reward
politicians who fearlessly pressed on _ even against the polls _
and followed their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about the short-term damage,'' said former
Rep &UR; .  &LR; Vin Weber of Minnesota, an influential conservative who
expects the coming presidential campaign to obscure the White House
scandal. ``The only reason that I'm not in full panic mode about
the long-term damage is I think the presidential race will to a
great degree define the parties going into 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler of Michigan put it this way: ``This will be
long past by 2000. And those who defended the president most
vigorously may be the ones most embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans expressed less certainty about the outcome but
said they had no alternative but to plunge forward rather than
allow themselves to be swayed by scenarios of what may or may not
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Though they may cite principles, the Republicans are being
prodded toward the Senate trial by intense pressure from
conservatives; many want to see Clinton forced out of office, no
matter the repercussions for the party. And conservatives are some
Republican senators' most outspoken and reliable supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run this will not be damaging to the Republican
Party,'' said former Vice President Dan Quayle, a favorite of
conservatives who is expected to run for president in 2000. ``I'll
be very surprised in November of 2000 if Democrats are going to
make the impeachment of Bill Clinton an issue _ whether he's there
or not. The American people aren't going to want to rehash that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing the notion of a protracted trial as ``scare tactics''
from Democrats, Quayle said: ``I don't think this will drag out.
The Senate won't let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, agreed with Republicans who thought
voter unease about the impeachment matter would fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are going to quickly look beyond that,''
he said. ``If you get a political party in the year 2000 that says,
`I'm going to better educate your child,' the people will forget
this.'' Conceding that his comments were at odds with other
Democrats who think Republicans are damaging themselves, Romer
said, ``I could have taken a hard partisan shot here and tried to
help Democrats, but I just don't think it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other Democrats disagreed. ``If I were running as a
Democrat in the year 2000, I'd be after those guys from right
now,'' said former Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the
Democratic presidential nominee in 1988. ``They say memories are
short,'' he said of Republicans. ``I'm not so sure.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Republicans should remember their surprisingly poor
showing in the midterm elections this year. ``Something rather big
happened in November,'' Dukakis said. ``How do you explain that?''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans _ Gov. George E. Pataki of New York has been
one of the most outspoken _ have also warned that the party was
undermining itself in its handling of the Clinton scandal. Their
fear is that Democrats will portray Republicans as blindly partisan
in their zeal to topple the president.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Democrats are seizing on the House impeachment vote for
political advantage. They are plotting to find potent Democratic
opponents to take on moderate House Republicans who supported
impeachment, such as Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   And in a small but troubling development for Republicans, local
election officials around the country in recent days have reported
that some voters are switching their party registration from
Republican to Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big risk for control of the House in the year
2000,'' said Sen. James Jeffords of Vermont, one of the most
moderate Republicans. ``Certainly the impeachment process is going
to be fresh in people's minds. Unless we can change that present
huge dip in confidence of people in the polls, we're going to have
a tough time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans said the best evidence that they were not
driven by partisanship was that if Clinton was ousted from office
and Vice President Al Gore was thrust into the presidency, that
would give Gore an edge in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he becomes president I think he'd be very ineffectual,''
said Quayle, who was Gore's predecessor. ``But it's easier to run
as an incumbent president than as a vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords said there would be ``public sympathy for somebody who
gets thrust into that job in unusual circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet others questioned that popular wisdom. ``There's as much to
argue that Gore would be weaker once people got exposure to what he
would stand for as president,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the electoral consequences for the party, many
Republicans, particularly senators who are faced with deciding
Clinton's fate, spoke with a sense of resignation, saying the party
has little choice but to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I can read the polls, I see what they say,'' said Sen.
Mike DeWine of Ohio. ``I'm aware that the visceral reaction when I
talk to people in Ohio is basically, `Make it go away.' I
understand that. But the House has set in motion a constitutional
process that has only been set in process once before. For us to
duck our responsibility because it's the easiest thing to do is
morally wrong. I can't worry about what this means in an election
in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, said: ``They didn't hire me to
respond to every poll that came along. I'm not a weather vane. I've
always said that to the people at home and they understand it:
They're paying me to use my best judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most prominent Republicans interviewed around the country
cling to the belief that they can weather the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own feeling is that the American people have a very short
attention span,'' said Lyn Nofziger, a former aide to President
Reagan. ``We've got more than a year ahead of us. I just don't see
any way to say the Republicans are in trouble or the Democrats are
in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're going to throw him out,'' he added,
saying that senators ``owe it to the process to go ahead and have a
trial and make people stand up and bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber said that while ``the real wild card is a prolonged Senate
trial with an uncertain outcome,'' that could be damaging to the
Democrats, too, because ``it could be at that point that the case
against the president does begin to resonate with the public.''
</P>
<P>
   But like many other Republicans, Weber made the point that
timing is everything. ``If we were on the eve of an off-year
election, I'd say we were facing a disaster,'' he said. ``Of
course, we just had one, didn't we?''

SOUTH AFRICAN WOMAN BEATEN TO DEATH AFTER ASKING FOR AIDS
TOLERANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ A volunteer working to persuade
South Africans not to discriminate against HIV-infected people was
beaten to death last week by her neighbors, who accused her of
bringing shame on their community by revealing that she was
HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   The killing scared other anti-AIDS advocates and said it proved
what they have said for years _ although 3 million South Africans
are infected with the virus that causes AIDS, nearly all are afraid
to admit it because of the hostility they face.
</P>
<P>
   The woman killed, Gugu Dlamini, 36, a volunteer field worker for
the National Association of People Living With HIV/AIDS, went
public on World AIDS Day, Dec. 1, speaking about her HIV infection
on Zulu-language radio and on television.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, according to nurses who knew her, she was repeatedly
threatened by neighbors in her township of KwaMashu, outside
Durban, who said she was giving their community a bad reputation.
Last Monday, she was punched and slapped by a man who told her that
many others who were sick kept quiet about it.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has the world's fastest-growing AIDS epidemic,
according the the latest Unaids reports, and KwaZulu-Natal, where
Ms. Dlamini lived, is the worst-hit province. Up to 30 percent of
adults there are infected.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Dlamini called the police that day, they did
nothing, friends told a local newspaper. That night, a mob attacked
her house and stoned her, kicked her and beat her with sticks. She
died the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a nice, bright woman, and now her child is an orphan
because of AIDS,'' said Mercy Makhalemele, a Durban-area
administrator for the association. ``But not because she died of
it. Because she was trying to exercise her constitutional right to
freedom of speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Prudence Mabele, the first black South African woman to admit
being HIV-positive, said she was threatened many times after coming
forward in 1994. She moved out of her township into downtown
Pretoria largely out of fear, she said. A gay San Francisco group
wrote letters to her local police station then, and it seemed to
help. ``But I just don't know if people should come out now,'' she
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Osborn, a former local leader of the association, said he
thought the killing would ``put the cause of people with AIDS two
steps back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Makhalemele said she was not sure, thinking it might
galvanize anger in the small activist community.
</P>
<P>
   They have an uphill task. The head of the association, Peter
Busse, said last month that fewer than 100 of the country's 3
million infected people were completely open about it. ``When
something like World AIDS Day comes around, we have trouble finding
20 people to go on television and radio shows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dlamini's death is not going to galvanize much right now.
U.S.-style activism about AIDS does not exist in South Africa, and
all the association's chapters are closed for Christmas-summer
vacation. ``I'm waiting for Jan. 4. to make a big hoo-hah about
this,'' Ms. Mabele said. Ms. Makhalemele said she hoped to have a
protest march in Ms. Dlamini's memory organized by late March.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the KwaZulu-Natal health department called the
attack ``sheer stupidity'' and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who
promoted AIDS awareness in his Christmas message to the nation,
said: ``It is a terrible story. We have to treat people who have
HIV with care and support, and not as if they have an illness that
is evil.''

BOXING CONTINUES ITS REVIVAL WITH IMPORTANT BOUTS IN '99
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the end of 1997, boxing was flat on its back, being counted
out as a sport that mattered. Bickering between a promoter and a
cable network had scuttled plans for a heavyweight unification bout
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, the only match that the
general public cared to see. The sport's biggest attraction, Mike
Tyson, had had his license revoked for biting Holyfield's ears. And
no one was even talking about matching up the best boxers in their
respective divisions against each other.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1998, boxing is back on its feet, battered yet
still in the fight for viability thanks to a flurry of meaningful
matches in the last quarter of the year, and the promise of more
meaningful bouts in the first three months of 1999. Add to that the
latest return of Tyson, the former heavyweight champion, and boxing
is again in a position to grab the public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing will continue to revolve around the way matches unfold on
television, mainly on cable and pay-per-view. The promoter Don King
has ended his longtime estrangement from HBO, and together they
could forge one of the most powerful alliances in boxing in 1999.
The fruits of that alliance so far are the Felix Trinidad-Pernell
Whitaker bout on Feb. 20 and Holyfield-Lewis on March 13.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, USA Network canceled its ``Tuesday Night
Fights'' program in 1998, eliminating a showcase for up-and-coming
boxers. ESPN shifted its boxing program to ESPN2, a smaller outlet
with less visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, HBO recorded its ninth consecutive double-digit
rating with its last boxing show of the year on Dec. 19. At the top
end of the scale, boxing is doing well. With emerging stars like
Floyd Mayweather Jr., Shane Mosley and Michael Grant and
established stars like Roy Jones Jr., Oscar De La Hoya, Holyfield
and Tyson, 1999 promises to be exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing always has a cold,'' said Seth Abraham, president of
Time-Warner/HBO Sports. ``It's never completely healthy. But it is
in as robust health now as it has been in a long time. There's a
resurgence. If you go back three months and go through June 1999,
boxing is on a high-octane vitamin. The big question is whether the
people in the sport are going to be able to take advantage of this
bull market and make it run longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of boxing's ill health can be traced to the tangle of
competing and conflicting interests that have always threatened to
strangle the life out of the sport. Promoters only want to make
matches in which they have future options on both fighters, so that
whoever wins is still tied to the promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Managers of world championship boxers do not want their clients
in the ring with someone capable of beating their man and taking
his title. The sanctioning organizations, often manipulated by
boxing promoters and managers, have questionable ranking systems.
Thus arises a match like Oscar De La Hoya versus Patrick
Charpentier, the World Boxing Council's No. 1 welterweight
contender at the time, in a title fight. Charpentier landed five
punches before De La Hoya knocked him out in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The cable networks, mainly HBO, are acting as de facto
promoters. HBO has signed several boxers to exclusive and lucrative
contracts. This practice irritates some promoters. But they keep
coming back, because there are no other outlets that pay as well.
Showtime has only one boxer under contract, Mike Tyson. But that's
enough, because he is a pay-per-view champion and is an industry
all by himself.
</P>
<P>
   The promoter Cedric Kushner has started his own television arm
called Cedric Kushner Sports Network, and syndicates boxing shows
around the world. Kushner, however, also deals with HBO and has no
problem with them signing boxers to exclusive contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is that any different than NBC signing a particular show
for a series?'' Kushner said. ``You go back to the whole concept of
options. Where does it say that HBO should develop and showcase
fighters so that they can go someplace else? And look at the
terrific situation for fighters, knowing they're going to be
guaranteed money and be very visible. I see it as a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson did not box at all last year because his license was
revoked by the Nevada State Athletic Commission after he bit both
of Holyfield's ears during a title bout on June 28, 1997. His
license was reinstated on Oct. 19, after a battery of psychological
tests. The return of Tyson could be the tide that raises all of
boxing _ or sinks it lower, if there is more biting. The sport
proved it could survive without a major attraction like Tyson, but
he definitely brings back the thrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a Super Bowl four times a year,'' Kushner
said of Tyson's return to boxing. ``He puts a focus on boxing, on
the heavyweights in particular, and on how much money there is in
this sport.''  &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Doug Herzog is, he admits, a cable guy.
</P>
<P>
   His 18-year career in television has been spent almost
exclusively working for the most identifiable cable names in the
business, from CNN to MTV to Comedy Central. He has done almost
everything in cable short of entering homes and installing wires.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has decided to make a change so startling that even he
describes it as ``virtually a negative of my life so far.'' He is
going to broadcast network television, taking _ in his new position
as president of Fox Entertainment _ one of the signature jobs in
network television: chief programmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been raised, as it were, to battle the networks and
disparage the networks,'' Herzog said in an interview recently at
the Cosmic Coffee Shop on Broadway in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, he is assuming the job at a time of almost unparalleled
upheaval in the executive ranks of network television. Half the top
network programmers have left their jobs since the current
television season began. Ratings continue to decline across the
board as networks struggle to find hit shows to break through the
ever more competitive prime-time landscape. Program costs are
soaring and profits plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment is seen as particularly intriguing because of
the ways he might change Fox. Herzog, who oversaw such irreverent
breakthrough shows as ``Politically Incorrect'' and the raunchy
``South Park,'' does not come from the talent pool that has
traditionally produced network programmers: executives from the
network's own entertainment-development staffs or the television
studios that supply the programs.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has sought to position itself as the network that seeks to
break the old network rules, but this is the first time even Fox
has stepped outside the familiar Hollywood program-development
hierarchy to select an executive without one day of network or
studio experience.
</P>
<P>
   Even the location of the interview spoke to Herzog's deep cable
roots. The Cosmic has been something of a seminal site in the
history of cable television, the place where early executives from
MTV met to hatch plans to start shows like ``Real World'' and
``Unplugged,'' and more recently where executives from Comedy
Central (now in MTV's old office space in the same building as the
coffee shop) have met to ponder how to take advantage of the
merchandising windfall from ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzog acknowledged that he had paid almost no attention to the
programming of network television while running Comedy Central.
``Quite honestly, I make no bones about it,'' he said. ``Over the
past 3.5 years I've watched nothing but Comedy Central and Yankee
games.''
</P>
<P>
   If he thought anything about network television shows, he said,
it was mostly to express disdain for them. ``When you see so many
resources, so much money being spent, as a cable guy you just get
frustrated that there's so little quality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So what is this deep-dyed cable executive, who has spent his
whole career to this point disparaging network television, doing
taking control, on Jan. 11 officially, of a network's prime-time
schedule? He is, essentially, defining a network strategy that has
taken another longtime cable executive, Scott Sassa, formerly of
the Turner cable channels, to the same top programmer's job at NBC,
a strategy that goes along the lines of ``If you can't beat 'em,
hire 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives pointedly described the selection of Herzog in
those terms, saying they were seeking to bring in a fresh thinker,
one unencumbered by associations with what increasingly is seen as
a hidebound network system of programming.
</P>
<P>
   If that is this case, Herzog said, they are getting precisely
what they want in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could make the argument that I'm unqualified for this
job,'' Herzog said. ``Certainly in terms of network program
development.'' Citing the modest amount of work he has been able to
do in trying to get himself up to speed on the forthcoming pilot
crop at Fox, he said, ``In just the past couple of weeks I've
probably read more scripts than I have in the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he faced ``a huge learning curve on the
mechanical side of this job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will oversee the production of more pilots in the next 120
days than I have for the entire 3.5 years I've been at Comedy
Central,'' he said. ``The question for me is will the things I've
been able to do successfully on the cable end, will they translate?
That's really the million-dollar question.''
</P>
<P>
   What Herzog has been able to do on the cable end is, though on a
smaller scale, the same thing Fox wants him to do: establish
successful regular series.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Herzog remembered clearly the precise moment his career as a
programmer started. He had joined MTV in 1984, while that was still
a nascent channel, looking to put down firm roots. His position was
news director, which reflected a bit of his background. He had
started as an intern at CNN, though he admitted, ``I hated hard
news.'' His interest really was entertainment news; he had started
such a show at CNN before leaving to work a short stint as a
producer on the syndicated series ``Entertainment Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like with what I did at CNN and `Entertainment Tonight'
and then MTV, I helped develop that infotainment show-biz news
thing,'' Herzog said. ``Though I'm not all that proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his early work at MTV he helped establish some news inserts
amid what was then a regular format of music videos. At some of the
regular meetings of the channel's executives, Herzog said he
agitated for ``doing something more than just videos.'' Those
requests were ignored until one day when MTV's first president,
Robert Pittmann, called a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well we've got to do some shows,'' Herzog said, doing a
better-than-passable imitation of Pittmann's nasal delivery. ``We
need some show to get the ratings up. So, Herzog, I need some shows
on the air in six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   As there was so little time to work with, the goals had to be
modest. Herzog thought of a game show. It turned out to be ``Remote
Control,'' one of the early breakthrough series for the channel.
``All at once I'm a programmer,'' Herzog said.
</P>
<P>
   Other shows followed: ``The Video Music Awards,'' ``The Movie
Awards,'' ``Real World,'' ``Unplugged.'' MTV, which had been almost
exclusively a ``lifestyle'' channel, defined by its emphasis on
music and music culture, suddenly had regular series with regular
audiences and regular advertising sales.
</P>
<P>
   At MTV, Herzog gained a reputation as both an innovative
programmer and a solid business executive. Both qualities helped
land him the job at Comedy Central, a channel whose lack of
signature programming was matched by its lack of identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought he was crazy to go to Comedy
Central,'' said one of his executive colleagues at MTV, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``The channel was a joke, but nothing on
it was funny. It seemed like a waste of his talents.''
</P>
<P>
   But Herzog saw it an an opportunity. In cable, even small
improvements can pay off in big ways. Through some skillful
acquisitions like the British comedy ``Absolutely Fabulous'' and
some attention-getting original programs like ``Politically
Incorrect,'' Herzog made some quick impact at Comedy Central.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``South Park,'' an irreverent, vulgar, often hilarious
cartoon from two recent college graduates in Colorado, and both
Comedy Central and Doug Herzog were hot commodities in the
television business.
</P>
<P>
   This fall he got an exploratory call from a Fox executive, to
which he reacted with what he called ``shock and denial.'' He had
no plans to leave Comedy Central. ``I was having success there and
had reason to think I would continue to have success.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other negatives, there was his personal situation, a happy
New York lifestyle for him, his wife and three young children.
Having grown up in Paterson, N.J., (where he was one of the few
Jewish graduates of Paterson Regional Catholic High School, which
he attended because of the less than inspiring state of the public
schools there at the time), Herzog was totally uninterested in a
job that would require him to move to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, there was that other little negative about network
television: ``It meant joining a network,'' he said. ``It's a dying
business. Why would I do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the reconsideration. ``It's still one of the premier
jobs in television, albeit not what it was when Brandon Tartikoff
was programming NBC. Still, at the end of the day you're in every
home. The networks still have an enormous advantage. They've just
got to figure a way to get more people into the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox was appealing, he said, because it meant joining more than
just a network. ``NBC and CBS are in the network business,'' Herzog
said. ``Fox is in the television business.'' With its own studio,
its cable networks, its global reach, ``I was getting into the
vertically integrated television business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And now that he has joined them, what does Herzog think he can
do to stave off the march toward extinction for the networks?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I bring is an environment where risk-taking is
really encouraged,'' he said. ``My experience at places like MTV
and Comedy Central will be helpful in terms of risk taking: Where
can you go and how far can you go? That's a skill I'm going to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I come without the traditional point of view in terms
of developing programs, and ultimately that's where the rubber
meets the road. You can say what you want, but it's a business of
hits. If I can come up with some hit shows for these guys it's
going to work out great. And if I can't, it probably won't.''

THIS HOLIDAY, TRY WELCOMING FLAVORS OF THAILAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to government estimates, 95 percent of Thai residents
are Buddhists. Most of the others are Muslim. Yet if you walk into
a Bangkok tourist hotel this month you are liable to hear ``I Saw
Mommy Kissing Santa Claus'' being played over the sound system.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai love tourists. But these days, due to the financial
collapse of Asian markets, there are not nearly enough tourists to
go around.
</P>
<P>
   Patronize a restaurant in the Montien Riverside Hotel and you
will notice as you are seated at an outdoor table on the bank of
the Chao Phraya that you are surrounded by tuxedoed waiters.
</P>
<P>
   The food is excellent, dishes cost as little as $4, and you are
treated to an unexpected fireworks show (part of a birthday
celebration for the 71-year-old monarch, aka Rama IX). Yet the
restaurant is almost deserted.
</P>
<P>
   At the Oriental _ acclaimed as the finest hotel in Asia _ an
excellent jazz combo performs in a terrace bar. But there is a
musician for almost every patron in the place.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to lure more tourists, prices on package tours to
Bangkok are unbelievably low. Upon arriving, tourists learn that a
cab ride will usually cost less than $3. And they can order crispy
noodles, chicken satay, hot-and-sour prawn soup, sauteed shrimp
with asparagus and mushrooms, roast duck curry, marinated chicken
wrapped in papadan leaves and jasmine rice for 300 baht (about $8)
per person at the Ban Chiang restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Nareerat Srisawat is an executive for the Bangkok's Montien
hotels. She still owns a residence in Kent, Wash., and occasionally
returns to visit the friends she once treated to home-cooked Thai
feasts. Srisawat and her husband moved to Bangkok when Thai
Airlines moved its West Coast headquarters from Seattle to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   She still maintains an avid interest in Seattle and in spreading
the gospel of Thai cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   And what do the Thais eat during that season of the year when
Mommy might be seen kissing Santa Claus?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we don't have turkey at holiday,'' confesses one of
Srisawat's friends, a Bangkok tour guide known as Toy. ``I bring
home Kentucky Fried Chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Which probably means that in Seattle, we should serve Thai
chicken during the holiday season. This is a variation, using
ingredients readily available in local markets.
</P>
<P>
   Thai Chicken
</P>
<P>
   2 whole chicken breasts
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons soy sauce (divided)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cornstarch (divided)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons oil
</P>
<P>
   { cup peanuts (salted or unsalted)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon (or more) crushed red peppers
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon minced ginger root
</P>
<P>
   { cup chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   { pound snow peas
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   Skin and bone the chicken breasts and slice the meat into
strips. Mix together 3 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of
cornstarch and moosh the chicken strips in this mess. Let
everything sit for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the red bell pepper in half, discard the seeds and cut into
strips.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a tablespoon of oil in a hot skillet or wok and quickly fry
the peanuts and dried red peppers. After you have sneezed twice,
remove from the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the pan and stir-fry
the chicken and ginger until the meat is slightly browned. Add the
broth, vinegar, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, the wine and sugar. Mix
this around once or twice, cover the pan and simmer 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the red pepper strips and pea pods and stir-cook another 2
minutes. Mix the remaining tablespoon of cornstarch with 2
tablespoons of water, mix in and cook until everything thickens
slightly. Add the peanut mixture and stir again.
</P>
<P>
   This should serve four to six, with rice.
</P>
<P>
   Phad Thai
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons cooking oil
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces sen lek noodles (flat, dry, rice noodles)
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons roasted peanuts (divided)
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons dried shrimp, pounded into powder (divided)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped preserved turnip
</P>
<P>
   1 cup bean sprouts (divided)
</P>
<P>
   4 green onions cut in 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   Chopped cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   Soak the noodles in water for 20 minutes or until soft. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   In a wok or skillet, heat the oil to medium-high and add the
garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Break the eggs into the pan, stir and cook for 5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Add noodles and stir-cook 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Add, in order, the lemon juice, fish sauce, sugar, half the
peanuts, half the dried shrimp, chili powder, preserved turnip,
half the bean sprouts and the green onions.
</P>
<P>
   Stir-cook a few seconds until the noodles are done, then scoop
onto a platter and add the remaining peanuts, dried shrimp and bean
sprouts. Scatter cilantro leaves over the top. This should serve
four.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to add chicken cubes or thin beef slices to your
phad thai, cook them in the pan with the garlic and, when done, add
the noodles and other ingredients.

ESCAPISM AND EMOTIONAL RISK IN `THE SIMPSONS,' `BABE` FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Politics has made the spectacle of human behavior very
distasteful in recent days, and though none of it should be
ignored, some of it must be put at a distance for at least some of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   So I have sought escape in the world of animal fables and
animation, gazing at old MGM and Warner Brothers cartoons on cable
television, following nightly episodes of ``The Simpsons,''
watching ``Babe'' on video and then going to the theater to see the
sequel, ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' where I sat across the aisle
from a small boy who cried ``Ouch! Ouch!'' every time something
painful or frightening happened.
</P>
<P>
   There is no pain that can't be turned to pleasure in those old
cartoons where pigs, rabbits, ducks, crows and foxes have at one
another with no pretense of motive beyond natural law, cheerful
spite and the love of trickery.
</P>
<P>
   Writing about Walt Disney in 1934, the art critic Erwin Panofsky
said that cartoons had all the elements of folklore _ ``sadism,
pornography, the humor engendered by both, and moral justice'' _
which they turned into variations on the David and Goliath theme,
``the triumph of the seemingly weak over the seemingly strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite cathartic in their way, and exactly the principles at work
in full-length animation spectacles like ``Antz'' and ``A Bug's
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Things often get kinder, gentler and duller when humans enter
the picture. But one of the pleasures of ``The Simpsons,'' and
clearly one of the reasons the show gets away with its
blithe-spirit satire of American life, is the fact that the family
members look as though someone combined the physical traits of
several species, primate and otherwise, to make them.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoons wouldn't exist without caricature and expressionism,
but those qualities are usually matched by the extreme situations
the characters trip, stumble, swagger and fall into. That's not
true here. We are in the land of ``It's a Wonderful Life''; but
there is no angel to intervene, and nothing has turned out the way
Frank Capra planned.
</P>
<P>
   Where else in television sitcoms post Archie Bunker and Roseanne
will you find such jaunty acknowledgment of greed, sloth, earnest
ineptitude and cheerful selfishness among family and friends in the
workplace, the schools and the home? Along with good intentions,
reconciliations and (for a little while at least) cheerful endings.
Why not? Life can supply these, too, and comedy demands them.
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Simpsons'' was first broadcast in 1989, it was fun to
say that the smartest, cheekiest sitcom on television was a
cartoon. Now it's pretty depressing.
</P>
<P>
   In short-range terms, I'd love to see what the show would do
with the forthcoming Senate impeachment trial. Long range, I'd like
to see what would happen if a television show that starred actual
rather than animated human beings risked doing what ``The
Simpsons'' already does.
</P>
<P>
   I'm almost embarrassed to say how much I liked the ``Babe''
movies, with their fusion of real people, real animals, animatronic
animal doubles and animation. And I'm appalled that ``Babe: Pig in
the City'' is a failure at the box office in part because adults
seem to think it is too dark for their children. Is it any darker
than ``Bambi'' or ``Dumbo''?
</P>
<P>
   If adults don't want to go with children, then they ought to go
themselves. I did. ``The Simpsons'' invites grown-ups to talk about
satire; ``Babe'' and ``Babe: Pig in the City'' are fables that make
us talk about sentiment and morality.
</P>
<P>
   When Paramount first made cartoons based on ``Aesop's Fables''
in the 1920s, five animals arranged themselves around a logo that
read ``sugar-coated pills of wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all their pills of wisdom, their declarations about the
virtues of an unprejudiced heart, of courage and loyalty, their
praise of how a pig _ that most low-caste of animals _ sought
identity, community and love in the world of animals and humans,
the ``Babe'' movies tap real emotion, not just sentiment. They are
filled with stories about power, pride and prejudice, both inter-
and intra-species. The city that Babe must travel to in order to
help save his beloved Farmer Hoggett's land is a place of shysters,
lowlife entertainers, thugs and beggars.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the animals. The humans are even more
threatening and considerably more shallow, especially those who
fail to acknowledge that they are bound to animals by respect as
well as by need or greed. (Is there a political fable tucked in
here somewhere? Yes, as a matter of fact. Both movies are
anti-colonialist, more subtly but just as surely as Orwell's
``Animal Farm'' is anti-totalitarian.)
</P>
<P>
   I haven't read the Dick King-Smith book that inspired ``Babe,''
but I can say that as movies the ``Babes'' have a leisurely
expansiveness and a way of framing episodes that comes from novels.
You will think of E.B. White; of both ``Charlotte's Web'' and
``Stuart Little.''
</P>
<P>
   But you will think of Dickens, too, in some of the darker city
scenes, where cruelty, innocence and caricature push up against one
another with real violence.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, children, along with dissenting or disenfranchised
adults, love animal fables. When you cannot make yourself
understood by people with power over you, you might as well belong
to another species. Their laws and pronouncements make little or no
sense to you, but unless you can outwit them, you must obey.
</P>
<P>
   Can you blame the boy across the aisle from me for screaming
``Ouch!''?

DREAMWORKS LEARNS IT IS NOT EASY TO OUT-DISNEY DISNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was to be the film in which the Dreamworks SKG partner
Jeffrey Katzenberg would step out of Michael Eisner's shadow _ an
animated story with a huge box office, just like ``The Lion King''
and other hand-drawn hits that Katzenberg helped oversee before his
bitter split with Eisner and Walt Disney Co. several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But this film, ``The Prince of Egypt,'' was also to be something
more: a movie with a serious theme that audiences would recognize
as raising the art of mass-market animation to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while the Christmas weekend ticket sales should please
Katzenberg _ the animated story of Moses has held up at the box
office in the face of intense competition from holiday films _ many
people in Hollywood say that two weeks after its release, the movie
is not showing signs of becoming a megahit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early,'' said an executive with a major theater
exhibitor, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But `Prince of
Egypt' didn't do the kind of opening that forecasts a $100 million
film.''
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million benchmark is significant, because industry
estimates place the film's cost between $75 million and $100
million. And Dreamworks is widely thought to have spent as much as
$50 million to promote it.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it was a matter of misjudging the public's appetite
for a serious animated film during the holiday season or simply
running into heavy competition that may be fragmenting the
audience, or perhaps even exposing new fault lines in the animation
market, Katzenberg and Dreamworks have found that it is not easy to
out-Disney Disney.
</P>
<P>
   After opening on Dec. 18 and averaging $4,496 a screen, or $14.5
million in its first weekend, by Sunday afternoon executives of
Dreamworks were forecasting $15.3 million for its second weekend, a
number that several top- level industry executives at other studios
said they found overly optimistic. Using the Dreamworks numbers,
that brings the total to $40.2 million since the movie opened.
</P>
<P>
   And an executive close to Dreamworks who requested anonymity
said he was convinced the film would gross more than $100 million.
Others put the final figure at $80 million to $90 million in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although the film is clearly a critical success, the latter
figures would not seem to put it on track for the kind of financial
success of two lighter-hearted holiday-season animated offerings.
Viacom's ``The Rugrats Movie,'' which opened at $10,065 a screen
and grossed $76.8 million after four weeks, cost a mere $25 million
to make. Meanwhile, Disney's ``A Bug's Life,'' which opened at
$12,360 a screen and has taken in nearly $100 million for the same
period, is the biggest hit of the group and cost about $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though movie studios keep only about half of the box office
gross, once a film reaches a critical level, movie company
executives can project how much a film will reap from sales in
cable, videocassettes and other markets. If they know the film's
cost and marketing expenses, they can use those projections to
estimate when it will reach profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Because Dreamworks has kept its costs a well-guarded secret, it
is hard to gauge how much money ``Prince of Egypt'' would make if
it did $85 million at the U.S. box office.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg, the executive producer of ``The Prince of Egypt,''
reached by telephone Sunday in Hawaii, where he was vacationing,
declined to comment. The movie is not the first animated film from
Dreamworks, a company founded with much fanfare in 1994 as a
partnership of Katzenberg, the record-industry magnate David Geffen
and the filmmaker Steven Spielberg. In early October, Dreamworks
released ``Antz,'' a computer-animation movie similar in look and
theme to ``A Bug's Life,'' but like ``Prince of Eqypt'' aimed
somewhat above the kiddie crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz,'' which cost an estimated $42 million and at the time of
its release had the animation field to itself, opened to a
respectable $7,020 a screen. The film has long since broken into
the black, grossing $87.9 million as of last weekend, and is likely
to turn a good rofit.
</P>
<P>
   But for Dreamworks, there is perhaps much more riding on
``Prince of Eqypt,'' a film aimed at Disney's forte _ hand-drawn
animation. The effort devoted to making and marketing the movie
indicate that Katzenberg's motivations in building an animation
division are based on much more than an ego battle with Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animation is the source of money that will make Dreamworks
work,'' an executive at a rival studio said in an interview earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the profit margins for animated films are
generally much higher than for live-action movies. Not only do
animated films often generate sales of related products, but they
do not depend on costly stars who take either a big share of the
upfront money or a percentage of the box office _ or both. The
absence of stars also means that the budgets for sequels are not
burdened by the demands of ambitious actors in search of ever
higher payouts.
</P>
<P>
   As Katzenberg well knows, it is a business model that his former
employer, Disney, has pursued long and profitably.
</P>
<P>
   David Londoner, a media analyst at Schroder and Co., explained
the math this way: ``If Disney invests $10 in a live action film,
they are lucky if they can return $12 or $13 that they can keep.
For an animated film, they expect to keep at least $25 on a $10
investment. In both cases, the return includes profits from
soundtracks, videocassettes and merchandising.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of animated films aimed at children, of course,
merchandising often means tie-ins with retailers who are eager to
turn a movie's anticipated popularity into an occasion to sell more
of their own products. And the cross-promotion can feed back into
the popularity of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo PLC's Burger King, for example, has spent an estimated
$25 million to promote ``Rugrats.'' And McDonald's had a similar
promotion for ``A Bug's Life,'' which one Disney executive said was
worth about $30 million in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Dreamworks did not forge any McMoses Fun Meal-type links for
``The Prince of Egypt.'' (Industry accounts vary about whether this
was because Dreamworks did not want to seem to cheapen a biblical
theme, or because the fast-food chains had qualms of their own.)
The sole merchandising tie-in is a deal with Wal-Mart Stores, which
is selling copies of the film's soundtrack that include two coupons
redeemable for a movie ticket.
</P>
<P>
   A Dreamworks executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said
that 1.6 million of these packages were produced for Wal-Mart, and
that only 20 percent have been cashed in, assuring box office
demand from the remaining tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Press, the Dreamworks marketing chief, said the studio had
been tweaking its advertising strategy to bring in more families
and children, after an opening weekend in which a full 49 percent
of those attending ``The Prince of Egypt'' were adults not
accompanied by children. ``I have shifted things to be more
family-targeted, because we already bring in the adults,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the opening weekend, for example, newspaper ads for the
movie evoked a museum poster _ an iconic silhouette of the Moses
character, inset with a far-off view of the Great Pyramids. This
past weekend, the movie ads evoked a superheroes cartoon, depicting
a chariot drag race between a youthful, bare-chested Moses and the
youthful, bare-chested Pharaoh-in-waiting, Rameses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Press disputed industry estimates that Dreamworks had spent
$50 million promoting the film, saying the true figure was closer
to $30 million. She blamed the discrepancy on the fact that most
industry analysts are based in either New York or Los Angeles and
tend _ incorrectly, she argued _ to extrapolate estimated
expenditures in those cities to the rest of the country. ``We spend
more in those markets because we are trying to impress the
industry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in this battle of animated holiday films, paid
advertising has been more crucial to Dreamworks than to Disney or
Viacom, which can both rely on the so-called synergies of
cross-media ownership.
</P>
<P>
   To coincide with the release of ``A Bug's Life,'' for example,
Disney produced a half-hour syndicated television program about the
making of the film. The program was carried on ABC's own stations
and on many ABC affiliates. And The Disney Channel, a cable
service, has been running ``Prince of Egypt'' promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom took an even more direct line of attack with ``Rugrats.''
Viacom's Paramount film studio produced the movie, which is based
on the animated series that appears on Viacom's Nickelodeon cable
channel. For months, a promotion for the film has appeared at the
end of every ``Rugrats'' television episode. And in the final week
before the ``Rugrats'' opening, Viacom pre-empted the show each
evening, replacing it with an episode of the cartoon series ``Hey,
Arnold!'' with an on-screen notice that ``The Rugrats have gone to
Hollywood!''
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks, strictly a film and television studio and music
company, has few opportunities for such promotional synergies.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the eventual box-office, overseas and video-release
revenue from ``The Prince of Egypt,'' Dreamworks will presumably
remain intent on pursuing the lucrative potential of the animation
business. The company will release ``El Dorado'' in about a year
and ``Chicken Run'' after that.
</P>
<P>
   But Katzenberg's experience with this initial attempt to outdo
Disney has proved instructive.

   HOLIDAY-SPENDING _ Largely undistracted by the impeachment of
President Clinton and the bombing of Iraq, U.S. shoppers appear to
have spent freely from wallets that still feel pretty fat, giving

SCIENTISTS STUDY POPULATION DECLINE OF ENDANGERED SEA OTTERS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Southern sea otters, the playful darlings of the
central California coast, appear to be diminishing in number at a
rate that perplexes and worries scientists.
</P>
<P>
   A twice-yearly survey released recently by the biological
resources division of the U.S. Geological Survey showed 1,937
otters along the 300 miles of coast. This fall's count represents a
12 percent decrease since the fall of 1997, and the fewest otters
since a record high of 2,377 in the spring of 1995. The otter
census has been conducted every May and November since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in Monterey, Calif., the epicenter of sea otter
studies in California, fear that the decline may signal a new
danger for the health of the species, which was hunted almost to
extinction in the 18th and 19th centuries by fur hunters who sought
their luxurious pelts. Early in this century a small colony of
otters was discovered in the Big Sur area south of Monterey. The
current population grew from that colony.
</P>
<P>
   Otter experts are not sure what the drop in numbers means for
the health of the species, now and in the future. The only
certainty is that if subsequent counts drop below 1,850, the
otters' designation on the Endangered Species List would shift from
threatened to endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Johnson, manager of the sea otter rescue and conservation
program at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, said it would be
premature to attribute the population drop to any one factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't yet have any really solid clues as to what's behind
these lower counts,'' Johnson said, adding that the change could be
part of a natural cycle.
</P>
<P>
   But pollution and disease are prime suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking closely at what might be getting into the food
system, getting ingested and winding up in the tissue of the
otters,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The sea otter, a top predator in the near-shore ecosystem, often
swims on its back and in this position eats its meals of abalone,
crabs and sea urchins, sometimes using a rock to smash open the
shells.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its high metabolic rate, necessary to keep it warm in
the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, the otter eats from a quarter
to a third of its body weight every day. Adults weigh 10 to 25
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 40 percent of dead otters _ most found washed ashore _ had
some type of infection or parasite, and some have contained
chemical contaminants like PCBs and DDT.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is that we are doing something to the near-shore
ecosystem,'' Johnson said, ``or that some immune suppression is
making them more susceptible to infectious diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the Monterey Bay Aquarium, at the offices of
Friends of the Sea Otter, an advocacy group, its science director,
Jim Curland, echoed Johnson's worries about the otters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sea otter population is clearly in decline and we have to
do something to reverse the trend,'' Curland said. ``Something is
not right in the waters, and there needs to be more research and
lots more funding for that research.''
</P>
<P>
   Curland likened the plight of the sea otter to that of the
California condor, which was near extinction before a program was
established to breed the birds in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, northern sea otters _ larger cousins of the southern
sea otters _ are also declining. Since 1990, as many as 45,000
North Pacific sea otters have been eaten by killer whales. As the
number of harbor seals and sea lions have declined in Alaskan
waters, the whales have shifted their feeding from the open ocean
to coastal areas where the otters live and feed.

UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO COMES TO A FORK IN THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Ever since its creation on the South Side of Chicago
in 1892 with a pile of Rockefeller money and a group of top-flight
scholars, no academic institution has exemplified intellectual
seriousness quite like the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   More Nobel Prizes _ 70 _ have been awarded to professors and
students here than at any other university; its faculty famously
declined to grant Queen Elizabeth an honorary degree, because of
her lack of scholarly credentials; its undergraduates take two full
years of prescribed core courses, including calculus and physics
and a tough set of humanities and social-science classes.
</P>
<P>
   But with today's increasingly common view of colleges as
employment-credentialing stations, students as customers, and
learning for its own sake as a quaint idea whose time has passed,
the University of Chicago is in the midst of a painful identity
crisis, closely watched by educators across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to make the university more attractive to high school
seniors, to make it seem less of a grind, it is reducing its core
curriculum and increasing its recreation and service facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many students we can attract if we go after
those who only seek the life of the mind,'' asserted Michael
Behnke, a new vice president hired to improve marketing and
recruitment. ``Kids aren't sure they can lead a balanced life here.
My job is to convince them that they are not joining a monastery.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are fighting words to some at Chicago who consider the
university's cloistered approach to learning and its insistence on
a tough common core to be its sources of pride and mission in a
world of increasingly instant gratification.
</P>
<P>
   Many colleges have gone through versions of this debate at
different times. In the late 1960s, a number of colleges greatly
reduced their core curriculums to make room for less traditional
courses and more individual tailoring. Brown University, which has
no core requirements, is among the best-known examples. Columbia
University, by contrast, has a fairly heavy load of core courses.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago, where Robert Maynard Hutchins reinvented
undergraduate education in the 1940s, likes to think of itself as
marching to its own proven drummer rather than shifting to
accommodate changing fashions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why change Chicago's academic fabric, its uniqueness, which is
its appeal, and make it like any other institution?'' said Bradley
Henderson, 19, a second-year student from Cincinnati who plans to
focus on English and international relations. ``Why not market
that, accentuate that? They're putting their emphasis on issues on
which we can't compete.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that applications and endowments may be
skyrocketing at ``hot'' universities like Brown and Duke, but
Chicago is facing few applicants, a relatively high dropout and
transfer rate and a crumbling physical infrastructure crying out
for big expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   In the hope of improving its finances through tuition payments
now and alumni giving in years ahead, Chicago is increasing its
undergraduate population by 1,000 students, to 4,500, over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who consider Chicago's size and curriculum to be
appropriate say they worry about the kind of college the changes
will make it.
</P>
<P>
   Bertram Cohler, a professor of psychology and education, put it
this way: ``This is a dirty, intense place in a grubby city. You
can only smooth some of its rough edges. Of course we want some
students who will join the Junior League, but also those who don't
shave, have bloodshot eyes and read Kierkegaard at 3 in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody at the university opposes reading Kierkegaard at 3 in the
morning. Even its most ardent reform advocates say they are seeking
to ensure Chicago a long and healthy future, to preserve, not
destroy, its rigor and unique intellectual environment. But to do
so, they say, requires change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curriculum design at Chicago is a contact sport and that is
just as it should be,'' observed Hugo Sonnenschein, the
university's president for the last five years. He is a former
Princeton provost accused by traditionalists here of failing to
understand Chicago's history and character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago has a special role and responsibility because it has a
reputation as embodying what a great university should be,'' he
added. ``But the commodification and marketing of higher education
are unmistakable today and we can't jolly dance along and not pay
attention to them. One hears constantly from parents and students:
`We are the consumer. We pay the tuition.'''
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the student body and the trimming of the common
core are emotionally charged issues because they are seen to strike
at the heart of the university's mission.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing common core includes eight quarters of science and
math, seven of humanities and civilization, three of social
sciences and three of a foreign language, for a total of 21
courses. This means that the curriculum of a student's first two
years is essentially predetermined. Some professors and
administrators urged cutting that number to nine to make room for
more electives and to better focus on students' majors.
</P>
<P>
   After a bruising debate, the reduction, to go into effect next
September, is relatively minor _ down to 15 or 18 courses,
depending on how the foreign-language requirement gets worked out.
The change will mean that instead of accounting for half of a
student's course work, the core will take up a third.
</P>
<P>
   This, according to John Boyer, dean of the college, will allow
time for study abroad, something Chicago has never advocated in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have the notion that there was no greater
educational experience than to be on the Chicago campus,'' Boyer
said. ``Now, we are hoping to get one-third to one-half of those
graduating to be fluent in a foreign language by urging them to
spend time abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Leora Auslander, a professor of history and director of the new
Center for Gender Studies, said she would like the core to have
been cut further so that students would have a chance to examine
new fields of inquiry, like gender studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no danger of the University of Chicago becoming less
demanding,'' Dr. Auslander said of the notion that reducing the
core curriculum meant less rigor. ``The danger I worry about is it
becoming an anachronism.''
</P>
<P>
   She said students wanted and should be permitted to make more of
their own curricular choices and decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's new marketers, like Behnke, the vice president in
charge of enrollment, agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a culture of choice, of doing your own thing,''
Behnke said.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Sonnenschein said he had instituted a number of other changes to
make Chicago more in keeping with students' and parents'
expectations. He gave as an example his push to improve
career-placement services. Until recently, he said, the office was
pitifully inactive, an approach that he said was like ``sticking a
finger in the eye'' of parents paying thousands yearly for their
children's education and worrying about their professional futures.
</P>
<P>
   He has also committed $35 million to the building of a new
swimming pool and sports center and has renovated the student
center, increased the number of student clubs and hired two
associate deans for student activities and volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most worrisome statistics, he and others say, is the
low number of children of alumni who choose Chicago. At 5 percent,
it is well below the 10 percent to 20 percent at the top Ivy League
colleges. Surveys show that alumni view their experience here as
having been so intensely academic that they are uncertain if their
children would be happy here.
</P>
<P>
   The problem becomes manifest in the low number of applicants
Chicago attracts _ 5,500 last year, compared with 17,000 at
Stanford and 13,000 at Princeton. It is true that Chicago's
applicants are a self-selected group with a keen interest in
intellectual pursuit. But given that Chicago's faculty is among the
top four or five in the nation, the low numbers are unsettling to
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers mean that Chicago's applicant acceptance rate _ more
than 60 percent _ is far above those of the institutions with which
it is typically grouped. Harvard's is 13 percent, Yale's 21 percent
and Cornell's 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has an equally vexing problem of failing to retain its
students at the rate of comparable institutions. Throughout the Ivy
League, the percentage of entering freshmen who graduate is well
above 90 percent _ 97 percent at Harvard, for example, and 96
percent at Yale. At Chicago, it is 83 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Schildkraut, 19, of Newton, Mass., is an example of the
kind of bright, focused student at Chicago who thinks he would be
happier elsewhere and is planning to transfer. Schildkraut said
that Chicago had many wonderful qualities but that he wanted
greater curricular freedom than he had here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In looking for a college to transfer to,'' he said, ``one
thing I am most interested in is finding a place where I can play
the primary role in designing my own curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a sentiment that has the Chicago faculty divided, partly
along generational lines. Many older professors insist that the
curricular common core is vital, that without it a culture can
disintegrate and fragment into individuals who cannot communicate
with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Younger instructors, by contrast, would rather focus on their
specialized areas and not have to teach so much in the core. They
also tend to consider the notion of a common grounding in a set of
European books or ideas to no longer be so important.
</P>
<P>
   Constantin Fasolt, a professor of history at Chicago who has
favored a reduced core curriculum, offers the perspective of his
German upbringing to defend the change.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a student in Germany, he said, nine years of Latin
and four of Greek were the bare minimum required for any serious
scholar of the humanities. When he came to the United States 20
years ago, he found many first-rate scholars who had neither one.
Rigid core curriculums have made him suspicious ever since. He
acknowledges that drawing the line is complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The verdict of what we are doing will come in 20 to 30
years,'' he said. ``Either they will say that this is when Chicago
started going downhill or when it started to come together, when
people started paying attention to it once again as the leader in
undergraduate education.''
</P>

   Kurt White, 21, a fourth-year student from Birmingham, Mich.,
says he fears he knows what that verdict will be.

   ``It may be harder to get into Harvard, but it's harder to get
out of here and I'm proud of that,'' White said. ``This is one of
the very last places that has a rigorous curriculum. It's a test
case. If you lose Chicago, I don't know what you'll have left.''

ITALIAN TELEVISION SHOWS IMPORT A CALIFORNIAN LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)  (ms) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ When Heather Parisi fainted at the end of a dance number
on a popular Italian variety show, it was reported on the front
pages of Italy's leading newspapers. Wendy Windham, a blonde and
buxom sidekick on yet another popular variety show, was mobbed by
paparazzi as she went Christmas shopping in the Piazza Navona.
Justine Mattera, who does a pale impersonation of Marilyn Monroe on
a talk show, is a household name in Italy. So is Randi Ingerman,
who recently got her own sitcom, ``Men Are All Alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, in Italy it is the American women on television who
have a lot in common. Like almost every other country in the world
except perhaps Myanmar, Italy imports a large number of U.S.
television shows, from sitcoms and soap operas, to ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   But Italian television's fondness for Americana goes a bit
further than most. Almost every variety show _ and there are dozens
_ features what Italians call a ``soubrette,'' borrowing an old
French term for a nubile maid in a theatrical comedy. On Italian
television, the ideal soubrette does not necessarily sing or dance,
but she is almost always tall, blonde and Californian, and speaks
adorably fractured Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want me to speak Italian well,'' Ms. Windham said,
explaining her job description on ``I Cervelloni,'' a popular
variety show centered around inventors and their gadgets. The other
requirements are that she wear sparkling gowns with slits and
plunging decollete, and smile while the host, Giancarlo Magalli _
who is plump, balding and a full head shorter than she _ leers up
at her figure and mocks the way she talks.
</P>
<P>
   American accents are funny to Italians. But Italian audiences
also seem to delight in the pairing of tiny balding men with
towering blonde women _ ``Regis and Kathy Lee'' as seen by Fellini.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Beauty and the Beast _ the fantasy that even the monster
can have the beauty,'' explained Gianluca Nicoletti, a radio talk
show host and television critic. ``On Italian television, you never
have handsome men, its short ugly guys and big, beautiful dumb
women.''
</P>
<P>
   But some sociologists also see deeper reasons rooted in the
Italian fascination with American culture _ as well as tiny pangs
of subconscious resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We no longer look to the United States for economic help or
political direction,'' said Franco Ferrarotti, a well-known Italian
sociologist. ``Now we are fixated on America for its youth.
Europeans, and especially Italians, perceive themselves as old. And
we are old _ 60 percent of us are retirement age. We have a new
cultural ideal, which is a youthful, healthy looking American
girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrarotti, whose own wife is American, added, ``She should be
beautiful, blonde, and have an obvious handicap, like she can't
speak the language. That allows us to be patronizing _ this perfect
girl needs our help.''
</P>
<P>
   Offstage, Ms. Windham, 31, a Californian who has lived in Italy
for nine years, speaks fluent Italian and sometimes has difficulty
recalling English (``How do you say in English, `furba?' '' she
asked midsentence. It means clever.) On television, however, she is
not supposed to seem furba.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want me to talk,'' she said. ``One time we had
Australian inventors on the show and instead of letting me
interpret, they used instantaneous translators.'' Ms. Windham shook
her head forlornly. ``That made me mad.''
</P>
<P>
   But she readily admitted that she has a career and celebrity in
Italy that she could never hope to duplicate at home. So did Carol
Alt, 38, a tall, blue-eyed former supermodel who has starred in
several Italian mini-series and now, with the help of dubbing,
plays a heart specialist on ``Under the African Sky,'' a new
Italian television drama _ perhaps an exception to the dumb beauty
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to work at home, for sure,'' Miss Alt said. ``But I
am very happy with what has happened for me here.'' Asked why she
and other Americans were so popular in Italy, Miss Alt replied, ``I
think Italians find foreigners _ how do you say? _ affascinante,
exciting and different.''
</P>
<P>
   That may well explain the sudden popularity of Lisa Molten, a
member of an international chorus of ``soubrettes'' on the game
show ``The Wolf's Mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Audience members select the woman they want to spin the wheel,
and Ms. Molton, 20, is picked so often that each time, the host,
Carlo Conti, ritually sighs, ``Lisa again?'' Ms. Molton, 20, a
ballet dancer from Easthampton, Mass., arrived in Italy only three
months ago and was cast as soon as she opened her mouth and failed
to say anything correctly except ``pasta.''
</P>
<P>
   The balding and bespectacled host enjoys mocking her American
accent, echoing the American-accented, Italian dubbed voice of Stan
Laurel in the old Laurel and Hardy movies, which, known as
``Stanlio e Ollio'' are still popular in Italy. That inside joke is
lost on Miss Molton. ``They are always imitating the way I say
``non capito,''' she said. ``I think it has something to do with
two characters in Italian history.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parisi, 38, a dancer who has performed on Italian TV shows
for 20 years, was discovered in a Roman discotheque. Last month she
riveted her fans when she fainted on ``Caramba, Che Fortune,''
while performing a vampy pas de deux. (She later explained a doctor
had given her a overdose of painkiller for a strained leg muscle.)
</P>
<P>
   Italians love her dancing, but she is just as famous for her
brash blonde American image _ and pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   To some, this is a uniquely Italian phenomenon. ``These shows
reveal a mix of unconscious rascality and also self-mockery,''
explained Giuliano Ferrara, the editor of the Rome daily Il Foglio.
``We really don't take ourselves seriously.'' Ferrara, who is
married to a tall blonde Californian, added, ``it's a playful
fantasy that even men like us can get get a tall, beautiful
American girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Why so many shows cater to male fantasies even though the
audiences for them are predominately female, is a mystery that does
not baffle Daniela Cannizzaro, the cultural critic for Italy's
feminist magazine, Noi Donne. ``Women may dominate viewer
audiences,'' Ms. Cannizzaro said wearily. ``But men still make the
TV shows.''

SHARP DROP IN VIOLENT CRIME TRACED TO DECLINE IN CRACK MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New statistics released Sunday by the Justice Department are
helping criminologists resolve a contentious mystery _ why violent
crime has dropped seven straight years after an upsurge in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics, showing that robbery fell a stunning 17 percent
in 1997, suggest that while there are many factors behind the
decline in crime in the 1990s, the crucial ones may be the
withering away of the crack market and police efforts to seize
handguns from criminals and juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   The two crimes that have fallen the most sharply since 1991 are
homicide and now robbery, the two most often committed with
handguns and most associated with the crack cocaine epidemic in the
late 1980s, criminologists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homicide and robbery were the two crimes most impacted by
crack markets, with the biggest increases, and now as crack markets
have declined, homicide and robbery have led the way down,'' said
James Alan Fox, dean of the college of criminal justice at
Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   The figures on robbery were released Sunday by the Bureau of
Justice Statistics, a branch of the Justice Department, as part of
its National Crime Victimization Survey. The annual survey, carried
out for the Justice Department by the Census Bureau, asks 80,000
people ages 12 and older whether they have been victims of a crime
in the past year. It complements the other major national set of
crime statistics, the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, which measures
crimes reported to police.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Justice Department said, both violent and property
crimes have fallen to their lowest levels since 1973, when the
victimization survey was started. In fact, the rate of property
crime _ which includes burglary, theft and motor vehicle theft _
has fallen by more than half, to 248 per 1,000 households in 1997,
down from 555 per 1,000 households in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Property crime, unlike violent crime, has been dropping steadily
since 1975. Among the reasons, experts say, are the aging of the
baby boom population beyond its prime years for committing crime,
the increased use of security alarms and the switch of many
criminals from burglary to robbery in the 1980s as a quicker way to
make money and buy the crack they needed.
</P>
<P>
   Violent crime surged unexpectedly with the crack epidemic
starting about 1985, and then began to fall, equally unexpectedly,
in 1991. Only in retrospect have law-enforcement authorities and
criminologists been able to theorize about the causes of the rise
and decline in violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference of leading experts in New Orleans this month
sponsored by the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, Alfred
Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, outlined
research on what has come to be the most widely accepted view _
that all of the huge increase in homicide in the late 1980s and
early 1990s was attributable to a rise in killing by juveniles and
young people ages 24 and under, since homicide by adults ages 25
and older has fallen since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   This increase in killing was driven by the sudden spread of
crack markets and the growing use of high-powered semiautomatic
handguns. In fact, Blumstein said, ``The growth in homicides by
young people, which accounted for all the growth in homicides in
the post-1985 period, was accounted for totally by the growth in
homicides committed with handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, homicides have dropped 31 percent, from 9.8 per
100,000 to 6.8 per 100,000 in 1997, while robberies have fallen 32
percent, from 272 per 100,000 to 185 per 100,000 in 1997, according
to the FBI. These are the largest declines for any of the major
violent or property crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Johnson and Andrew Golub, scholars at the National
Development and Research Institutes in New York City, showed the
critical role of crack in leading violent crime up and then down.
When crack arrived in New York in 1985, it created a huge new
market for users and dealers. Unlike heroin, it was sold in small
amounts that provided an intense but short-lasting high that
required users to go on constant ``missions'' to find more.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of unskilled, unemployed young men from New York's
poor inner city neighborhoods jumped into the crack business as
sellers, and to protect themselves in an unstable business
environment, they acquired handguns. An explosion in homicides and
robberies resulted from the combination of impulsive youth, the
confused market situation, the paranoia induced by crack and the
increased firepower of the new handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp drop in violent crime starting in 1991 can be
accounted for by the reversal of these same forces, in what Johnson
and Golub described as ``an indigenous shift,'' as youths who came
of age in the 1990s turned against smoking or selling crack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary reason'' these young people give for avoiding
crack, Johnson and Golub reported, ``is the negative role models in
their lives. They clearly do not want to emulate their parents,
older siblings, close relatives or other associates in their
neighborhoods who were enmeshed with crack.'' Crack produced
``devastation'' in their lives, and they now shun or deride anyone
who smokes crack.
</P>
<P>
   Among other factors that have played a role in the decline in
violence, the experts at the New Orleans conference pointed in
particular to aggressive new actions by the police in many cities
to stop gun violence, either by frequent searches, as has happened
in New York, or by improved efforts to trace guns used in crimes
and arrest gun traffickers, a Boston tactic.
</P>
<P>
   The booming economy of the 1990s has also helped, the experts
agreed, providing legitimate jobs to some urban young people who
had worked in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence on the role of imprisonment in curbing crime is less
clear, the experts said. There is no question that the almost
quadrupling of the number of people incarcerated since 1970, to 1.8
million, has incapacitated many criminals and prevented many
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But since the prison population has expanded steadily over the
past 25 years, it does not explain why crime increased sharply in
the late 1980s or decreased in 1991. Here, said Fox, it may be
necessary to look separately at the incarceration of adults and
juveniles, a study which has not yet been done.

SYL APPS, 83, HALL OF FAME MAPLE LEAFS CENTER
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Canada)   (ms) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Syl Apps, the Hall of Fame center of the Toronto Maple Leafs
when they dominated the National Hockey League in the 1940s and one
of Canada's finest all-around athletes of his era, died Dec. 24 at
his home in Kingston, Ontario. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   In his 10 years in the NHL, Apps had 201 goals and 231 assists
and was renowned for his gentlemanly play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apps is the cleanest player I've ever known,'' said his coach,
Hap Day. ``He never bends an elbow except to twist his stick over
an opponent's wrist. The strongest language he ever uses is `by
hum' and `jiminy Christmas.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Conn Smythe, the Leafs' general manager, would introduce him at
gatherings as ``Syl Apps, our captain, who does not smoke or
drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Apps once flattened a Boston Bruin defenseman who had knocked
out two of his teeth with his stick, but he proved that players did
not have to fight in order to win. In the 1941-42 season, when he
won the Lady Byng Trophy for sportsmanship and did not incur a
single penalty, he was a first-team all-star and a runner-up for
the Hart Trophy as most valuable player. And he led the Maple Leafs
to their first Stanley Cup championship in 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Joseph Sylvanus Apps, a native of Paris, Ontario, also
excelled in football and track and field. He was captain of the
football team at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario,
graduating in 1936, and was the British Empire pole-vault champion
in 1934 and the sixth-place finisher in that event in the 1936
Olympic Games in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Apps won the first Calder Trophy, as the NHL's top rookie, in
the 1936-37 season. An agile skater although a 6-foot 210-pounder,
he led the league in assists, with 29, in each of his first two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Canadian Army in World War II, Apps led the
Maple Leafs to Stanley Cups in 1947 and 1948, then retired. He
finished with a flourish, passing the 200-goal mark in his final
regular-season game, against the Detroit Red Wings, when he scored
three goals, a hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   Apps was a five-time all-star with 432 career points but only 56
penalty minutes, and he was perhaps fortunate that in his later
years he played on a line with Wild Bill Ezinicki, a legendary
tough guy. Apps was given a misconduct penalty, in a game against
Montreal in February 1947, for leaving the bench to enter a fight.
But that penalty was expunged by the NHL president, Clarence
Campbell, who ruled that ``Apps did not leave the bench until after
the play was stopped and took no part in the altercation.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era when Maple Leaf Gardens was a citadel of hockey, Apps
served as the captain on Toronto teams that also had stars like
centers Ted Kennedy and Max Bentley and goalie Turk Broda. Apps was
elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   He ran unsuccessfully for the Canadian parliament in the spring
of 1940 when he sandwiched campaign speeches between hockey games.
After retiring as a player, he served as Ontario's athletic
commissioner, was a Conservative member of the Ontario Legislature
from 1963 to 1974 and was minister of correctional services in the
Ontario cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his wife, Mary; two sons, Syl Jr., who
played in the NHL, with the Rangers, Penguins and Kings, and Robert
Apps; and three daughters, Joanne, Carol and Janet. A grandson, Syl
Apps 3rd, is a center for the Princeton University hockey team.
Another grandson, Darren Barber, won a gold medal with the Canadian
eight-oars rowing squad at the 1992 Olympics.

SENATORS SAY A CENSURE SEEMS LIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, S.D., Ky., La., N.Y.)  (See also IMPEACH-REPUBS) 
(lb) 
 By TIM WEINER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's impeachment trial will proceed,
but the likely result will be censure, not conviction and removal
from office, several senators said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a trial and there will be censure and then, God
willing, there'll be closure,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., in an appearance on the NBC News program ``Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators making the Sunday talk-show rounds said in varying ways
that a trial was inevitable, and some said a vote on the two
articles of impeachment passed by the House of Representatives must
take place. But none of them expressed the belief that Clinton
could be convicted by the constitutionally required two-thirds
majority of the Senate, or 67 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to probably begin the trial,'' said Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who serves as chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee. He added, ``At that point, I think if our colleagues on
the other side show that there are at least 34 people who will
never vote for impeachment or conviction,'' the best option would
be censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody would deny the statement that we
probably don't have a two-thirds vote to convict the president,''
said Hatch, speaking on the CBS News program ``Face the Nation.''
``Then it seems to me we're going to have to do what is the next
best thing, and that is point out to the American people how really
bad his actions were.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said on
``Meet the Press'' that there was ``a sense among many senators
that while the offenses may not reach the impeachable level, there
is some sanction that should be applied here, some form of
punishment, and censure is a very serious, very historic and rare,
form of punishment that ought to be considered.''
</P>
<P>
   No senator predicted that the extraordinary business of putting
a president on trial, which has taken place only once in American
history, was likely to end in Clinton's conviction and removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to vote on these articles of impeachment, and then
that is the appropriate time to consider a censure,'' Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., said on ``Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming neither of those articles pass,'' he said, members of
the Senate must ``negotiate the censure alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and McConnell agreed that a trial involving lengthy and
potentially embarrassing appearances by witnesses like Monica
Lewinsky and Linda Tripp was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for this to take three to six months,''
Hatch said. ``It could, if people start calling witnesses, but I
don't see any reason to call those witnesses. I think the president
has already admitted to some very terrible things.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said, ``It's not at all clear to me that we have to
put on a sort of public show trial and bring all of these rather
infamous characters in to testify before the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said on ``Face the Nation'' that
``a long-drawn-out, protracted debate and long-drawn-out trial
complete with witnesses ends up punishing the country more than it
punishes the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment among many Democrats in the Senate is in favor of
censure. Many senators on both sides of the aisle have said they
want some form of trial on the charges of perjury and obstruction
of justice stemming from the president's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, which were passed in a vote along party lines by the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Some have said they feel obliged to take the matter to trial
following the House vote. All are aware of the prevailing public
sentiment that the matter should be brought to a close.

   ``I think the American people have told us that they want some
place where Bill Clinton can be held accountable, where he can
atone for what he has done, where he can get the punishment that he
is due,'' the president's former spokesman, Mike McCurry, said on
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   The blot of impeachment will always be with Clinton, no matter
what course the Senate takes, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is going to be with him forever,'' he said, ``and that is
_ believe me, for someone who loves the presidency and loves that
White House and is a student of it _ that will hurt him a lot
forever, when he's down in Little Rock at his library.''

HIS JOB IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS EGO, ANNAN SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ At the end of his second year as
secretary-general, Kofi Annan offers no apologies for going the
extra mile to talk with tyrants like Saddam Hussein and Col.
Moammar Gadhafi, even when a rebuff, or carping in Washington, is
his only reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with issues of war and peace,'' Annan said in an
interview last week, rounding out the year as he began it, with a
crisis in Iraq. ``We are operating in a world which is quite brutal
and there are some very wicked people around. Nobody denies that.
But in the business that I'm in, we sometimes have to shake the
hands of the aggressor, to lend them an ear, in order to save
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I go where I have to go, I talk to those I have to talk to,''
Annan said of his trips to Iraq in February and to Libya early this
month. ``I hope the day will come when the secretary-general of the
U.N. has to talk only to leaders of countries like Switzerland,
Sweden, Costa Rica, Botswana. Then our work would be done.''
</P>
<P>
   But a different view is sometimes held in Washington. A pall of
disappointment if not despair has been cast over Annan's relations
with an often hostile Congress and to some extent the Clinton
administration, which denied his predecessor, Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, a second term in office and engineered Annan's
election by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was criticized for going to Baghdad, Iraq, in February and
brokering an accord over arms inspections that quickly unraveled.
Although the Clinton White House, then in the early days of the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, seemed relieved at the time, the
secretary-general was later accused, especially in Congress, of
diplomatic meddling and of drawing out the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's journey to meet with Gadhafi on Dec. 5 drew still more
flak. The Libyan leader left Annan waiting for hours before meeting
him in a tent at a remote site in the desert, where Annan was
trying to work out a deal for Libya to turn over two suspects
wanted in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, 10 years ago. The attempt proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Annan's aides say, he was essentially promoting
American as well as international goals: compliance from Iraq on
arms inspections, and the turning over of two men wanted in a
long-delayed trial.
</P>
<P>
   Has the secretary-general been too willing to take political
risks? Has Annan been too quick to expend his personal prestige and
that of his office?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to do a job, and self is not involved, because we're
dealing with much bigger issues, much more at stake,'' he said.
``To put my own ego or my own reputation at the center of it, I
think, would be unconscionable and would be a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Events play their part in shaping the reputation of any
secretary-general. Sir Brian Urquhart, a former
undersecretary-general who has known every holder of the United
Nations' highest office since the organization's founding in 1945,
said last week that Annan ``couldn't have inherited that job at a
more difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the stage is set, character and personality take over,
Urquhart added. ``I think Kofi is a genuinely natural,
unpretentious, very serious person,'' he said. ``He really believes
he's got to do the job, and it's not a popularity contest. He's
there to do his best, and if it blows back on him, that's too
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Danilo Turk, a former professor of international law and a human
rights advocate who is Slovenia's representative and a member of
the Security Council, said Annan has to do an already ill-defined
job ``in an era more chaotic than other periods.''
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the Cold War, rogue states are less likely to be
held on tethers by Moscow or Washington, Turk noted, and today's
secretary-general faces crises that can quickly spin out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   He also faces that political chaos at a time when the United
Nations has been under tremendous pressure to reduce its budgets
and bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Annan has made significant managerial reforms and has
continued to cut the headquarters staff, the Republican-led
Congress refuses to pay $1.2 billion in American debts without
attaching riders that U.N. officials say improperly attempt to
micromanage the organization, which no one nation among the 185
members has the right to do.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Annan, a Ghanaian, dealing with Africa has been particularly
difficult. He began his term in January 1997 ready to forge a
partnership with Africans moving to put conflict behind them. Two
years later, Angola is descending into civil war again, rebels in
Sierra Leone notorious for their extraordinary brutality are
closing in on the capital less than a year after being driven out,
and east-central Africa is engulfed in a conflict involving nearly
a dozen nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening in Africa is a tragedy, a real tragedy,''
Annan said. ``It's a deep disappointment.'' He said he recently
told a meeting of African leaders in Paris that at a time when they
needed investment and development, they were on a suicidal course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that compared to other regions we are weak,'' he
said. ``We are weak even when we are united. Divided and
conflict-ridden, we don't stand a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan, frequently accompanied by his Swedish wife, Nane, travels
extensively, more than many U.N. officials and diplomats think is
necessary, given all the work at headquarters. Aides counter that
his talks with foreign leaders are important, and he has a good
stand-in, Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette of Canada,
whose reputation as a manager is formidable.
</P>
<P>
   The first secretary-general to come from the ranks of the U.N.
secretariat, Annan has surrounded himself with a loyal staff
collected over years, who moved with him from the peacekeeping
department, which he formerly headed, to the organization's
isolated 38th floor. Wanting to shield him, they have instead cut
him off from much of the organization and many outside contacts,
some other officials say. That seems to be a minority view,
however.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Annan says he values the widest possible contacts.
His staff says he also seeks out special friends in international
affairs whose judgment he trusts, among them president Nelson
Mandela of South Africa and Richard Holbrooke, the American
diplomat and Balkans troubleshooter who is in line to become the
U.S. representative at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to lots of people,'' Annan said in his uniformly soft,
melodic voice, which sinks at times almost to a whisper. ``I talk
to people inside the building, outside the building, in different
fields, in different walks of life. Men and women who understand
the human condition and have compassion. People who like to do
things about the world we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Urquhart, who worked closely with the alternately mercurial and
mystical Dag Hammarskjold _ the second secretary-general, who died
in a plane crash during another Congo crisis _ is struck by the way
both men have demonstrated a willingness to get involved in ``hard
cases.'' The difference is that whereas Hammarskjold had a fitful
temper and could sink into obsessive brooding, Annan ``is at ease
with himself,'' Urquhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes people,'' he said of Annan. ``He genuinely enjoys
life. He doesn't get unduly upset about temporary setbacks. It's
just as well, because this is a very frustrating time to be the
secretary-general.''

<P>
   GAZA _ A day after the Palestinian Authority lifted Sheik Ahmed
Yassin's house arrest, his Land Rover, a gift from the Saudis,
plowed through the sand at a refugee camp here, headed for a sound
stage decorated with murals celebrating armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Bodyguards hoisted Yassin's wheelchair onto the stage, and the
ephemeral-looking Islamic cleric, swathed in flowing white, gazed
out at the 10,000 people awaiting his first public words in two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Against a backdrop of painted grenades, leaping flames and
raised fists, Yassin, 63, the founder and spiritual leader of
Hamas, delivered a fiery 15-minute speech. In his high-pitched,
raspy voice, the words sounded as otherworldly as they were
inflammatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must continue on our path to holy war,'' he said, at this
rally marking the 11th anniversary of the Hamas movement, which has
waged a deadly war of terror against Israel. ``We celebrate today
the uprising that confronted the Israeli occupation with stones,
with Molotov cocktails and with guns, uniting our people, the sons
of Palestine, the sons of Jerusalem, the sons of our homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   After the American-brokered Wye River agreement between Israel
and the Palestinians was signed in late October, Yassin was locked
in his house by the Palestinian Authority, his phone lines cut and
his daily parade of visitors shut out.
</P>
<P>
   When the authority lifted his house arrest on Dec. 24, the
Israeli government was quick to condemn what officials described as
a Palestinian retreat from the promise to crack down on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you want to interview me?'' Yassin asked in his
distinctive voice, smiling as if at an inside joke. ``To show the
world a first-class example of the famous revolving door?''
</P>
<P>
   He may appear otherworldly, but he is as engaged as any Middle
Eastern politician in the terms of debate. He was referring to the
Israeli coinage for what they see as the circulation of terrorists
through Palestinian jails.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians said they had released the sheik, a popular
figure in much of the Gaza Strip, as a gesture of good will at the
start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   But Yassin agreed with the Israelis that the move had probably
been made in direct response to an Israeli suspension of further
withdrawals from the West Bank required by the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a card that they play,'' he said, referring to the
Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in his brother's humble home in Gaza, Yassin, who is
paralyzed, nearly blind and very hard of hearing, laughed with the
relatives and acolytes who surrounded him _ and ribbed him _ during
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Several times he motioned with his head for the conversation to
stop because airplanes overhead, audible to no one else, were
interfering with reception on his hearing aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could use you for radar,'' his brother joked, then grew
serious. ``We do use you for radar, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months ago the Israelis released Yassin from their jails
in exchange for the release from Jordanian prison of two agents of
the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, who had botched an
attempt to assassinate a Hamas leader in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Yassin has proved a nettlesome presence to the
Palestinians. That is partly because he preaches against the peace
effort and assists, even if indirectly, in bringing terror attacks.
But it is also because he holds as much sway over poor Palestinians
in the Gaza Strip as Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian
Authority _ if not more.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at the rally on Friday, Yassin's words were received as
if from an oracle by a worshipful crowd in the Shati camp _ a Hamas
stronghold that Hillary Rodham Clinton visited 11 days earlier
during President Clinton's ill-fated peacemaking mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a super-leader, larger than life,'' said Rawda Jamal,
who held her swaddled baby up to see the frail cleric. ``It was a
disaster that the Palestinian Authority put him under house arrest
after all those years in Israeli prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   During his house arrest, Yassin said, the satellite atop his
modest home in the shabby Zeitun section of Gaza linked him to the
world. He watched Clinton's visit to Gaza on television, he said,
dismayed to see the U.S. president presiding over a meeting of the
Palestine National Council in which it revoked from its charter
clauses calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sad spectacle,'' Yassin said, ``to see my fellow
Palestinians applauding and chanting while they were deleting part
of our history and their charter. That's why our rallies took place
in protest: because they were turning their back on our common
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the two months of his house arrest, he again smiled
his inward smile, while a son gently eased the sheik's swollen feet
into fleece-lined boots. Because Yassin's physical therapists were
not allowed to visit during that time, the son _ one of his 11
children _ trained at a local hospital to nurse his father and to
exercise his limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy,'' Yassin said. ``It was excellent. I had time to
worship, to read the Koran. I was able to finish reading three
doctoral dissertations about the holy war. I had some time to see
my wife and children. Reasonable people cannot look on ill fortune
as ill fortune. I prefer to see the glass as half full.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said of the detention, ``I was not happy that this
order came from my brothers. If it had come from the Jews, it would
have been natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Yassin's house arrest followed a suicide bomb attack on a school
bus filled with Jewish settlers' children in Gaza. The children
escaped harm, but two Israeli soldiers, who drove their jeep
between the bomber's car and the bus, were killed, along with the
bomber.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally, one speaker thundered, ``Clinton is a Jew!''
Schoolchildren read poems extolling holy war. A group of young
teen-age boys, who sounded like an Islamic Menudo, sang to the
feedback of bad amplifiers. Iraqi flags were waved, but in
deference to the conditions in their rally permit, no Israeli or
U.S. flags were burned and no weapons fired.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Yassin condemned the Palestinian Authority
without naming it or Arafat. Directing his anger into the two
orange microphones held in his face, he called it corrupt and spoke
out against its attempt to stifle the Palestinian news media and
what he called its concessions to the Israelis and the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As he talked into a chill wind that swirled the sand, his
bodyguard kept the sheik's white head covering from flapping
forward and covering his face.
</P>
<P>
   Face to face, Yassin transmits an eerie kind of serenity,
uttering harsh words as gently as if he were talking to a small
child. The contrast between tone and substance can be chilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We extended our hand to the world to help us get back our
land, and nobody cared,'' the sheik said. ``Don't you think it's
reasonable, then, for us, to carry an ax on our shoulders and make
demands?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that meant that Hamas, which committed no attacks
during the sheik's house arrest, would strike again soon, he
answered indirectly and with one of the many metaphors he employs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you have seen and will see, for every action there is a
reaction,'' he said. ``Our Palestinian people are like gold. The
more you pressure them, the more they shine.''
</P>
<P>
   The men around him nodded, and some stomachs grumbled, as it was
shortly before the day's fast for Ramadan was to be broken with a
plate of dates.

ISLANDERS TRYING AGAIN TO SCORE ON HASEK
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Part 2 of the confrontation between Dominik Hasek and Martin
Brodeur will be staged Monday night in Buffalo, two days after the
Sabres' goalie emerged as the victor the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek put on a brilliant exhibition of goaltending Saturday
night in New Jersey as Buffalo scored a 2-0 victory. Brodeur was
just as good in goal for the Devils, but he allowed one goal _ the
other came late in the game on an empty net _ and that was all
Hasek needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always fun to play against the best,'' Brodeur said of
his latest confrontation with Hasek, who turned aside 34 shots
Saturday night. ``We have to find a way to beat them. We have to
find a way to get through to Hasek.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik, who had seven shots against Hasek, and Petr Sykora,
who had four, said they know the way to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do,'' Sykora said, ``is create traffic in
front of him, make a screen so that he doesn't see the puck. It's
tough to score against him when he sees the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Holik said of Hasek: ``They have the best goalie in the world,
and we have to put ourselves in front on him. He's so good because
he sees the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing what to do against Hasek and actually doing it are two
different things. Ask Sykora, the talented young wing, who has 10
goals this season for the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had several good chances against Hasek, but the best
might have belonged to Sykora. It came with six minutes left in the
second period and the game scoreless when Sykora entered Buffalo's
zone with speed from right to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cut into the middle and I had him beat,'' Sykora said. ``But
I was falling down and couldn't get it upstairs. If the shot would
have been high, I would have scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Having to switch from side to side, Hasek found himself on his
back. Sykora flew by Hasek and tried to lift the puck, but he was
unable to because he went sprawling near the bottom of the left
circle. The puck ended up in Hasek's possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get intimidated by him,'' Sykora said. ``He's just
another goalie in the league. It's just a little more challenging
to score against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Goal scorers around the National Hockey League have found out
how difficult it has been to score against Hasek in recent years,
but this month he has been virtually impossible to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek has started every game this season, the only goaltender in
the league to do so. He played 11 games this month and has lost
once, a 3-2 decision to the Carolina Hurricanes. He also had a 2-2
tie with St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine games Hasek won this month, he allowed a total of
six goals, and his shutout of the Devils was his fourth in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek's shutout on Saturday was also his second in a row,
seventh of the season and 40th of his career. He has a stretch of
163 minutes 35 seconds without allowing a goal. His goals against
average is 1.60 for the season, and he is already being touted as
the favorite to capture his third consecutive Hart Trophy as the
league's most valuable player. No other goaltender in the history
of the league has captured the Hart Trophy more than once.
</P>
<P>
   But Hasek would probably let Brodeur have all the trophies and
honors that he has amassed in exchange for having his name on the
Stanley Cup. Brodeur may have lost some battles against Hasek, but
he still has a winning record against him and he was the winner in
the only playoff series in which he faced the Sabres' goalie, in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (19-6-5) and the Devils (19-9-4) are leading their
respective divisions and are almost certain to be playing hockey
deep into the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But Holik observed: ``It's too early to talk about playoffs and
comparing teams. So much can happen between now and April.'' &QL;

of key injuries and not looking like chumps. With its 38-16 victory
Sunday, Atlanta (14-2) was the clear winner in most of those
categories, although the team received a huge scare in the first
quarter when quarterback Chris Chandler was dragged down from
behind and strained his lower back after passing for his second
touchdown. As a precaution, he did not return, and the Falcons'
interim coach, Rich Brooks, said Chandler should be fine when the
Falcons play host to the Dallas Cowboys, San Francisco 49ers or
Green Bay Packers in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons received a pre-game visit from Coach Dan Reeves, who
is recovering from heart bypass surgery, and Chandler said, ``It
was definitely a motivating factor for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins (10-6) will play Buffalo next Saturday afternoon in
Miami. But they will do so without defensive end Jason Taylor, who
is second on the team in sacks. Taylor broke his right clavicle in
the first quarter of the game Sunday and will miss the remainder of
the season. It was a painful exclamation point to a dismal day for
the Dolphins, who committed six turnovers and fell behind, 21-0, in
the first quarter and trailed, 38-6, in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing the way we played in that first quarter,''
said Miami coach Jimmy Johnson. ``To commit six turnovers and not
have any of our own, that's embarrassing. We made a lot of mistakes
and once it got out of hand, I don't think we played real hard.''
</P>
<P>
   While it was bitter for Johnson and the Dolphins, it was sweet
for Falcons running back Jamal Anderson, who enhanced his personal
portfolio and launched a campaign for the league's most valuable
player. Anderson had 18 carries for 103 yards and a touchdown (on a
36-yard run). The 18 carries gave him 410 for the season, an NFL
record, and his 16 touchdowns this year were a team record.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can say that you've carried the ball more times in a
season than any back in the long history of the game, it's an
honor,'' Anderson said. ``The good thing is that I feel great. I'm
not all banged up.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's not one of those records you want to approach
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when he does not touch the ball, Anderson proves to be an
incredible weapon for the team. On the first play of the game,
Chandler faked a handoff to Anderson. Nine Dolphin defenders ran to
the left with Anderson, and Chandler bootlegged the ball to the
right, throwing to tight end O.J. Santiago in the flat. Santiago
managed to shake off cornerback Terrell Buckley on the way to a
62-yard touchdown play.
</P>
<P>
   On Atlanta's next possession, Chandler combined with Tony Martin
on a 53-yard pass, setting up a 3-yard scoring pass to Santiago.
Chandler hobbled off on that play with his back strain, having been
pulled down by the Dolphins' Kenny Mixon.
</P>
<P>
   After Steve DeBerg took over at quarterback, the Falcons went up
21-0 and took the Dolphins completely out of their game plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons unleashed their early spurt after a brief visit from
Reeves, who underwent surgery 13 days ago. Reeves had gone back
into the hospital last week with an irregular heart beat, but had
been released with a warning from his doctors not to attend the
game or exert himself. In his pre-game talk to the team, he told
the Falcons to play this game as if it were as important as the
others. They followed his prescription.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 21-point first quarter made his day a little easier,''
Brooks said. ``He was able to relax at home and just enjoy the rest
of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was far from a relaxing day for Miami quarterback Dan Marino,
who had helped his team engineer a splendid victory against the
Denver Bronocs last Monday night. Marino threw for 320 yards and a
touchdown, but his two interceptions were killers. One was returned
11 yards for a touchdown by cornerback Ronnie Bradford in that
first-quarter assault.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' cornerbacks entered the game expecting to see the
hot Marino that burned Denver last week. So, they had a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``As cornerbacks, we just wanted to run with the receivers and
let them take us to the ball and not worry about Dan,'' said
Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan. Perhaps if the Dolphins had an
effective running game, they could have made it interesting.
</P>
<P>
   But the starting running back Karim Abdul Jabbar was out with a
concussion he suffered two games ago. And fumbles by running backs
Ron Moore and John Avery in the third quarter helped bury the
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons managed to convert both turnovers into touchdowns.
Moore's resulted in a 35-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Steve
DeBerg to receiver Tony Martin that helped make it 31-6 and Avery's
led to Anderson's 36-yard touchdown run that helped make it 38-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't seem that we came ready to play today,'' Marino
said. ``We better play better versus Buffalo next week.''

SMALLEST OCTUPLET DIES; OTHERS STILL CRITICAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The smallest of the week-old octuplets born to a
Houston woman died early Sunday after the infant's heart and lungs
gave out and mechanical respiration failed, according to Texas
Children's Hospital in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The baby, Chijindu Chidera Chukwu, nicknamed Odera, took a
sudden and critical turn for the worse on Saturday night, after
doctors moved her from a standard ventilator to a different type
known as an oscillator in an unsuccessful effort to increase the
amount of oxygen-rich blood in her body.
</P>
<P>
   Odera was the fifth of the octuplets born this month to Nkem
Chukwu and her husband, Iyke Louis Udobi, who are from Nigeria and
are U.S. citizens. Odera's condition began to deteriorate about the
time that her mother visited all eight babies for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving seven babies remain in critical condition in a
neonatal intensive care unit at the hospital. The youngest, Gorom,
is recovering from abdominal surgery performed on Saturday to
repair a hole in her intestine. Two of the babies are on mechanical
ventilators and the remaining four are breathing on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chukwu's condition was reported as stable.
</P>
<P>
   Odera's name translated to ``God Has My Life,'' the hospital
said. Through the hospital, the parents said they were ``very
saddened'' by Odera's death and thanked people for their prayers
and donations.
</P>
<P>
   Odera weighed 10.3 ounces and was 9.75 inches long when she was
born at Texas Children's Hospital, which describes itself as the
largest pediatric hospital in the United States. All of the babies
weighed less than 2 pounds at birth. The largest weighed 1 pound 11
ounces. The first child was delivered on Dec. 8 and the rest on
Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The Associated Press reported that doctors at the
hospital gave the babies an 85 percent chance of survival. But that
level of optimism has surprised many doctors not connected with the
octuplets' case.
</P>
<P>
   One, Dr. Ayman El-Mohandes, an attending neonatologist at George
Washington University Hospital in Washington, said that he thought
the odds were ``less than 50 percent'' and that 20 percent was a
more reasonable figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have very many babies in the United States that have
survived at a similar weight,'' El-Mohandes said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of such a baby's survival depend on many factors. The
fact that each of the eight babies weighed less than 2 pounds
``showed how retarded growth was from the environment they had to
endure'' in the womb, El-Mohandes said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Doctors call the condition ``in utero growth retardation,''
meaning that the baby weighs less than its gestational age would
indicate. Yet some such babies do better than others who have the
same weight but a younger gestational age. One theory is that ``the
stress of surviving in utero leads to increased production of
steroids and chemicals known as catecholamines that help the lungs
mature a little more than the baby's gestation would indicate,''
El-Mohandes said.
</P>
<P>
   In such babies, El-Mohandes added, ``we worry about how much
nutrition and oxygen the body organs received.''
</P>
<P>
   Another variable in the odds of survival is the location of the
placenta in the womb, because certain parts of the womb have a
better blood supply. Some of the eight placentae implanted in Nkem
Chukwu's uterus had a better opportunity to grow, simply because of
the overcrowding on the uterine wall, El-Mohandes said.
</P>
<P>
   After birth, ``lung function is the initial stumbling block in
survival,'' El-Mohandes said,
</P>
<P>
   A standard ventilator inflates the lungs a specified number of
times a minute, but pumps air in under pressure, which can cause
lung damage.
</P>
<P>
   Because Odera failed to respond to a standard ventilator,
doctors had to switch her to an oscillator. It vibrates air at high
frequencies, with the aim of increasing the amounts of oxygen in
the lungs and removing more carbon dioxide. It does this without
using the very high pressures that are necessary to inflate the
lungs completely with every breath.
</P>
<P>
   Another survival factor is the difficulty that small babies have
in regulating the amount of fluids and salts, like sodium and
potassium, that their bodies need. Normally, the kidneys
automatically regulate such amounts, but those organs are often not
fully developed in low birth-weight babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smaller they are, the more difficult it is to control
their fluid'' and chemical balance, El-Mohandes said.

ISLANDERS COACH CONCERNED ABOUT LACHANCE'S MISTAKES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ There are games when Scott Lachance is
outstanding, when he flashes the skills and instincts that for
years have made him one of the Islanders' most reliable defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are games when he passes the puck to an opposing
player in a crucial situation or unintentionally knocks the puck
into the Islanders' goal, which he has done four times this season.
Recently, Lachance's play declined so much that Mike Milbury, the
Islanders coach and general manager, scratched him three times and
said publicly that Lachance has lost his spot on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury first took a healthy Lachance, who is minus-10 in the
plus-minus rating this season, out of the lineup on Dec. 15 against
San Jose. The coach benched him again for the Islanders' next game,
on Dec. 17 against Los Angeles, and Lachance has not played
regularly since.
</P>
<P>
   After the back-to-back scratches, Lachance returned for the
Islanders' next two games, but did not play well enough to gain
back Milbury's confidence. After Lachance missed last Tuesday's
game against St. Louis with the flu, he was scratched on Saturday,
even with an injury to Bryan Berard, for the Islanders 4-2 victory
over Boston at Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury thinks that Lachance, a first-round draft pick and the
fourth pick over all in 1991, can still be a good player. He thinks
the problem is Lachance's mental approach to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said this about Scott Lachance since the day I got
here,'' Milbury said. ``He'll play in this league as long as he
wants. He's got talent, he can skate and he's big in big games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I haven't seen and what I continue not to see is
consistency in effort and intensity,'' Milbury said. ``We have
other guys who are trying very hard, who really care and really
try. I'm not saying that his performances are inconsistent. It's
possible that he's lost a spot here and he'll have to wait for an
opportunity. He's going to have to win a spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lachance was visibly shaken by Milbury's post-game comments when
reporters relayed them to him in the locker room after Saturday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to do what I can,'' Lachance said quietly.
``I'm not going to comment on what Mike said. I'd like to discuss
it in private with Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the coach's decision,'' Lachance said. ``All I can do is
work hard as I can to get back into the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be easy for Lachance, since the Islanders have been
stockpiling defenseman. They picked up Eric Cairns, the former
Ranger, off of waivers last week, and now have eight defenseman on
the roster. When Berard returns from a strained groin in a couple
of weeks, and Cairns returns soon from a sore ankle, something is
going to have to give.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers Eric Brewer, Barry Richter and Zdeno Chara have
given surprisingly solid performances, so Milbury has not felt any
pressure to play Lachance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite clues suggesting otherwise, Milbury said he won't trade
Lachance. ``But I'm in no rush to give away Scott Lachance,''
Milbury said. ``The day I trade him is the day I've failed as a
coach.'' &QL;

BIGGEST CHANGES IN TV HISTORY COMING WITH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also DIGITAL-RADIO-MEDIA) 
(mk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For an aviation buff, the Discovery Wings cable channel is a
dream come true _ programs about planes and flying all day long.
</P>
<P>
   Replace the aviation aficionado with a health nut hungry for the
latest medical news (tuned to Discovery Health), or a
do-it-yourselfer immersed in home renovations (Discovery Home and
Leisure), or a schoolchild exploring ancient worlds (Discovery
Civilization) _ Discovery has a channel for each.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, MTV Networks, parent of MTV and VH1, has sprouted
seven more offspring for different genres _ VH1 Country, VH1 Soul,
VH1 Smooth (jazz and ``New Age'' music), M2 (regular MTV on a
different time schedule), MTV Ritmo (Latin music), MTV Rocks (hard
rock and heavy metal) and MTV Indie (independent music and rap) _
making a miniature radio dial on the television set.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 2 million homes can receive these
niche-within-a-niche cable channels, but they offer a glimpse of a
vastly different media universe of the not-too-distant future, a
world where an American audience already fragmented by myriad cable
channels will be splintered into even tinier shards, as when Fox
Family Channel recently announced the creation of separate networks
for boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   Digital technology _ which enables the television signal to be
compressed to carry far more information _ is ushering in this new
age, when perhaps 1,400 or 1,500 choices will be on parade. Some of
those choices will take forms people now associate with the
computer rather than the television set, like bringing data to the
screen, or Internet access, or interactive shopping, banking or
video games.
</P>
<P>
   The first tentative steps into this future are taking place,
recalling the days when television itself was being created by
people who, at first, tried simply to re-create popular radio shows
on film. Television industry leaders today are as uncertain as they
were then about how to use this new medium, and about what viewers
will want from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition to DTV is the biggest change in television
history since television began,'' said Sandra Kresch, a partner in
the entertainment and media division of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the
giant business consulting firm. ``Everyone has a vague idea of what
the technology will produce; everyone has a vague idea of what
consumers will want. But this has the potential to be so different
from anything that's come before that nobody is really sure how
it's going to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, digital cable television is transmitted primarily to
cable systems around the country owned by Tele-Communications Inc.;
since it was first offered in late 1997, about 1.4 million cable
customers have signed up for it. They get a package of 36 extra
channels for $10 a month, and pay between $3 and $4 a month to rent
a set-top box required to bring in the digital signal.
</P>
<P>
   Digital signals can also provide high-definition television, or
HDTV _ pictures so crystalline and detailed that they look like
Hieronymous Bosch paintings come to life. Most experts predict that
HDTV sets' prices will stay high, moving from $7,000-plus now to
around $3,000 in three years, and causing HDTV to take a decade or
more to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   But standard-definition digital television sets _ with clearer
pictures than current sets, and the capacity to pull in hundreds of
channels _ are a better bet for mass consumption. Experts say their
prices will come down under the $1,000 mark within about three
years' time.
</P>
<P>
   For the near future, the average viewer with a digital
television set will begin to see three main uses of the greater
channel capacity: programs shown in high-definition format (HDTV);
many more channel choices (multicasting), or varied choices of
starting times for movies and events (multiplexing).
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer is being offered a decision,'' said Thomas
Rogers, president of NBC Cable and executive vice president of NBC,
a unit of General Electric Co. ``Do they want more choices or
prettier pictures? My guess is the answer will be a resounding vote
for both.''
</P>
<P>
   But because the prettier pictures cost more to produce, and
fewer people are likely to buy those expensive HDTV-ready sets,
most experts think the industry will concentrate on greater choices
_ in programming and in data broadcasting. Viewing habits are
expected to involve even narrower, more individually tailored and,
eventually, interactive choices as digital television takes hold.
</P>
<P>
   Take the example of the home fixer-upper who watches the
Discovery Home and Leisure channel now. A rival, called the
Do-It-Yourself Channel, is to start next year, as a spinoff of the
Home and Garden Television network. And HGTV is developing another
digital channel, called HGTV Professional, for builders,
contractors, plumbers, landscapers and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Critics worry that this will add more schlock and confusion to
the television landscape, and that public-affairs programs and
entrepreneurs with new program ideas will both be frozen out.
</P>
<P>
   This issue is a question of capacity, and of who puts claims on
that capacity. Each current broadcast station (like Channel 2 or 4
in New York) and each cable network ``owns'' the subdivisions of
itself that digitalization will create. They will want to hold onto
that real estate, so to speak, for the day when they find
profitable ways to use it. The same is true for cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires cable systems to carry the signals of local
broadcast stations (in addition to whatever cable networks they
carry). Station owners want that requirement extended, so that
cable has to carry all the subchannels of Channel 2, for example,
not just the main analog Channel 2. But cable operators argue that
if they must carry all those channels, nonprofit networks like
C-Span and community public access channels could get squeezed out
_ unless government regulations were passed to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Public television, too, awaits action from either Congress or
the Federal Communications Commission on whether cable systems must
carry all its channel offerings. And while public television
programmers have many ideas for new educational or public-service
uses of the added channels, they need to find ways to finance them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, programmers are trying to position themselves in the
new universe.
</P>
<P>
   That is why A&AMP;E Networks (which is jointly owned by Walt Disney
Co., Hearst Corp. and NBC) has started the Biography Channel and
the International History Channel, expanding on two of its most
popular existing program brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like rolling the dice right now,'' said Nikolas Davatzes,
A&AMP;E Networks' president. ``I said to myself, `I'm not sure where
this ship is going, but I'm getting on it.' I don't want to be in a
position of finding out they discovered America and I'm not there
because I'm still in Greece tending my sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the rush to gain a foothold on cable systems, some cable
networks have simply devised spinoffs using old programming they
already own (like Fox's Boyz and Girlz channels), or rearranged
programs from their libraries on different time schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid some people may be establishing digital tiers as
the re-run channels, and those are not worth paying extra for,''
said Ms. Kresch of PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   She also warns broadcasters and cable networks to be aware of
what new media providers may offer customers. Telephone and
computer companies are busily working with manufacturers to
transform the television set (whether it receives its signal via
cable or satellite) into the central appliance for all sorts of
services _ not only for watching programs, but for Internet entry,
electronic commerce and even access to telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   In Rogers' view, the cable industry will focus on delivering
more channels (a business it has already refined) and the broadcast
networks will specialize in high-definition transmission of
important or glamorous events like the Super Bowl, and in upgrading
some of their library (especially news programs) to digital format.
</P>
<P>
   But the broadcast networks know that the ultimate
decision-making lies with the stations, most of which they do not
own. Only 43 broadcast stations are transmitting digitally now;
another 40 to 50 should be able to do so by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Will the nation's 400-plus stations eventually want
high-definition programs provided by their networks, to give
viewers state-of-the-art pictures? Or will stations want to use
their subchannels for highly localized programming _ news, weather,
sports, community affairs or even educational fare _ with plenty of
spots for local commercials?
</P>
<P>
   For now, ABC, which is owned by Disney, is focused on
transforming theatrical movies like ``101 Dalmations'' into
high-definition format, and has already broadcast four of them. CBS
Corp. is experimenting instead with football, sending out four
National Footbal League games in high-definition format this
season.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has announced no plans beyond converting the ``Tonight''
show with Jay Leno to high-definition digital transmission in the
spring. News Corp.'s Fox says its plans are still in formation, but
a company executive who insisted on anonymity said the network was
likely to encourage its stations to go the local-interest route.
</P>
<P>
   In general, cable networks, as was the case in their earliest
years, are the ones brainstorming ever more finely tuned channels,
this time to offer as additional packages to digital-ready
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery Networks, owned by Discovery Communications Inc., and
MTV Networks, which is part of Viacom Inc., have been the pioneers,
which makes sense, since the costs of generating new channels are
better amortized by a company already well established and already
producing shows for many channels.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``the suite'' _ MTV's name for its array of music
channels _ the children's cable network Nickelodeon, which is also
owned by MTV Networks, will start Nickelodeon GAS (Games and
Sports) and Noggin (preschool educational fare) next year, as well
as Nick Too, a reprise of regular Nickelodeon but with all shows
shifted to different time slots.
</P>
<P>
   The Bravo Network, another Cablevision unit, plans an
International Film Channel. Its corporate sibling American Movie
Classics has started American Pop, a channel devoted to the history
of popular culture. And Lifetime, jointly owned by Hearst and ABC,
is developing a 24-hour Lifetime Movie Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've created from Discovery's channels is basically a
digital magazine rack full of specialty magazines,'' said Charley
Humbard, Discovery's vice president and general manager for digital
networks and advanced television. ``The person who is an enthusiast
of a particular subject will have continual access to that subject,
virtually on demand.''
</P>
<P>
   But will enough enthusiasts actually buy set-top boxes or
subscribe to extra channel packages to make a profit for those who
produce the new channels?
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rosenthal, president and chief operating officer of MTV
Networks, thinks they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, when cable started, you had four or five
options _ ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS and maybe an independent station,'' he
said. ``You didn't sit around thinking, `I wish I had 40 channels.'
But when they became available, you re-learned how to use your
television. The same thing will happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   And as consumers become more accustomed to using the Internet _
where instead of hundreds of options, there are literally millions
_ television providers will start linking their programming to
related sites on the World Wide Web, and so will advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sometimes say this is like the transition from
black-and-white to color television,'' said Tom Tyrer, vice
president of corporate communications for News Corp.'s Fox
Broadcasting unit. ``It's not. It's like the transition from radio
to television. It's a whole new world.''

   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia _ As the truce in Kosovo province continued
to disintegrate, rebels came down from the hills Sunday and
attacked a large police post here between the capital of Belgrade
and Pristina, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats questioned whether the international monitors who
are trying to keep the cease-fire from collapsing will be
sufficient in number and will learn how to restore peace in time to
prevent full-scale war in this Balkan region. About 2,000 monitors
are expected, but fewer than half that number are in place.
</P>
<P>
   While the police fought ethnic &UR;  &LR; Albanian rebels along the road,
other police units tried to enter rebel-controlled territory nearby
and were caught in ambushes that left two armored personnel
carriers destroyed and three officers wounded, government officials
said. The officials said rebels used a 120 mm &UR;  &LR; mortar in the
ambushes. Diplomats said the rebels conceded that this was true,
which means the rebels have much larger weaponry than had been
known.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller mortars were used in the combat on the main road, though
it was unclear which side was using them. Heavy machine-gun fire
poured from police units that commandeered a motel near the road.
The police appeared to push back the attackers after about a
half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that the rebels were in a mood to negotiate but
remained in their positions.
</P>
<P>
   There has been shooting in this area of northern Kosovo since
Thursday, when government forces tried to capture a village and the
regional headquarters of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   International monitors said police have been sniping at ethnic
Albanian civilians from the motel for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians, who constitute more than 90 percent of
Kosovo's population, want an independent country. The province is
part of Serbia, one of two republics remaining in Yugoslavia. The
government sent in soldiers and police units beginning last spring
to put down ethnic Albanian rebels. A cease-fire, negotiated with
Western aid in the hope of allowing villagers who had fled the
fighting to return home before winter, has been disintegrating into
violence recently.
</P>
<P>
   After the rebels repulsed the government attack on Thursday,
international monitors brokered a pact in which both sides agreed
to pull back their troops, but neither side seems to want to stop
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, rebels killed an elderly Serbian man in a village
near Podujevo, the largest town in the area. He was the
father-in-law of a local senior police official.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said he had been sniping at them from his home.
Sunday morning, as local Serbs were gathering for the man's
funeral, rebels shot and killed another elderly Serb, who they said
was also firing at them.
</P>
<P>
   With tensions growing, the monitors stationed in the local
headquarters of both rebel and government forces were called back
to brief senior monitors in Pristina. About 30 minutes after they
left, the fighting started.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said their men were trying to rescue the
elderly man shot Sunday when they were ambushed. A rebel leader
said the police came in to attack them.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign officials blamed Sunday's fighting, in part, on the
inexperience and insufficient number of the monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nobody to tell the KLA, `Relax, relax,''' a foreign
official said. ``If they go in and work the problem, it will calm
down.''
</P>
<P>
   As rebel fighters rushed into trenches to ambush government
forces near villages here, ethnic Albanian civilians, many of them
children, ran across the snow trying to avoid the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Villages in the area had been emptying as civilians fled to stay
with people in Podujevo. But Sunday, both ethnic Albanians and
Serbs were fleeing Podujevo. Nurije Kopalla, who had taken refugees
into her home after the fighting on Thursday, was desperately
trying Sunday to get a ride out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who was in my home is gone,'' she said. ``Some of
them ran to the mountains, some to other towns.''
</P>
<P>
   While trying to flee, she was trapped in the fighting on the
main road, but finally made it out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   During the weekend, rebels went to the homes of 13 Serbian
villagers and forced them to hand over weapons, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With the conflict worsening, a dispute over how much danger the
international monitors will accept appeared to deepen Sunday.
Monitors are here as part of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, a group made up of 53 countries, including
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials of the organization here say if the fighting
continues, it will become too dangerous for their unarmed monitors
to work. The leader of the organization, Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek of Poland, released a statement Sunday that reiterated that
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bloodshed and violence escalate, the OSCE will have to
reconsider the forms of its activity in Kosovo,'' the statement
said .
</P>
<P>
   But the United States insisted that the monitoring mission must
find a way to make conditions safe enough to stay. ``Leaving is not
American policy in Kosovo,'' a U.S. diplomat said late Sunday.
``We're going to stay there and finish the job.''

JETS DEFEAT PATRIOTS, 31-10 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GERALD EZKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New York Jets took the field before
a roaring crowd feeling like division champions _ the first time
they could say that in 29 years _ and then they went out on Sunday
and played as if they had been doing this sort of thing all their
professional lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets put an exclamation point to the regular season with a
31-10 trouncing of the New England Patriots, who were undermanned
because of injuries but still motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation didn't help. ``Nothing was redeemable,'' said
Patriots Coach Pete Carroll, who watched in frustration as Vinny
Testaverde tossed touchdowns to four different receivers and the
Jet defense sparkled against an overwhelmed Scott Zolak at
quarterback and a contained running game.
</P>
<P>
   After amassing a franchise-record 12th victory, the Jets (12-4)
now find themselves home for the next two weeks. When they play
next, in the divisional round on Jan. 10, they will meet either
Jacksonville, Buffalo or Miami. Essentially, the Jets are now one
victory away from going to the American Conference championship
game, which is 60 minutes away from the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a believer out of me today,'' said Coach Bill
Parcells. Each week he admits to more admiration for his club, the
third he has taken to the playoffs. But post-season in a Jets
uniform is unknown to all the current players except for Mo Lewis,
who appeared in the playoffs in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   What Parcells demanded from his team on Sunday, even though it
already had clinched a bye week and homefield advantage in their
first playoff game, was to play like a champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to win a championship one week and lay an egg
the next,'' explained center Kevin Mawae.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one knows how far this improbable Jets saga can
go. It has already come farther in two seasons than any team that
had a one-victory season has. But all the elements were in place on
Sunday for success in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, who now boasts a 12-1 record as the Jets' starter,
completed 17 of 27 passes for 179 yards. He threw scoring passes to
Kyle Brady, Curtis Martin, Dedric Ward and Keyshawn Johnson. They
lifted him beyond the Jets' record for touchdowns in a season
previously held by Al Dorow and Joe Namath. Testaverde now has 29.
</P>
<P>
   Martin rambled for 102 yards on 29 carries. He was helped along
the way by left guard Todd Burger, who completed a season without
being flagged with a holding penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the Patriots were never in the game, either because
they were overmatched due to injuries that sidelined quarterback
Drew Bledsoe, wide receiver Terry Glenn and others, or were simply
flat.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets controlled the ball for more than 17 of the first 20
minutes, jumped to a 17-0 lead, and then virtually sailed through
the rest of the way. It was a down performance by a Patriots' team
that could have had a homefield advantage in the wild-card game by
winning.
</P>
<P>
   But the only touchdown the Jets yielded _ it came with 91
seconds left on a Zolak bomb to Tony Simmons _ prevented the Jets
from leading the league in fewest points allowed. The Jets gave up
266 points, 1 more than the Dolphins. Last year's team allowed 454
points.
</P>
<P>
   After the opening kickoff, the Jets controlled the ball for a
remarkable 8 minutes 39 seconds as Testaverde connected on his
first four passes. He also scrambled once for 10 yards _ later in
the game he was to do it again for 25 _ and the Jets went on to
open the scoring on John Hall's 36-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   All the Pats could do was three-and-out, and this time the Jets
took 5:20 off the clock on a drive into the second quarter that
ended with a wide-open Brady cradling Testaverde's 4-yard toss.
</P>
<P>
   One drive later, Robert Edwards _ the man the Patriots had
drafted to replace Martin _ fumbled when Jason Ferguson wrapped him
up, and Ray Mickens recovered the ball.
</P>
<P>
   This time Testaverde took advantage of the turnover with a swing
pass to Martin, who turned it into an 8-yard score. The Patriots'
response was an Adam Vinatieri field goal that provided the only
scoring the Patriots managed until the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   What continued to unfold was an aggressive, confident Jet team
not taking it easy. Suddenly, the Jets are thinking of themselves
in the bigger picture. So even though most of them knew they would
not face New England in the divisional game in almost two weeks,
there is an outside chance they could face the Patriots in the
American Conference title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted this game for two reasons,'' explained linebacker
Bryan Cox, one of those players whose career might well have ended
if Parcells hadn't picked him up. ``One, we wanted to play like
champions. And two, we wanted to defeat a team who we might have to
play here again. We wanted them to know they can't come in here and
beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   This gave the Jets a 6-0 sweep of three divisional opponents _
the Patriots, Dolphins and Bills _ who are all playoff-bound.
</P>
<P>
   The game was virtually clinched in the third quarter, when
Testaverde lofted a 17-yarder to a diving Ward in the end zone, and
the diminutive receiver again caught a ball with outstretched arms.
He makes up for his 5-foot 9-inch-stature with this weekly ability
to snare balls seemingly beyond his grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The rout was complete when Testaverde hit Johnson with a 24-yard
pass early in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play New England, even in the parking lot,'' said
Johnson, who again led all receivers with 6 receptions for 75
yards.
</P>
<P>
   With such an imposing performance, no wonder the Jets' locker
room reverberated with cheering. They had won their fourth straight
game in December, which no Jet team had ever done. They were taking
a six-game winning streak into the playoffs. They seem to have run
out of bad history to erase. Of course, now they have to win a
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, they are the winningest club in Jets history.
Certainly, this meant something to Parcells?
</P>
<P>
   Later, snarling only once when asked what that 12th victory
meant, Parcells said: ``We've buried all the ghosts. If you want to
dig them up, you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, you do so at your own peril.

DISCOUNTED URNS AND NO OVERHEAD  
 GREETING CARDS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At age 35, Russel Harmon has made a career of shaking up the
funeral industry. In 1994, he founded Affordable Funeral Services,
a renegade discounter in an industry accustomed to markups ranging
from 300 percent to 1,000 percent and sometimes more. Two years
ago, he sold Affordable to Service Corporation International of
Houston and took a job as an executive there.
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ``I discovered that you can't be an entrepreneur
and a corporate type at the same time.'' The entrepreneur bug bit
hard last year when one of his employees at Service started a Web
site to sell cremation urns _ the containers that hold the ashes of
deceased people or pets _ directly to the bereaved.
</P>
<P>
   When Harmon failed to persuade Service to buy the Web site,
Discounturns.com, he left the company and bought the site himself.
Last week, he acquired his major competitor, Urnsdirect.com,
expanding his product line and vendors.
</P>
<P>
   As markdowns on vendors' suggested retail prices, his discounts
are relatively small, but they can be substantial when compared
with what funeral homes actually charge. For example, Discounturns
sells the Remembrance, a bronze urn with a recommended price of
$500, for $430, a 14 percent markdown. But it is sold by New York
City funeral directors for close to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon acknowledges that some people feel guilty about shopping
for a discount on an urn. ``Those aren't my customers,'' he said.
In fact, he has introduced a new product line of ``faux finish''
urns made of wood or fiberboard and painted to look like one of
seven hardwoods. The faux containers sell for as little as $29.95
and, he says with pride, have the added advantage of being
biodegradable _ a feature he is trying to patent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to brass and faux models, he offers assorted
hardwood, marble and ceramic urns, plus a line for pets.
</P>
<P>
   Cremation is increasingly popular, now accounting for about 35
percent of all disposal of human remains in the United States and
Canada _ ranging from 4 percent in Mississippi to 65 percent in
British Columbia, according to the Cremation Association of North
America.
</P>
<P>
   And the Internet, Harmon says, is the best way by far to market
urns. For one thing, he keeps no inventory, passing orders directly
to the manufacturers, who ship them to buyers. For another, he is a
Yahoo merchant, meaning that the big portal site takes all the
orders and processes all the credit-card transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overhead is next to nothing,'' Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is not rid of bricks and mortar altogether. He is
planning a crematory in Washington in which people will be able to
watch fire consume the remains of relatives from behind a glass
partition, if they choose, and even to ignite the flames. Such
features serve an increasingly multiethnic population, said Harmon,
who pointed out, for example, that in Hindu families tradition
calls for the oldest surviving son to light the funeral fire.

   Greeting Cards at Your Fingertips
</P>
<P>
   Felicia Lindau wants to help everyone whose new year's
resolution is to ``be a better friend'' and, in the process, make a
viable business. Amid this year's holiday bustle, she opened
Sparks.com, which she bills as the ``world's largest greeting card
store.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not fancy Hallmark as her competition. Rather, Ms.
Lindau would like to be the Amazon.com of cards. Her store is a Web
site, and it allows would-be senders of cheer, and other
sentiments, to browse through an online selection of more than
5,000 cards from hundreds of publishers. In contrast, industry data
show that the typical neighborhood card store carries 300 to 600
cards, usually from one major publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Variety, Ms. Lindau says, guarantees nuance. As evidence that no
occasion is too uncommon and no late 20th-century family situation
too obscure for the greeting card, she cites a holiday card for a
Christian woman and her Jewish husband.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members wearing rubber gloves at a San Francisco warehouse
pluck cards from shelves and mail them to the Web site's customers.
For an additional 75 cents a card, they sign them (by laser printer
or staff scribe) and mail them on the buyer's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   While the 17 minutes, on average, that a typical customer spends
browsing a card store might not be reduced by online shopping, Ms.
Lindau said, at least it can be done on the shopper's timetable, or
in pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of the ubiquitous digital communique, and with
hundreds of free electronic cards available on the Web, is it
counterintuitive to sell traditional paper cards on the Internet?
Before heading to the venture capitalists, she posed that question
to focus groups and found that ``there's very little overlap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The electronic card is good for novelty,'' she said, adding
that it gets you ``half credit'' if you have missed a birthday. But
``getting something in the mail just feels so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently that sentiment is widely shared. The Greeting Card
Association, an industry trade group based in Washington, predicts
a $1.2 billion rise in card sales from 1995 _ the first full year
of the Web's existence _ through 1998, when sales are expected to
reach $7.5 billion in the United States, a 19 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Marianne McDermott, executive director of the
association, sees the Internet as a threat _ not to card sales but
to penmanship. ``The subject of discussion isn't whether the
Internet is going to do away with paper,'' she said, ``but rather
that young people aren't writing anymore, because they're on the
computer. We're hoping that young people don't lose the art of
writing and communicating with handwritten notes.''

 &HT;    Falcons fly beyond expectations with win over Miami
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the chance the Atlanta Falcons' 14-2 record isn't
enough to spin heads from coast to coast, perhaps Sunday's 38-16
victory against the Miami Dolphins was enough to do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   The NFC West champion Falcons scored touchdowns on their first
plays in both halves, took leads of 21-0 and 38-6, forced six Miami
turnovers and were never threatened by a team that six days earlier
stymied the Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos, 31-21.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could have predicted Sunday. Nobody could have predicted
Atlanta would be just the sixth NFL team in the last 10 years to
win 14 or more games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't ever realistically go in thinking you're going to be
14-2, but we definitely had some momentum based on the way we
played at the end of last year,'' quarterback Chris Chandler said
when referring to the Falcons' 6-2 finish last season after a 1-7
start. ``Very few people in their NFL careers get this opportunity
for happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been a good game to rest key players in
anticipation of a home playoff game Jan. 9 against Dallas, Green
Bay or San Francisco, just like head coach Dan Reeves sat this one
out _ not counting his pre-game lecture to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who is recovering from heart by-pass surgery, gave his
speech and left.
</P>
<P>
   His team remained, and left the Dolphins in a heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said to us, 'Any time they're keeping score, the game
means something,''' Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami spent all but 24 seconds in the rear-view mirror of a
Falcons team that won its record-tying ninth straight game while
finishing the season undefeated at home for the first time in their
33 years. Atlanta is 20-4 since the middle of 1997, the best record
in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   When it ended, the team mascot, Freddie Falcon, bore a sign
reading, ``Miami Bound.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not meant for the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to the fact Super Bowl XXXIII will be
played in Miami in four weeks, and the Falcons are one of the
stronger candidates for participation.
</P>
<P>
   Such a thought is only a little more mind-boggling than the way
the game unfolded before a raucous sellout crowd of 69,754.
</P>
<P>
   Although Atlanta could gain nothing in terms of playoff
positioning with a victory, defensive end Lester Archambeau was the
only starter to take the day off because of complications with a
broken thumb.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like Miami (10-6) was playing the scrubs.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play, Chandler faked a handoff to Jamal Anderson,
and rolled right. He passed to tight end O.J. Santiago, who ran 62
yards for a touchdown. Santiago, a second-year player, added a
3-yard touchdown pass with 11:08 to play, and the rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler left the game after that play after straining his lower
back, but he said afterward that the injury isn't serious.
</P>
<P>
   On the Dolphins' next possession, quarterback Dan Marino was
intercepted by Falcons cornerback Ronnie Bradford, who ran 11 yards
to give the Falcons a 21-0 lead with 7:00 left in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Game over.
</P>
<P>
   For all the fuss made before the season of how this team's
success was predicated on the health of Chandler, the Falcons are
4-1 in games he missed or left with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they were 0-6 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta outscored Miami 24-16 with Steve DeBerg at quarterback.
DeBerg, 44, completed five of 10 passes for 85 yards, including a
35-yard touchdown pass to Tony Martin on the Falcons' first play of
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   That was good for a 31-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After a Miami fumble, Anderson, who rushed for 103 yards to
finish with 1,846 for the season, ran 36 yards for a touchdown and
a 38-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear what role Reeves will have this week or in the
week before the playoff game. He probably will make several
appearances at team headquarters in Suwanee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably snuck out of the house,'' free safety Eugene
Robinson said when referring to the pre-game talk. ``He probably
told his wife (Pam), he was going to take out the garbage. We told
him, 'Go home. We don't need you now; we need you for the
playoffs.''''
</P>
<P>
   As evidenced on Sunday, the garbage of 25 non-winning seasons
appears to have been carried out of the Georgia Dome. Some people
are not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence in this locker room from the beginning of last
year to now is a complete opposite,'' center Robbie Tobeck said.
``It's been great to be part of the change, to see the guys coming
together. This team is just a bunch of hard-working guys,
blue-collar guys, really, guys coming out of nowhere to play great
football. It's been a very special, fun year.''

TESTAVERDE IS THE LIFE OF JETS' PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Even before the kickoff, it was already
the best party that all those formerly frustrated New York Jets'
followers have ever had, a Sunday without stress.
</P>
<P>
   With the Jets assured of first place, the burgers and the beer
tasted better in the parking lot, and as 74,302 stood to cheer the
introductions, hundreds, if not thousands, of all those formerly
frustrated followers were dressed better in their green jerseys
with ``Chrebet'' and ``K. Johnson'' and ``Lewis'' and ``Martin'' on
the back.
</P>
<P>
   Especially those with ``Testaverde'' on the back.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other Jet, quarterback Vinny Testaverde was the
life of Sunday's party with four touchdown passes as the Jets
soared toward the Super Bowl XXXIII playoffs with a 31-10 rout of
the Patriots. But that was only fitting. More than any other Jet,
he has been the life of the team.
</P>
<P>
   And looking to the Jan. 10 divisional playoff at Giants Stadium,
coach Bill Parcells said, ``I'm leaning on Testaverde.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaning hard. You can't win in the National Football League
without a quality quarterback. After all those dubious seasons in
Tampa Bay and Cleveland and Baltimore, the 35-year-old Testaverde
is now a quality quarterback with a quality record: in his 13
starts, the Jets are 12-1.
</P>
<P>
   Over the season, Testaverde's passing stats are 259 completions
in 421 attempts for 3,256 yards, 29 touchdowns and only seven
interceptions _ the fourth best touchdown-to-interception season
ratio in NFL history behind Steve DeBerg, Bart Starr and Steve
Bartkowski.
</P>
<P>
   Those 29 touchdown passes set a franchise record, surpassing the
26 thrown by both Al Dorow of the original 1960 Titans and by Joe
Namath in 1967 around the time when Testaverde, then a youngster in
Elmont, Long Island, put Broadway Joe's photo on his bedroom wall
in the family home.
</P>
<P>
   But when Testaverde was asked about breaking the record shared
by Namath, he talked about how Namath played in a ``different
time,'' how ``it's been a dream season,'' and how ``I'm enjoying
everything, but I'm not one to talk about it.'' Maybe he still
reveres Namath too much.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks are rated on how many correct decisions they make _
when and where to throw a pass, when and where not to throw a pass,
when to throw it away, when to take a sack, when to scramble. And
when Parcells was asked to assess Testaverde, he talked about those
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making the prudent choice,'' the coach said. ``He's using
good judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Testaverde was deemed expendable by the Baltimore
Ravens in late June, he had a career decision to make. In addition
to the Jets, the Seattle Seahawks and the Cincinnati Bengals wanted
to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I made one right decision all year long,'' he said, ``it
was the decision to come to play for Bill Parcells.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, however, Parcells was saying that Glenn Foley would
``get the benefit of the doubt'' at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a good feeling about it, even when the coach told
me Glenn would be the starter,'' Testaverde recalled. ``For the
first time, I was going to be around players and coaches from this
area. And for me to be home with my family and friends made it all
the more enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde waited his turn, and when Foley sputtered and his
turn came, he made the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it with professional preparation,'' said Dan Henning,
the Jets' quarterback coach. ``He's meticulous. He was mad at
himself today for throwing that one interception. He knew he made a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In guiding the Jets to their first 12-victory season, Testaverde
hasn't made many mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a leader,'' said Keyshawn Johnson, the Pro Bowl wide
receiver with 10 touchdown receptions. ``He knows exactly what he's
looking for. He's aware of the reads. He throws a hard ball, but
it's very accurate. Because he throws it so hard, it can get
through a particular defender.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Byars, now a Jets fullback, has been in the NFL throughout
Testaverde's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched Vinny a long time and the difference now is night
and day,'' Byars said. ``He has so much more confidence and poise.
He's a leader in the huddle and on the sideline. He quit making
this harder than what it is and learned to use the people around
him. He's going to throw the ball to whoever's open.''
</P>
<P>
   And 29 times this season ``throwing the ball to whoever's open''
has produced a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to throw to Curtis Martin and Keith Byars, to
Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward made a big
difference for me,'' Testaverde said. ``Get them the ball and let
them do the work.''
</P>
<P>
   But in any passing attack, the quarterback has to do the work
first. And if he does it well enough for a 12-1 record as a
starter, he's the life of the party.
</P>

 By SUZANNE DALEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGCINGWANA, South Africa _ South Africa's deputy president,
Thabo Mbeki, earned his degree in economics from the University of
Sussex in England and is rarely seen in anything less formal than a
double-breasted suit and a silk tie.
</P>
<P>
   But this weekend, Mbeki, the man who is virtually certain of
becoming South Africa's next president, traveled to this remote,
rural village where he was raised and where his mother still runs
the local store in a room about the size of a garage.
</P>
<P>
   Here, where the houses and huts are separated by dirt paths _
often clogged with cows and sheep _ and the fields stretch unbroken
over the hilly horizon, South Africans got to see a slightly
different Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
   He wore a single strand of his tribal beads over an open necked
shirt. And, as is traditional in his Xhosa tribe, he sat with the
village elders in his mother's cattle pen, drinking home-brewed
beer and barbecuing freshly slaughtered meat.
</P>
<P>
   A question about who Mbeki is still hangs in the air in South
Africa. In recent months, he has appeared to be making an effort to
provide an answer. It would be difficult for any man to come out
from behind President Nelson Mandela's shadow. But it is perhaps
even harder for Mbeki than it might be for others because he lived
in exile for more than 30 years and is clearly ill-at-ease in the
public eye.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's events, including a feast for thousands of
villagers, was a way of showing South Africans who remain somewhat
suspicious of him that his roots are indeed here along South
Africa's southeast coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will see him in this place,'' said Smuts Ngonyama, the
director of information for the governing African National
Congress, ``and they will know that he is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The expedition to his home town also made it possible for Mbeki,
56, to remind South Africans of his own credentials in the struggle
for South Africa, even if they do not reach the stature of
Mandela's 27 years in prison. The Mbeki family was deeply involved
in the anti-apartheid movement, and several of Mbeki's family
members _ including a brother _ disappeared and are presumed to
have been killed by the police.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the deputy president has been running the
day-to-day affairs of the country for several years now, and last
year he became the president of the governing party, the African
National Congress. Since the party is expected to win the next
year's elections easily, Mbeki is expected to become president of
the country. But the party is hoping for a very large majority, and
so Mbeki's image counts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Mbeki's obvious prominence in the party, it is Mandela
who is always in the headlines. His touch with the people has
produced an abundance of heart-warming pictures as he hugs children
and beauty queens and greets celebrities and heads of state. Mbeki,
however, appears to have no such touch.
</P>
<P>
   He is cerebral and stiff _ South Africa's version of Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, however, he has been going public in his own way.
Earlier this month, a collection of Mbeki's speeches was published,
called, ``Africa, The Time Has Come.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki spent years as a speech writer for the African National
Congress, and even if his delivery tends to be uninspired, some of
his speeches have been memorable, rising almost into poetry. He is
famous throughout South Africa for a speech everyone calls the ``I
am an African'' speech, which uses that line as a refrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an African,'' it begins. ``I owe my being to the hills
and the valleys, the mountains and the glades, the rivers, the
deserts, the trees, the flowers, the seas and the ever changing
seasons that define the the face of our native land.'' The speech
he gave to Parliament on the day South Africa passed its new
constitution in 1996 ends with, ``Nothing can stop us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki also spoke out last month on a special television
broadcast about AIDS. Although Mandela had been scheduled to speak,
it was Mbeki who showed up. His tense demeanor got the better of
him, though. Seated in a chair surrounded by a group of
rambunctious young children, he did not move a muscle during his
entire 15-minute speech _ even to pat a youngster who was hugging
his legs and gazing adoringly into his face.
</P>
<P>
   Most often Mbeki, who is married but has no children, is
described as a workaholic. Indeed, during the hours of speeches and
traditional dancing and singing in honor of Mbeki on Sunday,
Mandela came over from his own rural village where he vacations to
say hello and to tweak his deputy for working too hard.
</P>
<P>
   While Mbeki had entered the huge white tent set up in a field
with a slight smile and a wave, Mandela stopped to shake hands with
the crowd, as he usually does. Still, Mbeki managed a small dance
with a young woman from the choir who invited him off the dais.
</P>
<P>
   When it was Mbeki's turn at the microphone, he told a few small
jokes, but quickly got down to business. In the briefest speech of
the day, he told the crowd that some South Africans do not know
what to do with their new-found freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Some, Mbeki said, believe that freedom means they can rape and
steal other people's property. Some believe that freedom means they
do not have to go to work. Some teachers, he said, are showing up
at school drunk and some police officers are corrupt and even ANC
officials were lining their pockets. ``Something is amiss here,''
he said, before leaving the podium. ``We shall note all this next
year and change our patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his call at the end for everyone to eat, drink and be
merry, his speech received a muted response.

 &HT;    Bailey center of attention at Peach Bowl press conference
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like he surely will be Thursday when Virginia and
Georgia meet in the Georgia Dome, Champ Bailey was the center of
attention at the Peach Bowl's first joint press conference Sunday
at the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia sportwriters in town to cover the bowl were
particularly fascinated by the Georgia junior's ability to stay on
the field for practically every play of every game. Bailey, who
starts both at cornerback and wide receiver, played more than 100
plays in six of the Bulldogs' 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he does it,'' said Virginia coach George
Welsh. ``I think it's remarkable. We've had some players we thought
about doing it with in the past, but it's so hard just to practice
both ways. We tried that with Ronde' Barber a few years ago but
never did it in a game. I think it's remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia coach Jim Donnan was asked if he thought it endangered
Bailey by playing him so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we played him enough,'' he said. ``It's a
mistake every time we take him out of the game because it hurts us.
... He's easily the best all-around player in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Welsh said the Cavaliers would make no special arrangements to
deal with Bailey on offense, where he has caught 47 passes for 744
yards and seven touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't key on him; he's not a tailback,'' Welsh said.
``They run so many different formations and do so many things to
get the ball to him, we just have to play zone or man-to-man and
hope everybody executes.''
</P>
<P>
   What they're playing for
</P>
<P>
   Virginia will be shooting for 10 wins, an accomplishment matched
by only the 1989 team in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10 wins is the thing I'm thinking about,'' said junior
running back Thomas Jones, who leads the Cavaliers with 1,303 yards
rushing and 13 TDs. ``Ten wins is a great season for any team.
Plus, it gives us something we can build on for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia looks to rebound after a 21-19 last-second loss to
Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you lose a game like we did to Georgia Tech, it's
tough to swallow,'' Donnan said. ``This game can give us some juice
going into the off-season and for recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   They said it
</P>
<P>
   Welsh on the differences in the '95 Georgia team the Cavaliers
defeated 34-27 three years ago and the one his team will face
Thursday: ``Georgia has learned how to win again, I'd say that's
the biggest difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan on lineman Keith Stephens' late arrival from Columbus:
``He said he had a flat tire, but I think it's because he's been
eating too much. He probably drove the air out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia QB Quincy Carter on his remarkable freshman season:
``Dropping the ball off to Champ and watching him run 80 yards is
not too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan on the stress-free environment of a bowl game: ``When you
live in this state you don't get a chance to be stress-free. We're
on a one-game losing streak.''
</P>
<P>
   All-America matchup
</P>
<P>
   One of the best matchups of the Peach Bowl will feature Georgia
tackle Matt Stinchcomb against Virginia defensive end Patrick
Kerney. Both are first-team All-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Kerney, a 6-6, 265-pound senior, came to Virginia on a lacrosse
scholarship in 1995 but gave that up in order to walk on with the
football team. He tied former Virginia All-American Chris Slade for
quarterback sacks in a season with 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb will leave Georgia as one of the Bulldogs' most
decorated players of all time. The 6-6, 291-pound senior began the
season as a Playboy preseason All-American, was a finalist for the
Lombardi Award and won the SEC's Jacobs Blocking Trophy, which
annually goes to the league's top lineman.
</P>
<P>
   What's next
</P>
<P>
   Georgia and Virginia will practice again this morning, the
Bulldogs at Marist High School and the Cavaliers at Georgia Tech.
After another media conference at the Chamber of Commerce, the
teams will visit local children's hospitals this afternoon. The
Bulldogs will go to Scottish Rite and Virginia will go to Egleston.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling right at home
</P>
<P>
   Virginia is undefeated in three trips to the Peach Bowl. The
Cavaliers beat a Purdue team led by Jim Everett and Rod Woodson
27-24 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium in 1984 and defeated Georgia
34-27 at the Georgia Dome in 1995. ... Virginia has played a game
in Atlanta five of the last six years. The Cavaliers are 11-9
all-time in Atlanta and 3-0 against the Bulldogs. However, they
lost a 41-38 heartbreaker to Georgia Tech on their last trip to the
city on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Big-time players
</P>
<P>
   NFL draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. said more future pro football
players will be in action in the Peach Bowl than in the Fiesta
Bowl. He claimed Virginia and Georgia could field up to 17 draft
picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fiesta Bowl may have the best teams but their talent is
young. If I could go to any bowl, I'd book my ticket for Atlanta,''
he said.

AN AGENT FINDS HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NBA LOCKOUT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a charity exhibition game in Atlantic City, N.J., 10 days
ago, a half-dozen reporters surrounded Dan Wasserman, the
communications director for the National Basketball Players
Association, to find out where his boss, executive director Billy
Hunter, was sitting.
</P>
<P>
   With a group of sheepish all-star players trying to patch their
tattered public image, the state of the union was at issue. Were
the players still united? Would the owners dare to scrap the entire
season? And exactly what kind of outside influence is a certain
prominent agent exerting on negotiations?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it true,'' a reporter asked Wasserman, ``that David Falk is
running this . . . game?''
</P>
<P>
   Falk, the agent for a fleet of superstars, including Patrick
Ewing and Michael Jordan, has been likened to a puppeteer during
the league's six-month-old labor dispute _ pulling the strings of
Hunter, his clients on the negotiating committee and, essentially,
doing all he can to ruin professional basketball in America.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Falk had co-promoted the game. And after weathering a
tidal wave of criticism for originally wanting 90 percent of the
proceeds to go to ``needy'' NBA players, he and the organizers
switched gears and gave all of the nearly $1 million to local and
national charities. But if the players were on the defensive, so
was the man who brought them there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become a common target,'' Falk said. ``I don't like it. I
guess the alternative is that I could have a very low profile. But
that's not what our players want. They don't want us to hide, like
some of these other people. I think it was Dante who said the
hottest places in hell are for those who, in a moment of crisis,
remain neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   With less than two weeks to reach a settlement before Stern will
recommend to the owners to cancel the season, Falk's relationship
with the union is perceived by league officials to be one of the
reasons the two sides cannot reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The officials believe Falk's fear of having the league's highest
salaries capped will cut into his power base so severely that the
agent has greatly influenced the union's entrenched negotiating
position.
</P>
<P>
   Though Falk has many middle-tier players among his 40 clients,
he is clear about one issue: the marquee players are the essence of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman away
from the Bulls, and what do you have?'' Falk asks, before
answering, ``a team that might not win the CBA. You take Stephon
Marbury and Kevin Garnett and Tom Gugliotta away from Minnesota and
what do you have left? Not much.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments back up Stern's charges of manipulation, and Falk
has admitted he strongly advises Ewing, the union president, and
his other clients on the committee _ Alonzo Mourning, Juwan Howard
and Dikembe Mutombo _ about the collective bargaining process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I see Patrick say something, it's almost like
watching the Energizer bunny,'' said the agent Harold MacDonald,
who represents Derrick Coleman and Terry Mills. ``I'm just waiting
for Falk to put in another battery, and off Patrick goes again.
Hardly any influence? Give me a break.''
</P>
<P>
   But how much pull does Falk really have? Some union officials
liken Falk to a dissenting mother at a PTA meeting, the quirky mom
who can't seem to get anyone else to look at the world in the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, Falk's ideas are not the ideas of the union,''
said Ron Klempner, a union lawyer. ``To not use his experience
would be foolish. He's great at what he does. But the problem with
David is, sometimes he thinks he can make the arguments more
eloquently than the next person, unaware that some of those
arguments have been made over and over already.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Falk claims he often goes days without speaking to
union officials. ``I wish I had the influence people think I do,''
he said. ``And I don't see anything wrong with the influence I do
have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Jeff Mishkin preventing David Stern from signing an
agreement?'' he asked, referring to the league's chief legal
counsel. ``When Bill Gates testifies before the justice department,
he has an army of lawyers to accompany him. But when players have
lawyers and agents and advisers, people attack them for not being
intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not troubled when people say I'm Patrick Ewing and Michael
Jordan's mouthpiece, because that statement is born out of
ignorance. What is insulting is for the media to suggest that
Michael Jordan is Howdy Doody.''
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Hunter who requested anonymity said the union
chief rarely speaks to the agent, and he wonders if some of Falk's
public statements have hurt the union more than helped it.
</P>
<P>
   The day the charity game was announced, Falk and some players
began defending the notion of proceeds going to cash-strapped
players, a move that backfired.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried very hard to keep public actions and comments of
owners and players alike down to a minimum,'' said one league
official on condition of anonymity. ``With one press conference,
Falk turned the apathy of the lockout into a visceral reaction
against our players. Remember, we have to sell this league when
this is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk admits that the original idea of giving 90 percent of the
proceeds to the financially crimped players and 10 percent to
charity was a mistake, the same way he said Stern imposing the
lockout was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it wasn't illogical to do something to help them out,''
Falk said. ``The owners have a tremendous financial cushion from
the networks. Where is the players' cushion?''
</P>
<P>
   Falk is not sure why he has become so unpopular during the
lockout, surmising that Stern uses him as a scapegoat so he does
not have to publicly excoriate Hunter. ``For obvious reasons,''
Falk said, the inference being that Falk, as the white,
loose-cannon agent, was more politically correct to blast in the
media than the black union executive director. When asked if that
is how he felt, Falk replied, ``That's an interesting theory.
Nobody's written about that yet.'' He also sees himself as one of
the union's lone messengers of truth, trying to stave off the NBA's
propaganda monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players union has one young man doing p.r., while the NBA
has a well-oiled machine churning all the time,'' Falk said. ``I'm
not promoting myself. I'm promoting players' position. I don't like
it. There are people who love the fight. I don't. I don't relish
the contest. At the same time, you can't be reluctant to engage.
That's the price we pay for the guys we represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Martyr or megalomaniac, some of the backlash he has received
recently may have nothing to do with the lockout. Falk can
sometimes alienate almost as well as he can negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   The same flippant arrogance that has caused NBA general managers
to curse Falk's name does not always go over well with the public,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Callers to the Washington office, of FAME _ Falk Associates
Management Enterprises _ are often forwarded to his
self-aggrandizing voicemail. This month's offering:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, this is David, with my end of the year message:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just weeks before Christmas and all through the halls,
not a creature was stirring, there was no basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while
visions of Jordan danced in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``And mama had a scowl and daddy a pout, 'cause their favorite
players were all locked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern was not amused, saying: ``Billy Hunter is not having fun
during this lockout. I am not having fun during this lockout. But I
see David Falk, and there he is on `Nightline' and on `Larry King
Live.' I don't know how, but he seems to be enjoying the
lockout.'' &QL;

<P>
   Syl Apps, the Hall of Fame center of the Toronto Maple Leafs
when they dominated the National Hockey League in the 1940s and one
of Canada's finest all-around athletes of his era, died Dec. 24 at
his home in Kingston, Ontario. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   In his 10 years in the NHL, Apps had 201 goals and 231 assists
and was renowned for his gentlemanly play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apps is the cleanest player I've ever known,'' said his coach,
Hap Day. ``He never bends an elbow except to twist his stick over
an opponent's wrist. The strongest language he ever uses is `by
hum' and `jiminy Christmas.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Conn Smythe, the Leafs' general manager, would introduce him at
gatherings as ``Syl Apps, our captain, who does not smoke or
drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Apps once flattened a Boston Bruin defenseman who had knocked
out two of his teeth with his stick, but he proved that players did
not have to fight in order to win. In the 1941-42 season, when he
won the Lady Byng Trophy for sportsmanship and did not incur a
single penalty, he was a first-team all-star and a runner-up for
the Hart Trophy as most valuable player. And he led the Maple Leafs
to their first Stanley Cup championship in 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Joseph Sylvanus Apps, a native of Paris, Ontario, also
excelled in football and track and field. He was captain of the
football team at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario,
graduating in 1936, and was the British Empire pole-vault champion
in 1934 and the sixth-place finisher in that event in the 1936
Olympic Games in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Apps won the first Calder Trophy, as the NHL's top rookie, in
the 1936-37 season. An agile skater although a 6-foot 210-pounder,
he led the league in assists, with 29, in each of his first two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Canadian Army in World War II, Apps led the
Maple Leafs to Stanley Cups in 1947 and 1948, then retired. He
finished with a flourish, passing the 200-goal mark in his final
regular-season game, against the Detroit Red Wings, when he scored
three goals, a hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   Apps was a five-time all-star with 432 career points but only 56
penalty minutes, and he was perhaps fortunate that in his later
years he played on a line with Wild Bill Ezinicki, a legendary
tough guy. Apps was given a misconduct penalty, in a game against
Montreal in February 1947, for leaving the bench to enter a fight.
But that penalty was expunged by the NHL president, Clarence
Campbell, who ruled that ``Apps did not leave the bench until after
the play was stopped and took no part in the altercation.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era when Maple Leaf Gardens was a citadel of hockey, Apps
served as the captain on Toronto teams that also had stars like
centers Ted Kennedy and Max Bentley and goalie Turk Broda. Apps was
elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   He ran unsuccessfully for the Canadian parliament in the spring
of 1940 when he sandwiched campaign speeches between hockey games.
After retiring as a player, he served as Ontario's athletic
commissioner, was a Conservative member of the Ontario Legislature
from 1963 to 1974 and was minister of correctional services in the
Ontario cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his wife, Mary; two sons, Syl Jr., who
played in the NHL, with the Rangers, Penguins and Kings, and Robert
Apps; and three daughters, Joanne, Carol and Janet. A grandson, Syl
Apps 3rd, is a center for the Princeton University hockey team.
Another grandson, Darren Barber, won a gold medal with the Canadian
eight-oars rowing squad at the 1992 Olympics.

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   It's ooh ride time again, or aah, if you prefer _ the name
derived from children's oohs and aahs as they pass one sparkling
residential sensation after another. Some blocks are more suitable
for this purpose than others. Those with the most holiday
decorations take the Christmas pudding, and the best time for an
ooh ride is between Christmas and New Year.
</P>
<P>
   The practical approach is to cruise up and down the flashiest
suburban or urban streets and determine the rating of the area by
the number of oohs added to the exclamations.
</P>
<P>
   The ooh rides can become a delightful expedition, but oohing
must be the sole purpose of the outing. Viewing lights and
ornaments en route to somewhere else doesn't count.

   Lucille Waldman was busy navigating the holiday crowds on
Madison Avenue in the vicinity of F.A.O. Schwarz. As she waited for
the light to change, she didn't know whether to be pleased to be a
native New Yorker, or whether she was fair game. An intrepid dog
walker was admonishing his dog: ``And don't bite any tourists!''
</P>

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Walking on the Upper West Side, I saw this tiny lady _ an old
70, I'd guess _ in this incredible dress. It was cotton pique with
large flowers on it in a wonderful range of colors _ and each
covered button was a different color.
</P>
<P>
   I said to her, ``Great dress,'' and she said, ``Thank you.''
Then she came close to me and said: ``A Saks Fifth Avenue dress _ I
got it for $3. At my age, I need to economize. I bought it at a
thrift store. I'm not long for this world.'' She pointed to a woman
wearing a very tight, stretchy dress with a visible panty line
clinging to an enormous behind. ``When I see a dress like that, it
hastens my end,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I asked her how she found her great dress. ``People ask me for
advice all the time, but I need to keep it to myself,'' she said,
making her hands into fists and placing them on her heart. ``I need
it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   A young man walked by, and she pointed him out to me. ``He held
open the door for me in my building once. I remember people who are
kind to me.'' She then continued as if we had known each other a
long time. ``I can feel my end coming. I'm not myself. I ran into a
friend at the laundromat recently and she said, `Lil, what's
wrong?' I know I don't look like myself. I've been around here long
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   I told her I hoped not, because we needed her to wear great
dresses in New York. She said, ``Thank you for your compliment.'' I
wished her the best of luck, and we parted ways.

   Chris Boneau was showing Texas relatives the town. When he got
out of a cab with them, he realized he had left behind the
expensive camera he had bought in Tokyo. The cab had driven off,
and he had no receipt.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, he was in his apartment bemoaning his loss
when his friend Benedicta Pollock walked in and announced excitedly
that she had taken a cab and found this terrific camera in the back
seat. ``That's my camera!'' Chris cried as he tore it from her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that remains is to see if his relatives' images are on
the film when it's developed. If not, he said, the camera goes to
the Taxi and Limousine Commission. But in his own mind, he's
certain the pictures will be there and the camera is his. His
relatives believe that these things happen all the time in New
York, but he knows, he said, that ``this is, after all, the season

   A man I know recently found himself doing some lunch-hour
holiday shopping at the Victoria's Secret at South Street Seaport.
His rather conservative selections were carefully packed and placed
in a large shopping bag. To his dismay, the bag was quite the
opposite of the proverbial plain brown bag _ it was brightly
colored, with Victoria's Secret emblazoned across the side. He
shuddered at the idea of returning to the office with it, but was
informed that it was the only style of bag the store carried.
</P>
<P>
   As he emerged, imagining the snickers and titters as he walked
down the long hall to his office, past secretary after secretary,
he noticed a Foot Locker store next door. Inspired, he walked in
and approached a saleswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' he began, ``would you by any chance have ...''
``You want a bag,'' she interrupted, laughing, looking at the
Victoria's Secret bag. ``Exactly,'' he responded, with surprise and
relief. As he thanked her for the bag and turned to leave, she
shook her head and asked, ``Why is it that every guy walks out of
Victoria's Secret and comes in here asking for a Foot Locker bag?''

he's going to release it very soon.''

 &HT;    Jackson dives into the fray for first time since injury
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Notre Dame quarterback Jarious Jackson,
who's fighting his way back from a partially torn medial collateral
knee ligament, saw his first action in full pads on Sunday since he
injured the knee Nov. 21 against LSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The knee) feels great now,'' Jackson said. ``I'm doing
basically everything I want to, everything I feel comfortable
doing. Things I don't feel comfortable doing, I'll be gradually
working toward in the next couple days.''
</P>
<P>
   What he's not doing much of yet is sprinting and not running the
option. If he's unable to do either in the Gator Bowl, it will
severely limit his strengths, since he, like Georgia Tech
quarterback Joe Hamilton, is most dangerous because of his
quickness and versatility. But on Sunday, Jackson and his coach
were feeling good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let him loose,'' coach Bob Davie said. ``He had bodies
flying around and he was involved in some slight collisions. I
think from a confidence standpoint, it had to help him. I know his
teammates' confidence rose because it looks like he's going to be
able to play. But once again, it's still a day-to-day situation.
It's how he responds after this practice if he comes back tomorrow
and has no setbacks, no swelling, I think he'll be able to play on
Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar surroundings
</P>
<P>
   Gator Bowl practice surroundings may feel surreal for most of
the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, but not for sophomore receiver Dez
White.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on a high school stadium field at the Bolles School _
among the palm trees and the stucco _ in front of a bench painted
Florida Gator blue and orange that says ``Welcome to Bulldog
Country,'' it all feels normal for White. Except maybe he feels
like playing soccer instead of football.
</P>
<P>
   White attended Bolles, where he was a standout in both soccer
and football. It's a short drive from his home in Orange Park, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my teammates complain about the grass and
shinsplints, but I feel at home, comfortable with the field,'' said
White, who explained that the grass at Bolles is thicker and the
surface softer than the fields at Tech. ``I guess things never
change.''
</P>
<P>
   The school had put up a banner over the breezeway on the home
side of the stadium welcoming Bolles graduates White and Mike
Verlander, a freshman walk-on safety. White also said his mother
Desiree received a letter from Bolles president Harry Demontmollin
saying how proud he was White came through the Bolles program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know we have that kind of support,'' said White,
who should expect more of the same at Alltel Stadium on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   More Irish injuries
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame received bad news Sunday when senior offensive guard
Jerry Wisne (6 feet 7, 298 pounds) aggravated a knee injury in
practice. Wisne suffered a similar injury to Jackson's _ a
partially torn MCL _ but was a week farther along in his recovery
since his injury occurred Nov. 14 against Navy. Davie will hold
Wisne out of practice today and Tuesday and re-evaluate him on
Tuesday. Junior Mike Gandy (6-4, 296) replaced Wisne in the
starting lineup against LSU and Southern Cal and would do the same
against Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Punt returner Joey Getherall, a sophomore, has suffered a
strained hamstring and is questionable. Getherall is averaging 7.8
yards on 20 returns, including a 68-yarder against Navy.
</P>
<P>
   If he's unable to go, Notre Dame would likely have to rely on
tailback Autry Denson, a move the Irish don't want to make given
his importance.
</P>
<P>
   Denson, who averages 106 yards rushing and leads the Irish with
15 touchdowns, is the key to Notre Dame's offense, especially
considering Jackson's status.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as the Soviet Union was ending its confrontation with the
West in the late 1980s, the military officers who ran Moscow's
secretive germ warfare program ordered up new, much deadlier arms.
</P>
<P>
   At a remote laboratory complex in Kazakhstan, Russian scientists
began animal testing of the Marburg virus, a highly contagious germ
that kills by attacking every organ and tissue in the body.
</P>
<P>
   This secret testing, described recently by several veterans of
the Soviet program, went undetected at the time by Western
intelligence agencies, which knew few specifics about the plant's
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan gave up nuclear, biological and chemical weapons soon
after it became independent, and permitted American experts and a
handful of reporters to visit the plant. From their observations,
and from Soviet defectors, the West has finally learned what was
unfolding there in the final years of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The belated discovery of this exotic arms research is one of the
elements of a fierce dispute in Washington over whether the Russian
military is heeding President Boris Yeltsin's 1992 order to abandon
germ warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Similar uncertainties loom about Iraq. With the apparent end of
United Nations inspections, the West is now trying to track
Baghdad's germ work with satellites and, perhaps, spies _ the same
methods that failed to unmask the Soviet program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials contend that Russia no longer
poses a major threat. Western experts have visited most of its key
civilian laboratories, and officials disclosed that Russia had
recently moved closer to allowing Western experts to visit its
closed military installations, a crucial step that could dispel
many of the lingering doubts about Moscow's activities.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials assert that much of what they now
understand about the Soviet Union's germ weapons has been gleaned
through Western aid programs designed to foster peaceful research
projects. Those projects also pay salaries to former germ
scientists, fending off what officials say is the gravest danger
from the Soviet program _ recruitment of scientists by rogue states
or terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But some administration officials and Republicans in Congress
assert that Russia is still secretly researching germ weapons, just
as it did in the Cold War. Congress recently cut spending on the
cooperative exchanges with Russian germ scientists from $14 million
to $7 million, both because of persistent doubts about Russian
intentions and to punish Moscow for selling nuclear and missile
technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The debate turns partly on history. After developing germ
weapons for several decades, the United States and Russia signed an
international treaty in 1972 banning such arms. Almost immediately,
Soviet defectors say, Moscow secretly redoubled its germ research
and production.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and lawmakers acknowledge that there is scant hard
evidence to support their suspicions that Russia is cheating again,
but point to Moscow's reluctance to open up its military bases as
an ominous sign.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. Two weeks ago, the officials said, a small
group of Pentagon experts and senior defense scientists met their
Russian counterparts for the first time at the Military Academy of
Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense, a once-closed
military training institute in Tambov, some 300 miles southeast of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   High on the agenda were possible scientific exchanges that may
provide direct Western access to Russia's biological ``holy of
holies,'' as one official put it, four military installations at
the heart of the Russian germ empire _ Sergiyev Posad, Kirov,
Yekaterinburg (Sverdlosk), and Strizhi, none of which has been
visited by the West.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the military teams had agreed in principle to a
series of military exchanges, starting in the United States
sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a long process,'' said an official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But the ice has finally been
broken, and it's now clear that both of us want to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough is potentially significant. Iraq's entire germ
arsenal contained enough deadly poison at its peak to kill all the
people on earth many times over, according to U.N. weapons
inspectors. Yet, the Iraqi program was dwarfed by the amount and
variety of weapons the Soviet Union had secretly amassed.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets, as suggested by their research on the lethality of
the Marburg virus, were racing ahead in their final days to develop
entirely new classes of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 60,000 scientists and experts at work, they were
also developing compounds that could control human moods, heart
rhythms and sleep patterns and that could be used to destroy an
enemy army. Among the many unanswered questions, American officials
say, is where such work stands today.

 UNDATED: stands today. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stepnogorsk, in Kazakhstan, was the only major Soviet germ
installation outside the Russian heartland. Called the Scientific
Experimental and Production Base, it was known only by its post
office box, No. 2076.
</P>
<P>
   While Western intelligence analysts had deduced from the
configuration of the buildings that it was designed to produce
anthrax or other bacteriological agents, they never figured out
precisely what kind of research was being done, what weapons the
factory was making or what threat it posed.
</P>
<P>
   Built on a huge scale on a desolate, wind-blown steppe of
Central Asia, it is an eerie place to visit. The security fences
are no longer electrified. Air locks hang open. Plastic floor
covers installed to ease decontamination are torn and buckling from
neglect and the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Six stories high and two football fields long, the central
factory there is filled with 10 giant fermentation vats, each meant
to brew 5,000 gallons of anthrax microbes _ enough to kill every
man, woman and child in America many times over. Iraq's entire germ
production could have just about fit into one of these vats. And
Stepnogorsk was only one of six such Soviet plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see, we haven't made that in some time.'' Gennadi
L. Lepyoshkin, the base's director, told Pentagon experts and a
reporter who recently walked through the anthrax plant, which is
being dismantled with Pentagon aid. ``And we will never do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian workers began building the complex in 1982. Former
Soviet officials say it was a replacement for Sverdlosk (now
Yekaterinburg), the Russian military installation where, in 1979,
an accidental release of anthrax microbes killed about 70 people as
well as livestock up to 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Its role in the confrontation between the superpowers remains
unclear. Kanatjan Alibekov, or Ken Alibek, as he is now known,
Stepnogorsk's former director who defected to the United States in
1992, says the plant was to produce up to 330 tons of final
``product'' in a 200-day period if the order came to mobilize for
war.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, however, Moscow says Stepnogorsk made only vaccines
and other defensive germ products. But Russian scientists who
worked there in Soviet days and now run the place say otherwise.
``This plant was an integral part of the Soviet germ weapons
program,'' said Lepyoshkin, the former Soviet colonel who now heads
Kazakhstan's National Center on Biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the remaining physical evidence of its real purpose is
impossible to hide. Next to a concrete bunker is a machine that
Alibek said was for filling and sealing bomblets. Such equipment _
which a Pentagon official called ``a smoking gun'' in that it
proves the factory produced weapons, not vaccines _ had never
previously been discovered at a Russian germ installation.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Washington has been trying to help Kazakhstan
convert the installation to peaceful work through a low-key, $5
million program. But the effort has moved slowly. Financial aid was
tied up until last spring when Kazakh officials finally stopped
demanding that Washington fork up $12 million for unpaid utility
bills and pay taxes on its assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial success will not be easy, experts say. Stepnogorsk is
extremely isolated and, as of last month, had food shortages and
little or no heat. The city's airport is mothballed, as are the
only hotel and movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, a well-equipped toxicology lab there opened after an
infusion of more than $750,000 in American aid. The lab employs
about 60 former germ scientists who have begun producing, among
other things, vials of burn ointment.
</P>
<P>
   Other former employees are struggling to make a living in the
impoverished town of 70,000. ``Hope dies last,'' said Sergei
Antonovitch, a former germ plant scientist who now owns a poorly
stocked pharmacy in town.
</P>
<P>
   While Kazakhstan has dismantled its germ program, doubts persist
about Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's lies on the issue during the Cold War, skeptics in
Washington argue, make trust and cooperation impossible. Supporters
of the Western programs say they do not blindly trust Russia, but
feel partnership is the best chance for verifying Moscow's claim to
have renounced germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics note that Yeltsin has banned Russian experts from
discussing any aspect of their country's germ history and has
retained several generals instrumental in the Soviet program.
</P>
<P>
   They worry, particularly, that research may be quietly
proceeding on some of the least known of the Soviet advances:
``bio-regulators.'' This work was aimed at creating germ agents
that could take control of human functions like moods, heart
rhythms and sleep patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Igor V. Domaradskij, a pioneer of the Soviet program, said in a
recent interview that his scientists were searching for compounds
that could ``sharply change a person's behavior or emotions, such
as causing fear or an ultra-rapid heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as is known, they did not succeed. But Domaradskij said
biological science had now progressed to the the point where ``it
can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Alibek, the former germ scientist who once ran the plant in
Kazakhstan, is critical of part of the West's approach. The Soviet
germ program was hidden in a myriad of civilian and military
institutes. Even Soviet intelligence, the KGB, he disclosed, had
its own germ centers, which developed agents for assassination
under the code name Flayta, or Flute.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Moscow's former germ scientists, he said, have recently
published papers that could conceivably aid weapons research,
including several about cultivating the deadly Marburg virus.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, Alibek insisted, will never entirely abandon a program
in which it had military superiority, no matter how many treaties
it signs or cooperative programs it joins. ``I say, `Guys, don't be
so gullible. They're lying to you,'' ' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Floyd D. Spence, R-S.C., who heads the House Committee on
National Security, contended that even civilian biology
partnerships might be dangerous if they helped sustain Russia's
germ establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say those exchange programs are already
showing results. Those who follow the program most closely say that
there is no evidence of large-scale activity even at the military
institutes. And one American expert, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said Russia's economic turmoil made large-scale germ
work unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there is a well-lit, well-heated, well-funded military
lab out there that is just humming along, totally insulated from
the cutbacks that have slashed funding for military salaries and
other critical Russian defense needs,'' he said. ``But I don't
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Top Russian scientists deny that Russia still has a germ weapons
program. ``Everything has been destroyed, on our side and yours,''
said Nickolai N. Urakov, a former Soviet general who heads a
converted germ center at Obolensk that now does research for
peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who helped sponsor legislation
authorizing the scientific exchanges and recently toured Obolensk,
said the ambiguity about Russia's germ program would persist
because much basic biological research has both civilian and
military applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something you see with a satellite,'' he said.
``It all turns on intent. That's why this is such a hard
intelligence problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But the gamble, he said, is worth the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't know, and won't know for many years to come,
whether or not we succeeded,'' Nunn said recently in Moscow. ``But
we do know that while we can argue about whether the glass is half
full or half empty, we know that the trend is right. A decade ago,
the glass was all empty.''

EDITORIAL: SOUND ADVICE FROM THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 28:
</P>
<P>
   Though the Senate has had little more than a week to ponder the
articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton, it has already done
much to restore a sense of proportion and reason to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan sentiment seems rapidly to be gathering around the
idea of strongly censuring Clinton rather than removing him from
office, and doing so with dispatch when the new Congress convenes
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching that outcome will require the cooperation of the White
House and strong leadership in the Senate to prevent the
impeachment case from being kidnapped by conservative Republican
senators who would like to drive Clinton from the White House
against the public will.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a student of the Constitution, has
provided that kind of leadership with an astute analysis of the
case. He rightly reasons that Clinton's misconduct, while deserving
condemnation and punishment, does not reach the level of high
crimes set by the framers for removal of a president by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan also argues wisely that the cavalier use of impeachment
would destabilize the institution of the presidency, an office
vital not only to American governance but to world welfare as well.
Coming from a man who has not hesitated to part company with
Clinton on numerous occasions and is not seeking re-election, this
advice ought to carry great weight with the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Managing the unusual set of legal and political issues facing
the Senate will not be easy. Though Sen. Robert Byrd has advised
colleagues that the Constitution does not require them to conduct a
full trial of the charges against Clinton, most senators favor
opening a trial. That now seems likely to happen in January, with
other Senate business set aside until the case is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   A motion to suspend or end the trial can be made at any time and
approved by a simple majority vote. Conviction and removal from
office takes 67 votes. Finding the right moment to adjourn the
trial will be a delicate and critical decision for those who favor
censuring Clinton, and will require at least six Republican votes
if the Senate's 45 Democrats are united.
</P>
<P>
   At some point Clinton must decide whether he wants to press for
a full trial, anticipating acquittal but risking the possibility
that the case would veer out of control, as it did in the House.
</P>
<P>
   As of now there are not enough votes to convict, but nothing
about the Lewinsky case has followed a familiar script. Tom
Daschle, the minority leader, seems to appreciate that danger and
is urging the White House not to break the momentum toward censure
by trying to impede Senate consideration of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The White House can contest the proceedings at every turn, and
certainly has a legal right to do so. Clinton's aides can seek a
month's delay once a trial begins, so that the White House can
prepare a defense. Once the presentation of evidence commences,
Clinton will be well within his rights to contest the facts and
legal theories offered by the prosecution team composed of House
members.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's political interests and the country's need to
resolve this crisis would be ill served by a legal strategy of
delay and resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said as much on Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' when
he noted that many of the facts in the Lewinsky case are well
established and the White House ought not to try to block the start
of a Senate trial. It is good advice, and for a change, Clinton
should take it instead of listening to the lawyers who helped get
him impeached.

NEW YEAR'S EVE WILL BE NO HOLIDAY FOR THE JETS
</HEADLINE>
  (With FBN-JETS-PATRIOTS) 
(ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Jets have three days off with the bye week. But
Coach Bill Parcells is bringing them back on Thursday, New Year's
Eve, for the start of three days of workouts. Next week they will
have four days to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Their divisional playoff game at Giants Stadium in East
Rutherford, N.J., on Jan. 10 will start at 12:30 p.m.. If the
Jacksonville Jaguars defeat the New England Patriots, the wild-card
opponent, on Sunday, the Jets would play Jacksonville. If not, then
the Jets will play host to the winner of the Miami Dolphins-Buffalo
Bills game, which will be played in Miami on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jets are hosts for the American Football Conference
championship game, the National Football League's headquarters
hotel will be the Waldorf-Astoria. That is in sharp contrast to the
franchise's first headquarters, back in 1960, when they were the
Titans: the Park Avenue apartment of their owner, Harry Wismer.
A Streak Ends &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the Jets' opening play Sunday against the Patriots, a kickoff
return, the club's stretch of penalty-free special-teams play
suddenly ended. Chad Cascadden was flagged for holding. That halted
a five-game stretch for the special teams in which opponents
committed 15 penalties to none for the Jets.  &QL; 
Numbers of Note &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some notable numbers from the regular season:
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson caught 10 touchdowns, the most for a Jet since
1986, when Wesley Walker snared 12.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's 83 catches were fourth-highest for a single season in
club history.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' total of 416 points was 3 under the club record set in
1968.  &QL; 
Shifting the Defense &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Corwin Brown, a special-teamer who comes in on dime defenses,
made a rare start at free safety in place of Jerome Henderson. ``We
wanted someone to tackle Edwards in case he got loose,'' said
Parcells, ``and Corwin's a good tackler.'' Robert Edwards, the
Pats' 1,000-yard rookie rusher, was held to 47 yards on 12 carries,
and that included an 18-yard run. Actually, Pepper Johnson wound up
as the club's leading tackler, including assists. He had a total of
six, even though he alternates quarters with Dwayne Gordon.
Defensive end Anthony Pleasant got the game's only sack, one of his
five tackles.

EDITORIAL: GOOD-TIMES BUDGETING IN NEW YORK  
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 28:
</P>
<P>
   The boom on Wall Street and rippling prosperity in the region
have again brought a bounty of budget surpluses to New York City
and New York state. The good times guarantee, in turn, that the new
year will begin with temptations at City Hall and the state Capitol
to spend the money on expanded programs and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki put the
final touches on budgets due in January, they need to remember that
deficits and mounting debts remain a long-term threat to the fiscal
health of the city and state. The surpluses of today should be
husbanded as a cushion against the day when the economy turns down.
</P>
<P>
   As state Comptroller Carl McCall reported earlier this month,
New York City is likely to end the current fiscal year with a $1
billion surplus, which is certainly positive news. But he also
noted that spending is growing at a rapid rate, largely because of
salary increases for city workers negotiated four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the city is projecting a budget deficit of nearly
$3 billion in two years, while debt service is scheduled to consume
19 percent of the budget by the year 2002. City Hall regards
McCall's projection as overly pessimistic. Even so, Giuliani has
sensibly asked city agencies for possible budget cuts for the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The city's sobering budget outlook would get worse if the Wall
Street boom faded, which many experts fear is likely. In addition,
the last contract of District Council 37, the largest municipal
union, was unpopular with its members but approved in what turned
out to be a rigged election. Employees are certain to demand bigger
wage and benefit hikes in the next round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani may be running for higher office by then, but he needs
to begin making plans to ensure that new wage increases are
financed by changes in work rules to lower costs and improve
productivity. He should also take some of the current surplus and
use it for capital projects like school construction, or to pay
down existing debt to lower debt-service costs in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal terms, the state is in more precarious shape than New
York City, largely because of the Albany addiction to enacting tax
cuts and spending programs that grow each year. Though the state is
also ending the current year with a surplus, estimated at $1.5
billion, it faces a deficit next year of $2.5 billion and more than
$5 billion the year after.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Joseph Bruno, majority leader of the
Republican-controlled state Senate, announced that despite the
projected deficit, he would push for a new program of
college-tuition tax breaks that, when fully implemented, would
drain $800 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic-controlled Assembly is expected to push for tax
cuts to encourage job growth upstate, and for more spending on
schools and early-childhood programs. Both sides have hinted that
they will seek money from the settlement with tobacco companies to
pay for their programs.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has not said what his own priorities will be. But as his
own office noted last week, it will be hard enough to preserve
previously enacted tax cuts and spending hikes without adding
costly new initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The most prudent approach for the state would be similar to that
for the city: using the bonanza of surpluses to lower debts and
invest in the state's infrastructure, avoiding a lurch from deficit
to deficit and a scramble to make ends meet when the good times
stop rolling.

LOS ANGELES: relief now from the anthrax fad.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I hope this hoax thing runs its course and dies down in a
couple of weeks,'' said Phil Klein, vice president of operations
for Time Warner Cable. ``If it's a hoax, I think we're as big a
target as any other high-profile business.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the company's disaster plan, all its calls were answered
at another facility during the crisis, and repair appointments went
uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been concerned about something like this, and we
were prepared for it,'' Klein said while standing quarantined with
other employees Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation is the key to weathering such a threat, said Mark
Leaf, spokesman for Pinkerton, the world's oldest security services
company.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's not aware of increased anxiety among Pinkerton
clients since the anthrax scares, but he did say that companies
should have emergency plans for any crisis, exotic or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the anthrax scare had somehow manifested true, it would
probably result in a quarantine for somebody's building,'' Leaf
said. So that company would need a contingency plan -- just like
after a building fire, for example -- so the business could
continue to operate.
</P>
<P>
   The hoaxes have also disrupted the jobs of emergency officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we'd like to go out and do our real work --
prevention, real disease surveillance,'' said Mascola of the Health
Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   So despite what the FBI, Police Department, Fire Department,
Health Department and other agencies have learned while chasing the
phantom reports, officials want to punish the hoax callers. Simply
phoning in an anthrax threat to a government building can net a
sentence of up to life in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of time. It causes a lot of panic in the
public,'' Mascola said. ``This is not a funny thing. If we catch
these people, they are going to jail.''

ANTHRAX HOAXES COST PUBLIC TIME, MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The recent anthrax contamination scares in Los
Angeles taught emergency officials two important lessons: The
deadly bacteria simply are not that easy to spread or catch, and
officials are well-prepared regardless.
</P>
<P>
   Because every threat so far has been a hoax and the chances of
widespread contamination are so remote, safety officials say they
plan to scale back their responses to similar incidents in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't want to play into the hands of someone creating
a hoax and creating a fear level that isn't necessary,'' said Los
Angeles police spokesman Lt. Anthony Alba.
</P>
<P>
   If anything good has come from these threats in the suburban San
Fernando Valley northwest of downtown Los Angeles and elsewhere, it
is that they are forcing companies to develop disaster response
plans and giving police and public health officials a chance to
test their training and ability to work in concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time we meet, it's easier, it's more fluid,'' Alba said.
But ``God help us if we have a real disaster while we're involved
in one of these phony calls.''
</P>
<P>
   A threat of biological terrorism, an evacuation and a search by
hazardous-materials teams -- this scene played out Dec. 17 at a
Westwood office building, the next day at U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Woodland Hills, approximately 25 miles northwest of downtown Los
Angeles, then Dec. 21 at the Municipal and Superior courthouses in
Van Nuys several miles to the east and again over the weekend at a
nightclub in Pomona, about 31 miles east of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A more vague threat of chemical contamination was called in
Wednesday at the suburban Chatsworth office of Time Warner Cable in
the San Fernando Valley and found to be false.
</P>
<P>
   The region's threats of anthrax contamination reflect what the
FBI says is a trend across the nation. And every time, tests showed
no sign of the anthrax bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually very, very hard to transmit,'' said Dr. Laurene
Mascola, chief of the acute communicable disease control unit with
the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. ``It would
have to be very, very sophisticated for someone to spread
anthrax.''
</P>
<P>
   Call these threats dress rehearsals with real-life urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned a tremendous amount from this,'' said Los
Angeles Police Department Cmdr. Bruce E. Hagerty. That education
has helped the agencies revise how they respond to the anthrax
calls.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the threat Wednesday that forced 200 workers to
evacuate Time Warner Cable was quickly deemed to be a hoax. There
was no evidence of contamination at the scene, the telephone threat
was vague, and the caller gave no hint he had the expertise to pull
off a biological attack, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not very impressed with local cases,'' Mascola
said. ``You just can't sort of throw anthrax in somewhere and say
goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone would need an extensive background in chemistry and
access to a laboratory to ``aerosolize'' anthrax spores, making the
bacteria airborne -- their deadliest form.
</P>
<P>
   But because the bacteria can cause infection throughout the body
and death if untreated, police, fire and health officials responded
to every threat as if it were the real thing. And every false alarm
costs Los Angeles about $500,000 in equipment and personnel costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nuisance, but compared to what it could be . . . it's
more of a nuisance to the folks standing around for five hours,''
Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Bob Collis said.
</P>
<P>
   Now more confident that they can handle a real emergency, police
and firefighters say they will remain diligent in their response
but say they plan to cut back resources unless obviously needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first responders are going to look at the possibility of a
smaller initial response,'' Alba said. ``We're trying not to
displace people. We're trying not to create anxiety where it
doesn't need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   With each threat since the Westwood scare, officials have eased
the level of reaction: As a result of the Woodland Hills threat,
those thought to be contaminated were given prescriptions for
antibiotics, but in subsequent scares they were not.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of immediately decontaminating people, they send
evacuees home with a note telling them to scrub in a hot shower and
place their clothes in a plastic bag. And they instruct the people
to wait for results of anthrax tests -- tests that have been
negative in every case so far.
</P>
<P>
   If anthrax had been found, however, there would have been enough
time to administer antibiotics to the victims and stave off the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public can be reassured that a lot of these issues are
nonissues,'' Mascola said. ``We've got anthrax down.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax was the first disease for which a vaccine was developed,
back in 1881 by Louis Pasteur.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria is most commonly found in the soil and spreads to
cattle, sheep and other animals through their food and insect
bites. Vaccination has all but wiped out the disease in the Western
world.
</P>
<P>
   But with a 90 percent fatality rate if left untreated, anthrax
has terrified people for ages.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein has claimed he has enough of the bacteria to wipe
out millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word anthrax is just such a buzzword, and biological and
chemical warfare is such an unknown quantity -- that seems to be
the power behind these threats,'' FBI spokeswoman Debbie Weierman
said. ``It plays on people's hysteria. That alone is paralyzing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the flavor of the month. Twenty years ago,
people didn't call in threats for anthrax. Heck, 10 years from now,
five years from now, something else will come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Others want relief now from the anthrax fad.
</P>

UCLA'S KOCHER SKIPS TO HEAD OF THE CLASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When UCLA's heralded freshman class gathered for
training camp in August, the unspoken consensus was that tailback
DeShaun Foster would become the first rookie to start. He had
superb talent and played a position without a returning starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the obvious choice, because you'd heard so much about
him,'' freshman nose guard Ken Kocher said. ``I certainly thought
it would be DeShaun.''
</P>
<P>
   Kocher didn't give himself much chance _ if not Foster, he
figured, then perhaps linebacker Robert Thomas or guard Mike Saffer
_ but he should have.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Micah Webb's career-threatening knee injury, Kocher
has beaten his classmates to that elusive first start and will join
the lineup against Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome,'' he said. ``It's too bad Micah got hurt, but it
put me in this position and I'm really excited. I can't wait. I'll
be pumped up like crazy, but I've got to think about it like any
other game and try not to let it get to me. I'll have to settle
down and concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   An All-American last year at San Diego's Patrick Henry High,
Kocher was as well-regarded nationally as Foster, Thomas and
Saffer. He's big (6-foot-4, 295 pounds) and strong and moves well
for his size. He has split time with Webb since the second game and
is considered UCLA's run-stopper of the future.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Kocher must help UCLA slow Wisconsin tailback
Ron Dayne, who rushed for 1,279 yards this season. That means
improving his separation skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to learn to separate from the offensive line and run
to the ball,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``He has a tendency to
stay locked up (with linemen).''
</P>
<P>
   My brother the Badger: Reserve tight end Bryan Fletcher rooted
for Wisconsin over UCLA in the 1994 Rose Bowl, and for a very good
reason: his brother, Terrell, was a tailback for the Badgers and
rushed for 64 yards in Wisconsin's 21-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher did not attend the game for financial reasons but
watched it with siblings in his living room in St. Louis. He was a
freshman at Hazelwood East High School at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a gung-ho Badgers fan, and to me, UCLA was the bad
guy,'' he said. ``I never thought about coming to school here until
my senior year, when I got a (recruiting) letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been to California to visit my brother (who plays for the
San Diego Chargers), and I liked the lifestyle and atmosphere. Then
I visited campus and decided this was the place for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, a redshirt freshman, has played sparingly this season
behind seniors Mike Grieb and Ryan Neufeld. But he's the best
athlete among UCLA's seven tight ends and is expected to compete
with Gabe Crecion and Randy Hakes for the starting job next season.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo practiced this
weekend and will play in the Rose Bowl, although the sprained
ligaments in his left knee have not healed completely.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Pete Holland probably will play despite sprained
ligaments in his elbow that may require postseason surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Durell Price broke a rib against Miami and missed
several workouts following the game. A Sylmar native, Price will
play but has been replaced in the starting lineup by Westlake
senior Craig Walendy.
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti update: Toledo confirmed Sunday what he indicated two
weeks earlier _ that Nick Aliotti will be retained as the defensive
coordinator if he agrees to play more zone defense. They'll meet
after the Rose Bowl to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some changes made,'' Toledo said. ``That's
something we have to talk about....
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't foresee any changes in the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo update: UCLA chancellor Albert Carnesale, who spoke to
the Bruins after Saturday's practice, supports a new contract for
Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is everybody wants it to happen, and
I'm confident it will,'' said Carnesale, who declined to give
details on length or dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Toledo will receive a six- or seven-year rollover
deal worth approximately $600,000 per year, making him one of the
highest-paid coaches in the Pacific-10. (He's currently ninth, at
$453,000 per season.) However, it may be several weeks before the
contract is finalized.

ARTS LEADER STILL GUIDING YOUTHS AND HOLIDAY PLAY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Elma Lewis, 77, tried not working, on orders from her
doctors. ``I went down to 98 pounds and almost died when they made
me not work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis, who suffers from kidney failure and undergoes
dialysis three times a week, now follows her own prescription:
``Work, work, work until you die.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after Christmas found her backstage at the Tremont
Temple theater downtown _ she had come straight from dialysis _
meeting with the large cast of ``Black Nativity,'' the exuberant
Langston Hughes gospel play she has been producing and directing
during the holiday season here for 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes has left her nearly blind, but Ms. Lewis makes it clear
that she is not about to let that fact get in the way of her
directing. ``I saw perfectly well for over 60 years, and I can
still see some things,'' she said during an interview earlier in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking at what's lost,'' she added. ``I have to
look at what I have and where I can go.''
</P>
<P>
   What this daughter of West Indian immigrants has are 28 honorary
doctorate degrees, the Presidential Medal for the Arts, a MacArthur
Fellowship, commonly called the genius grant, and, most important
to her, the several generations of children who have come under her
influence through ``Black Nativity,'' and at the Elma Lewis School
of Fine Arts which she opened in 1950 and which she hopes will soon
reopen. In them she has instilled her creed: ``Glory in yourself.
Anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how her parents, Clairmont and Edwardine Lewis, a day
laborer and a maid, who revered education, the arts and Marcus
Garvey, raised her and her two older brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up you mighty people, you can what you will,'' Ms. Lewis said,
quoting Marcus Garvey, whose teachings still guide her.
</P>
<P>
   She was talking in the living room of the two-story house, in
the Roxbury neighborhood, that once belonged to her parents. She
was seated across from the grand piano, covered with Christmas
cards, that her mother had bought for her brother Darnley when he
was a boy with precocious musical talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to my mother that she would go and buy a
secondhand, run-down piano,'' Ms. Lewis said. ``She went and bought
this piano for $1,200 _ a dollar a week.'' Practicing on that
piano, Ms. Lewis' late brother went on to the New England
Conservatory of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis also showed early talent in the arts, and at age 3 her
mother had her evaluated by a team of white educators. Ms. Lewis
can still quote from the report: ``This bright, precocious little
Negro girl will, as is usual with members of her race, test at a
much lower level as she gets older.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had already written me off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But her parents would not allow their daughter to be written
off, and she went on to the prestigious Boston Latin School. She
worked her way through Emerson College, and Boston University,
where she earned a master's degree in education, by dancing and
reciting poetry in churches.
</P>
<P>
   She opened her school in Roxbury with $300, two used pianos, two
used folding tables and two used chairs. It never occurred to her
that the school might not succeed. ``If I wanted to do something, I
did it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The world came to Boston to help Ms. Lewis. Harry Belafonte,
Duke Ellington, Odetta, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Max Roach: They all
pitched in to teach or perform or help raise money. Over the years,
thousands of children studied classical ballet _ taught by Ms.
Lewis herself _ theater and voice at the Elma Lewis School.
</P>
<P>
   One of those children was Annette Brown, who went on to become a
choreographer, and the ballet mistress for ``Black Nativity.'' ``My
whole life was dancing with Miss Lewis,'' said Ms. Brown, 51. ``She
always told us we were working to be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown was talking before the evening performance of ``Black
Nativity'' last Saturday, the second-to-last day of this year's
run. The show, with its cast of 150 professionals and amateurs,
nearly half of them children, is produced by the nonprofit National
Center of Afro-American Artists, which Ms. Lewis founded. The story
of the birth of Christ set to the beat of African drums, ``Black
Nativity'' is as much a part of the holiday scene in Boston as the
Nutcracker Ballet that is performed at the Wang and Emerson
Theatres down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Families have grown up with ``Black Nativity,'' the children
starting out in the role of the baby Jesus, moving on to the chorus
and eventually, if they are talented and disciplined, becoming
soloists. Sele'Fana Kamau, 20, joined the chorus when she was 6,
and never left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be afraid to sing,'' said Ms. Kamau, who credits her
four-year scholarship to the Berklee School of Music to her
training with Ms. Lewis. ``My heart would go boom, boom, boom.''
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly showtime. John Andrew Ross, the musical director,
took his place at the piano, as he has for 29 years. Ms. Lewis,
wearing a long red dress and bent over her walker, took a seat in
one of the first rows of the audience. It was her second
performance of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The audience clapped and sang and shouted along with ``Black
Nativity,'' and when it was over they gave it a standing ovation as
they do almost every night. Ms. Lewis still had the
post-performance critique to do with the cast. Despite her near
blindness, she seems to see every step and misstep on stage. ``The
children ask me, `How do you know I'm wrong?','' she said. ``I tell
them, `Never mind how I know. I know. That's my gift.' ''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More money than ever is pouring into New York's local
and state election campaigns, but the system of regulating these
funds to curb their influence on politics and policy has all but
broken down.
</P>
<P>
   Porous laws, feeble enforcement and a political class
increasingly adept at sidestepping the rules have left the system
with few constraints, even by comparison to those of other states
and the federal government, according to a review of campaign
documents and interviews with elected officials and others.
</P>
<P>
   New York has rejected many of the laws adopted elsewhere, from
bans on donations by corporations and labor unions to publicly
financed campaigns. And while these changes have not always been
effective, New York's weakness stands out.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of this year's contests, the most expensive in state
history, shows a virtual free-for-all of donating and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Financier Ronald Perelman channeled more than $200,000 on two
days last August to Gov. George Pataki's campaign, using a common
loophole to give more than seven times the legal limit for an
individual donor. A Long Island company, Silverite Construction,
gave at least $20,000 over the legal limit, just as it was awarded
a $97 million state contract. The company was not punished.
</P>
<P>
   There are even fewer controls on how politicians spend
donations. Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Brooklyn Democrat, used
$100,000 of campaign contributions to pay lawyers who defended him
in a criminal bribery case. Assemblyman Anthony Seminerio, a Queens
Democrat, had his campaign buy a $25,OOO Ford Crown Victoria for
his full-time use. The campaign of State Sen. Guy Velella, a Bronx
Republican, bought an alarm system for his home. And State Sen.
Serphin Maltese, a Queens Republican, took a two-week trip to
Italy, paid for with campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York state campaign finance laws are atrocious,'' said
John Feerick, dean of the Fordham Law School, who led a state
commission in the 1980s that recommended more stringent campaign
finance laws, only to be rebuffed by the legislature. ``And if
anything, it seems pretty clear to me that things have gotten
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Pataki has declared the campaign finance laws ``dreadful.''
He made his pronouncement during his re-election campaign, in which
he set a record by spending nearly $20 million, much of it
collected from donors with business before the state.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are New York's laws weaker than many other states have,
but so is its enforcement. In California, New Jersey and many other
states, special agencies police campaign financs, but New York
gives the job to the politically paralyzed State Board of
Elections, whose focus is overseeing registration and balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The board collected roughly $20,000 in fines in 1997 for
campaign violations. Its counterpart in California collected more
than $650,000 in fines that year.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, politicians sometimes seem to mock
public-disclosure rules. Pataki used to file his contributors
listed alphabetically by first name, making analysis difficult.
This fall, his campaign submitted a list of nearly $4 million in
expenditures in type so small that much of it was, for all
practical purposes, unreadable. The state plans to put the records
in a computer next year, long after the practice in other states.
</P>
<P>
   New York's race for governor this year cost $40 million, up from
$32 million in 1994. Legislative campaign committees raised more
than $8 million, roughly double the total in 1994. Overall,
candidates and political committees in New York have spent more
than $200 million on state and local campaigns over the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, Perelman, who controls Revlon, easily skirted
the limits on donations.
</P>
<P>
   By law, a corporation's donations to all state and local
candidates and political committees can generally not exceed a
total of $5,000 annually. And a gubernatorial campaign can accept
no more than $28,000 from an individual contributor in a general
election.
</P>
<P>
   So how can one person give more than $200,000? In Perelman's
case, he divided it among more than 40 corporations that he
controls, each of which gave $5,000. In doing so, he also got
around a rule that limits individuals to an aggregate maximum of
$150,000 a year in donations.
</P>
<P>
   The state has never deemed this practice illegal even though
other jurisdictions prohibit it.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the only way around corporate limits: Just like on
the federal level, corporations can donate unlimited amounts of
so-called soft money, which political parties can legally use only
for ``party building'' activities, like get-out-the-vote drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Elections, though, does not monitor how the state
parties handle soft money. In fact, the Republican State Committee
has raised $7.5 million in soft money since 1995 and transferred
most of it to a federal political account in Washington, putting it
outside the jurisdiction of the state board.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of states put no limits on contributions. But most
of those, including Texas, bar all contributions from corporations
and unions.
</P>
<P>
   New York is even more lenient with unions than it is with
corporations. Unions are held to the same contribution limits as
individual donors, allowing them to become major players in Albany.
Since 1995, for example, the state teachers union has donated $1.25
million to the committees run by the legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a growing number of states, New York allows fund-raising
by legislators while they are in session. It is common in Albany
for lobbyists to attend fund-raisers at night where they contribute
to the same legislators they buttonhole about bills during the day.
More than 200 such events were held in the state capital this year.
</P>
<P>
   The state law governing the spending of campaign donations is
terse yet expansive. ``Contributions received by a candidate or a
political committee may be expended for any lawful purpose,'' it
says. ``Such funds shall not be converted by any person to a
personal use which is unrelated to a political campaign or the
holding of a public office or party position.''
</P>
<P>
   With those guidelines, politicians can justify virtually any
expenditure. Most campaign money is spent on expenses such as
advertising and staff.
</P>
<P>
   Many legislators lease cars year-round _ including in
non-election years _ then charge the cost to their campaigns and
drive the vehicles on personal as well as political or governmental
matters. Seminerio went further and spent $25,000 in campaign money
last year on the Ford Crown Victoria. ``As an Assembly person, I'm
on like 24 hours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Hikind was indicted last year on charges of receiving
bribes from a social-services group, he hired a prominent defense
lawyer, Gustave Newman, and paid him with $100,000 in campaign
funds. Hikind, who was acquitted on all the charges, did not
respond to three telephone messages seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The State Board of Elections did not question these expenditures
or seek more information on them.

COMMENTARY: FOR A `CITIZEN'S PRIVILEGE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What can we do to transform the messiness of 1998
into the improvement of our national life in the new year? How can
we make lemonade out of this lemon of a presidency?
</P>
<P>
   Step One is well under way: After House impeachment and Senate
action, no high official will be tempted to lie under oath or
obstruct justice again soon.
</P>
<P>
   Step Two has yet to be addressed: At the root of Bill Clinton's
undoubted criminality is a bad law.
</P>
<P>
   Needed is change in civil rights and sexual harassment
litigation to enable the accused to assert a new ``citizen's
privilege'' _ to refuse to involve third parties in an accuser's
attempt to prove a pattern of harassment. If forced to confess as a
condition of continuance, Clinton can claim to be a martyr to his
civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   Step Three is to practice a long-overdue social jujitsu. We must
use the force of the public's revulsion at the excesses being
committed by the exposers of adultery to stop the erosion of
personal privacy in public life.
</P>
<P>
   For daring to expose the real crimes committed to cover up moral
transgressions, political figures are being ``outed'' for their
adultery _ as if marital infidelity were equivalent to the crime of
perjury. It is not. Sin is private and crime is public. To pretend
otherwise for political or commercial gain is the height of
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   As an avowed libertarian conservative, I come to this assertion
with nonpartisan hands. My privacy epiphany came after being
wiretapped in the Nixon era. In this space, I deplored the use of
divorce testimony to savage John Tower; defended Democratic Sen.
Gary Hart and Mayor Marion Barry from lip-smacking sex entrappers;
assailed the attempted radical-feminist lynching of Clarence
Thomas; and denounced the Senate's unprecedented rummaging through
Bob Packwood's personal diaries at the insistence of a
sanctimonious Nevada ``ethicist.''
</P>
<P>
   We privateers now face a danger from a combination of
sin-seekers on the right and hypocrisy hypocrites on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Today, adulterers are the targets of choice. Tomorrow, the
hypocri-moralizers will demand answers from female candidates about
ever having had an abortion; from youthful candidates about
masturbation; from the unmarried about ever having had homosexual
thoughts; and from the purest of the pure about how they can
condone their own children's premarital sex. Do we really want to
pit truthful eunuchs against normal liars?
</P>
<P>
   One way to help slow this trend is for journalists who do their
job of exposing financial and political corruption to look with
disdain on those pornalists who march lockstep with the morality
cops. And for family media to refuse to recycle uncritically the
linen of sex-hungry media.
</P>
<P>
   We need the aid of public figures in this. In the 1980s, a
reporter from a responsible newspaper asked Gary Hart the naked
question ``Have you ever committed adultery?'' The candidate, with
a stricken look on his face, said that he thought nobody should be
required to answer such a question. In 1992, Clinton found a
creative way to slip past the question.
</P>
<P>
   But Hart was right; the ``A'' question, unless dealing with a
crime, ought never to be asked. But since it will be, what should
the answer be?
</P>
<P>
   The response I suggested then has merit today: an aggressive,
offended ``Go to hell!'' (Because the word ``hell,'' unless used to
mean the domain of the devil, is stylistically frowned upon at The
New York Times and other family-friendly publications, I will amend
that to a vigorous ``Leap in the lake!'' or a genteel ``Mind your
own business.'')
</P>
<P>
   The rationale is this: When an absolutely faithful spouse boasts
``I have never strayed,'' he or she puts pressure on all other
candidates to violate their families' privacy or to lie. Such
bragging rewards sexual snoopiness, and encourages the pornalists'
descent into questions shudderingly described above.
</P>
<P>
   When Dan Quayle volunteered assurance of his never-wavering
fidelity on national television recently, he thereby unthinkingly
undermined the civil liberty of fellow candidates. Dan _ a good man
_ ought to be ashamed of himself, as should any other non-sinner
who slyly encourages such intrusive questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Professions of purity pollute our politics. Don't brag; don't
lie; just assert your ``citizen's privilege'' and don't make news
with an answer.

HONORIA DONNELLY, 81, DAUGHTER OF AVANT-GARDE COUPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., Va.)  (lb) 
 By MARGALIT FOX   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Honoria Murphy Donnelly, the daughter of Gerald and Sara Murphy,
the golden couple at the center of the modernist whirl in 1920s
Europe, who was dandled on the knees of the towering figures of the
avant-garde, died on Tuesday at the Hospice of Palm Beach in Palm
Beach, Fla. She was 81 and lived in Palm Beach Shores and East
Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, said Amanda Vaill, the author of
``Everybody Was So Young: Gerald and Sara Murphy _ A Lost
Generation Love Story'' (Houghton Mifflin).
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Donnelly, the eldest of the Murphys' three children and the
only one to reach adulthood, published a biography of her parents,
``Sara &AMP; Gerald: Villa America and After'' (Times Books) written
with Richard N. Billings, in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Attractive, cultured and well-to-do (Gerald was heir to the Mark
Cross leather-goods fortune, Sara the daughter of an industrialist
and a grandniece of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman), the Murphys
epitomized the urbane insouciance of the jazz age.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gerald enjoyed a brief career as a painter _ his small
output remains well regarded _ he and his wife were content to
occupy backstage roles as bartenders, muses and sometime financial
angels to the foremost writers, composers and artists of their age.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Murphys were memorialized (not always graciously)
in the work they supported. They were the inspiration for Dick and
Nicole Diver in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel ``Tender is the
Night''; Sara was the model for Picasso's ``Woman in White,'' and
Fitzgerald bestowed the name Honoria on the heroine of his 1931
story ``Babylon Revisited.''
</P>
<P>
   Honoria Adeline Murphy (she pronounced the `H' in her first
name) was born in New York on Dec. 19, 1917. Fair-haired and
blue-eyed, she ``looked like a Renoir and was dressed
accordingly,'' in the words of the Murphy biographer Calvin
Tomkins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1921, partly to escape the philistinism of American culture,
the Murphys sailed for Europe with Honoria and her younger
brothers, Baoth and Patrick. In Paris they painted scenery for
Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, which gave them entree to a circle that
included Picasso and Jean Cocteau.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1925 the family moved to Antibes, on the
Riviera, then an unheard-of destination in warm weather. (The
Murphys are credited with starting the Riviera's summer season.)
They christened their house Villa America.
</P>
<P>
   At Villa America, they moved in a shimmering bubble that seemed
to insulate them from ordinary cares. The late '20s passed there in
a charmed blur of jazz and champagne and beaded dresses, of spats
and white flannels and sherry and biscuits on the seashore. A
representative guest list: Picasso, Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos,
Archibald MacLeish, Philip Barry, Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker,
Cole Porter, Monty Woolley, Igor Stravinsky, Fernand Leger, and
Ernest Hemingway and his consecutive wives.
</P>
<P>
   To Honoria and her brothers, these artistic titans were simply
the adored tall people of their enchanted childhood. Hemingway
taught her to catch and gut fish. (She got off easy: He once tried
to teach her father to fight bulls.) The photographs in the family
album were by Man Ray. Scrutinizing one of Honoria's drawings hung
on the Villa America terrace (nicknamed ``Les Salons de
Jeunesse''), Picasso counseled, ``Don't change it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young woman, she studied French theater history with Mrs.
Darius Milhaud and acting with Mrs. Patrick Campbell. She later
performed with the French Theater of New York and worked as a
secretary for Theater Inc., a producing organization. In recent
years, she lectured on the Lost Generation writers and opened her
vast archive of family memorabilia to scholars of the period.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929 the real world intruded savagely on the Murphys' idyll
when their youngest son, Patrick, was found to have tuberculosis.
They returned to the United States, where Honoria attended Rosemary
Hall School in Greenwich, Conn., and the Spence School in New York,
from which she graduated in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   It was Baoth who died first, in 1935, after contracting spinal
meningitis at 15. ``Only the invented part of our life _ the unreal
part _ has had any scheme, any beauty,'' Gerald Murphy wrote to
Fitzgerald. ``Life itself has stepped in now and blundered, scarred
and destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later Patrick died at 16. Fitzgerald wrote to the
Murphys: ``For a long, long time you will be inconsolable. But I
can see another generation growing up around Honoria and an
eventual peace somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   A devoted daughter who was ever conscious of her responsibility
as the sole surviving child, Honoria fulfilled that prophecy. After
an early marriage that ended in divorce, she married William M.
Donnelly, a businessman, in 1950. (On their honeymoon, she
telephoned her parents every night.)
</P>
<P>
   The couple lived in Carmel, Calif., and later in McLean, Va.
Mrs. Donnelly, who was widowed in 1988, is survived by their
children, John of Palm Beach Shores, Sherman of Key Biscayne, Fla.,
and Laura, of East Hampton, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``How different a dawn than the one we saw in a hospital 18
years ago,'' Gerald Murphy wrote to Sara after the Donnellys'
second son was born. ``Two boys went out from our family, and now
two other boys have come into it.''

HOFSTRA JOINS KENTUCKY AND ALCINDOR ON THE PLAQUES 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Norman Richardson, Hofstra's silky forward, did not
take long in explaining why he chose a relatively obscure college
over more prestigious options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were a rising program,'' he said. ``I'm happy I
came.''
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra Coach Jay Wright, sitting next to Richardson at a
post-game news conference, then responded, ``Me too, Stormy,'' and
planted a kiss on Richardson's head.
</P>
<P>
   Love was in the air at Madison Square Garden Sunday after
Hofstra's 67-62 victory over Pennsylvania in the championship game
of the ECAC Holiday Festival, though just minutes before the
atmosphere had been laced with tension.
</P>
<P>
   Penn (3-3) slashed Hofstra's 20-point lead to 2 on one occasion
and then to 3 in the final 96 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Wright read to his team the names of Kentucky
and Ohio State and other past tournament winners to illustrate the
significance of what his team could accomplish Sunday. Hofstra lost
to Georgia Tech and Manhattan in its only other ECAC tournament
appearance, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, the tournament's most valuable player who was
supported by 15 points from guard Jason Hernandez and 12 from
forward Roberto Gittens, was also told about previous most valuable
players such as Lew Alcindor and Chris Mullin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll go down in history,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the consolation game, Georgia Tech (9-3) outrebounded Iona by
53-38 and made eight more free throws than the Gaels for a 72-65
victory. Jason Floyd (11 points) hit a 3-pointer to put the Yellow
Jackets ahead for good with 4:22 remaining, igniting a 10-2 spurt.
Tech forward Jason Collier had 19 points. Center Alvin Jones had 10
points and 19 rebounds, and guard Tony Akins added 16 points.
``We're the best 4-7 team in America,'' Iona coach Jeff Ruland
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra repelled Penn's final comeback bid with the sticky
man-to-man defense that typified the Flying Dutchmen's play in
their impressive upset of Georgia Tech on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Quakers were trailing, 65-62, with 15.5 seconds to go and
were taking the ball out of bounds at their end of the court. After
Matt Langel and Michael Jordan, two of Penn's best 3-point
shooters, passed the ball back and forth, it came back to Jordan,
who found a sliver of room in the corner on the baseline with two
seconds to go. As Hernandez leaped with an arm extended, Jordan
flicked his jumper off the far side of the rim, and Richardson
grabbed the rebound. He made two free throws with two-tenths of a
second left to set off Hofstra's second subdued celebration in two
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost numb right now,'' Wright said. ``This is a great
day for our program.''
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra (7-4) had come close to returning to the anonymity from
which it came. Uncanny 3-point shooting (11 of 17) and a tolerable
11 turnovers enabled the Dutchmen to offset poor free-throw
shooting (15 of 23) down the stretch against the careful Quakers,
who had only seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson put the Dutchmen over the top. He hit 4 of 5 3-point
attempts in scoring 16 points and had 9 rebounds on the heels of a
23-point effort against Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra, which shot 50 percent for the game, tightened down the
stretch. Penn forward Jed Ryan scored 7 of his 14 points during a
frantic 14-0 surge to bring the Quakers to 62-60 with 1 minute 36
seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra's point guard, Craig Claxton (8 points, 7 assists), said
he distracted himself from the tightness by focusing on making a
play. The junior broke to his right, sending the defensive flow his
way, then rifled a cross-court pass to Hernandez. Hernandez buried
a 3-pointer to give Hofstra a 65-60 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan rattled in a layup to close the gap to 3 points with 43
seconds to go. After Gittens missed the front end of a one-and-one,
Jordan had a last shot at tying the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long way to come back, and we didn't give ourselves
enough time,'' Penn guard Matt Langel, who had 14 points, said.

MICHELLE THOMAS, 30, SOAP OPERA ACTRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Calif., Mass.)  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michelle Thomas, an actress in the television
programs ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Family Matters'' and ``The Young and
the Restless'' died on Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in Manhattan. She was 30 and lived in Los Angeles, though
she had been staying with her family in Weehawken, N.J., since
November.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Kahdijah Bell, her publicist and
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Thomas had been playing Callie, an aspiring vocalist, in
the CBS soap opera ``The Young and the Restless'' since August and
began a medical leave late in October.
</P>
<P>
   She was nominated recently for an Image Award from the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, as outstanding
actress in a daytime drama series, for her acting in that program.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier she played Justine, Theo's sweet, sensitive girlfriend,
on the NBC sitcom ``The Cosby Show.''
</P>
<P>
   She also played Myra, Steve Urkel's lovesick girlfriend, on
``Family Matters,'' also a sitcom, for five seasons, on ABC and
then on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Thomas also appeared on other television shows, onstage, in
commercials, on videos and in movies, including ``Hangin' With the
Homeboys'' (1991).
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Boston, grew up in Montclair, N.J., and
graduated from West Essex High School in North Caldwell, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   She received her basic training in acting from her mother,
Phynjuar Thomas, a stage actress who remained her personal coach
for the rest of her career.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Thomas also studied acting with Flo Greenberg and with Tony
Abeson.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her mother and her father, Dennis Thomas, a saxophonist
who is the musical director of the band Kool and the Gang, she is
survived by her grandfather, Cecil Saunders, and a brother, David,
all of Weehawken.

`PATCH ADAMS' FILLS WINNING PRESCRIPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The opening of Robin Williams' medical comedy
``Patch Adams'' generated healthy returns over the Christmas
holidays in the final weekend of a record-setting year for
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy brought in an estimated $25.5 million at 2,714
theaters during the Friday-Sunday period, continuing 1998's ongoing
strong performances from a wide variety of genres that have
generated close to $7 billion in domestic ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams,'' featuring Williams as a doctor using humor to
heal, represents the first hit for Universal Studios since ``The
Lost World: Jurassic Park'' opened in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly gives Universal a strong ending to a sour
year,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source
forecasting service, who predicted the film will eventually gross
$160 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Arthur Rockwell agreed that ``Patch Adams'' had
performed admirably, noting that six other films had taken in at
least $10 million over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a solid opening, particularly considering all the
competition,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum also pointed out that the ``Patch Adams'' victory
reflects moviegoers' strong appetite for comedies and noted that
``There's Something about Mary,'' ``Rush Hour'' and ``The
Waterboy'' have all posted results well above expectations during
the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's ``Stepmom,'' a drama with Julia Roberts and Susan
Sarandon, finished a strong second with $19.4 million at 2,358
theaters and will probably reach $100 million by the end of its
run.
</P>
<P>
   Studio spokesman Ed Russell said ``Stepmom'' beat internal
estimates and drew well from audience segments outside its core of
adult women.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of held-over films performed well in their second
weekends, with Warner Bros.' ``You've Got Mail'' finishing third
with $18.2 million at 2,759 screens, dropping just 1 percent from
last weekend, and DreamWorks SKG's ``The Prince of Egypt'' with
$15.4 million at 3,218 screens, representing a 5 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said both had rebounded well after their results were
held down during the opening weekend by the distractions of
President Clinton's impeachment and the bombing of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's opening of ``The Faculty'' finished fifth with a
respectable $11.3 million at 2,365 screens as the battle between
high school students and teachers possessed by evil forces drew
well from teen-age moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's family adventure ``Mighty Joe Young,'' an update on the
1949 original about a 15-foot gorilla, came in sixth with $10.5
million at 2,502 theaters. That edged out Disney's sixth weekend of
``A Bug's Life'' with $10 million at 2,456 screens, giving the
comedy $114 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many people expected `Mighty Joe Young' to perform
better, but there were a lot of films for families,'' Rockwell
said, ``It was still a very good weekend with no major disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said the coming week should see continued strong
business among family films, adding, ``as long as there's no more
bombing or impeachment hearings, it will be smooth sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's third weekend of ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' landed
in eighth place with $7.5 million at 2,677 theaters, followed by
Disney's sixth weekend of ``Enemy of the State'' with $5.2 million
at 1,505 screens and Warner's third weekend of ``Jack Frost'' with
$3.9 million at 2,142 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's drama ``Down in the Delta'' posted lukewarm returns in
its opening with $1.7 million at 4,116 theaters. A pair of
well-received dramas performed well in their qualifying runs for
Academy Award consideration -- 20th Century Fox's ``The Thin Red
Line'' with $275,000 at five theaters and Disney's ``A Civil
Action'' with $67,000 at two theaters.

CAVONNIER RETURNS IN WINNING STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ Cavonnier, a footnote in Kentucky Derby lore, earned a
whole chapter in horse racing's veterinary history Sunday when he
rallied to win at Santa Anita in his first race in 2{ years.
</P>
<P>
   The one-length victory in the $81,225 Ack Ack Stakes culminated
an on-again, off-again comeback for the gelding who was pulled up
with a right-front-tendon injury in the June 8, 1996 Belmont
Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional return to the Santa Anita winner's circle
for the team of jockey Chris McCarron, trainer Bob Baffert and
breeder-owners Robert and Barbara Walter, for whom Cavonnier won
the '96 Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reached over and felt Chris McCarron's heart and it was
pounding away,'' Barbara Walter said. ``And I was going to say to
him, `Here, feel mine,' but ... I don't think Mr. Walter would have
liked that.''
</P>
<P>
   After his upset win in the '96 Santa Anita Derby, Cavonnier lost
by a nose to the fast-finishing Grindstone in the closest Kentucky
Derby finish in 38 years, and he might have won if he hadn't been
struck across the face by another horse's whip.
</P>
<P>
   Cavonnier finished fourth in the Preakness before getting hurt
in the Belmont. The injury was expected to end his career.
</P>
<P>
   But the Walters, who live with their horses on a ranch near
Santa Rosa, spent money and patience on an experimental treatment
for Cavonnier's bowed tendon. A drug with the abbreviated name
BAPN-F, injected by UC Davis veterinarian Carol Gillis, allowed the
tendon to heal with its elasticity intact.
</P>
<P>
   BAPN-F has since been put on the market and then withdrawn _ at
least temporarily _ because the first commercial batch caused undue
swelling in some horses.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Cavonnier was next to last in the five-horse field
before going around and between the leaders to win ahead of Sidon
and favored Tibado. The 5-year-old ran a solid 1:35.79 mile and
paid $6.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron said he couldn't remember winning with a horse coming
off such a long layoff.
</P>
<P>
   Said a relieved Baffert: ``It's very emotional for me to see a
horse like that come back. Everybody was worried, `Will he hold
together? What if something happens out there?' But I never would
have entered him if I thought there was a slight chance he'd
reinjure himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Walter spoke optimistically of challenging top horses in
the races leading to the March 6 Santa Anita Handicap. Baffert was
more cautious: ``I'm just going to play it by ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on Day 2 of the Santa Anita season, Baffert-trained
Magical Allure survived a stewards' inquiry to win the $200,000 La
Brea Stakes for 3-year-old fillies.

   ``To get that many girls in the class, you have to recruit,''
said Tingey, who teaches computer science at Carlmont High School
in Belmont. ``I send them letters. I call them up. I tell them it's
a class about problem-solving, that a lot of kids do well in it and
that it gives them a big advantage in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Tingey is one of a small but growing number of Bay Area
educators who are actively working to involve girls in computer
programming _ trying to ensure that girls have an equal shot at the
technical jobs that are increasingly central to America's economy.
</P>
<P>
   These educators are facing a steep challenge. Nationally, only
17 percent of the students enrolled in advanced-placement (AP)
courses in computer science are girls.
</P>
<P>
   The California numbers are just slightly better: About one of
every four AP computer science students in this state is a girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls still tend to use computers for word processing rather
than for programming or for applications, which is where we believe
the careers of the future will be,'' said Maggie Ford, president of
the American Association of University Women Educational
Foundation, which issued a report this fall warning of a gender gap
in technology  &QL; 
education.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who have studied technology education say there are
several reasons for the paucity of girls in computer classes and
clubs:
</P>
<P>
   _Most computer and video games still have violent themes geared
toward boys. So girls don't grow up routinely playing electronic
games and don't feel as comfortable as boys do when it comes to
experimenting with computers.
</P>
<P>
   _Despite the rising number of female high-tech executives,
computer programming still carries a stereotype of being a male
``geek'' profession.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _Many schools teach computer programming as an end in itself,
divorced from other subjects. That's an approach that experts say
alienates many girls, who want to know how computers can be used in
their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The result? Situations like the one at at Saratoga High
School, which offers more than a half-dozen elective computer
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Girls are well represented in Saratoga High's introductory
computer classes that teach basic keyboarding _ the 1990s
equivalent of typing.
</P>
<P>
   But only about five of the 30 students in Saratoga's Web design/
HTML class are girls, according to technology coordinator Mel
Holliday. Only three or four of the 30 students in its class on
computer-assisted design are girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think, `Gosh, here are all these boys, where are the
girls?''' said Holliday. ``We don't really have an answer. We think
about trying to change this, but we're not sure which way to go
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture isn't as bleak everywhere in the Bay Area. For
instance:
</P>
<P>
   _Presentation High School, an all-girls Catholic school in San
Jose, has students flocking to take its computer-art and desktop
publishing courses. It expanded its programming class from 20 to 30
students this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of our graduates just wrote to tell me they've decided to
major in computer science because of our programming class,'' said
Adrienne Renner, technology coordinator at Presentation High.
</P>
<P>
   _Alvarado Elementary School in Union City launched an
after-school computer academy several years ago just for girls _
and the girls ended up teaching the rest of their classmates, male
and female, how to use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _Two dozen girls took part in an all-girls computer camp last
summer run by a Burlingame nonprofit called the Backyard Project.
Several now are working on after-school computer projects and
planning to major in computer science in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to look at what computers are doing to the world
around us,'' said Roma Jhaveri, a senior at Carlmont High who
attended that  &LR; the computer camp and wants to pursue a career in
technology. ``They're revolutionizing the world. I want to be part
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the Bay Area, the most ambitious initiatives to involve
girls in computers are coming from all-girl schools like
Presentation High and from nonprofit groups focused on girls, such
as the AAUW, Backyard Project or the YWCA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of work with low-income girls who don't have
computers at home and who have had no reason to think this field is
accessible to them,'' said Lauren Creamer of the Mid-Peninsula YWCA
in Palo Alto, which will hold a daylong technology workshop for
girls next month. ``We want to give them another option for their
lives besides cosmetology.''
</P>
<P>
   At coed public schools, the picture is much more spotty. Some
schools have individual teachers like Tingey who make an effort to
reach out to girls, but many don't.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools, like Alvarado Elementary, launch programs for
girls but drop them a couple of years later when funding runs out
or priorities change.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, few high-tech companies have taken a lead role in
trying to bridge the computer gender gap in schools.
</P>
<P>
   One local exception is Autodesk, which offers internship and
mentoring programs aimed specifically at girls.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers remain appalled at how little coordinated effort
is being made to give girls the technical skills that will be
central to the 21st century economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I was discouraged by was the lack of a lot of outcry
after the AAUW report,'' said Roberta Furger, a contributing editor
at PC World who recently wrote a book titled, ``Does Jane
Compute?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame to think that because of the choices we let girls
make in middle school or high school, they're closing off options
they might otherwise explore in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more optimistic. They predict that educators will
rally to close the computer gender gap the same way they rallied to
increase girls' participation in math and science classes.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, numerous teachers and schools mounted
special efforts to keep girls involved in math and science
throughout high school. Those efforts paid off: The AAUW's recent
report noted that more girls enrolled in classes such as chemistry,
algebra and calculus in 1994 than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we pushed in chemistry, biology and math, the numbers
have become close to even,'' said Jo Sanders, a researcher at the
Washington Research Institute in Seattle who has studied girls and
computers for more than a decade. ``Some things just need pushing,
and this is one of them.''

 CHRON - GIRLS SIDE  
 HOW TEACHERS ARE GETTING GIRLS PSYCHED UP ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENCE  &HT;     BY Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the secret to bridging the gender gap in technology
education?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, girls often need a little extra encouragement to
become involved in computers.
</P>
<P>
   That can take the form of individualized recruitment, like
teacher Richard Tingey does at Carlmont High School in Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   It also can take the form of girls-only computer clubs or
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought an all-girls camp was going to be horrible, but it
was fun,'' said Kristen Russell, a Carlmont High senior who
attended just such a program an all-girls computer camp  &LR; last
summer run by the Backyard Project. ``It's less intimidating trying
to speak up. It's easier to ask questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less judgmental,'' added another camp attendee, Christina
Louie.
</P>
<P>
   Once they've managed to get girls into a computer club or class,
educators suggest a variety of teaching tactics:
</P>
<P>
   _Bringing women programmers into the classroom as role models.
</P>
<P>
   _Defusing girls' fears that they may break the computers by
experimenting or tinkering with them. For instance, Cathaleen (CQ)
 &LR; Hampton forced the members of her girls' computer club at Alvarado
Elementary School to solve small computer glitches themselves
rather than automatically asking for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we started the academy, if there was a problem, they
were not comfortable attacking it themselves,'' Hampton said. ``I
called it a `learned helplessness.' So I had them work on fixing
little things like unplugged keyboards.''
</P>
<P>
   _Encouraging students to work together to solve computer
problems _ an approach that is more appealing to girls than the
stereotype of the lone programmer glued to a terminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computing should be a social activity and feature
communication just as much as the speedy finding of immense numbers
of resources,'' said Cornelia Brunner, associate director of the
Center for Children and Technology in New York.
</P>
<P>
   _Helping girls become technology leaders who train their
classmates or help run the school network.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can explain something to someone else, it does wonders
to boost your confidence,'' said Jennifer McGrath, a Stanford
University graduate student who has taught at both coed and
all-girl computer camps.
</P>
<P>
   _Integrating computer skills into other subjects such as history
or biology.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly important, researchers say, because girls
get excited about computers when they see how they can be used to
accomplish real-world goals.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, computer camp alumnae Russell and Louie currently
are involved in an after-school project building a Web site to
promote a documentary film on successful businesswomen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; And at Presentation High School, a girls' school in San Jose,
students use computers in every aspect of academic life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our students use the computer for everything they do here,''
said Adrienne Renner, the school's technology coordinator. ``They
use the Internet for research, Powerpoint for oral reports,
multimedia programs for multimedia presentations. Girls take to it
like water, and it becomes just another tool.''

<P>
   MILLBROOK, N.Y. _ It was a damp, chilly Saturday morning, and
like clockwork, the hunters began gathering in a grassy lot near
the Why Not Farm, surrounded by acres of brown pleated fields
undulating into the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, assuredly, in crisp jackets of scarlet or black, they
got out of their Jaguars and Porsches and onto their Irish sport
horses. And approaching from a distance, in perfect formation, was
a pack of three dozen foxhounds, anticipating the tremolo sounds of
an English hunting horn.
</P>
<P>
   It was time once again for the Millbrook Hunt, which for 90
years has been a fixture of this Dutchess County village as a nod
to the traditional English sport of fox hunting and a celebration
of the good American country life. It is a community event, as well
_ so much so that the hunt now has permission to cross more than
50,000 acres of private land, or more than three times the area of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are on a horse, hunting foxes, you're back in time,
like you're in the 1700's or 1800's,'' said Shepherd Ellenberg, a
58-year-old real estate investor, who was kissing his young horse,
New Castle, imported from Ireland. ``You're not thinking about the
real world. You don't have cell phones. You don't see the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   If not quite under siege, the Millbrook Hunt is under pressure.
Its traditions _ largely based on tacit agreements among
like-minded landowners in this wealthy patch of rural New York _
have recently been challenged, not only by a messy property rights
lawsuit, but also by some animal-rights advocates who have
abandoned their long-held neutrality and begun siding with the
foxes.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, the hunt has been sparring in court
with Edgar O. Smith, one of the newest neighbors in the area, to
gain unfettered access to Smith's 285-acre property. Smith, a
millionaire businessman, wants to keep the hunt off most of his
property so that he can develop a nature preserve. And in late
October, Justice Judith A. Hillery of State Supreme Court in
Poughkeepsie ruled in Smith's favor.
</P>
<P>
   That decision is not the final word in this expensive battle
among the rich. But hunt members and their supporters say they fear
the case could establish a troubling precedent, not only in
Millbrook, but in other fox hunting regions around the country,
making open space not so open.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, though, the whole affair has been unsettling, if
not bewildering, to some. To these people, moving to Millbrook is
tantamount to accepting the hunt as a part of the community's
genetic makeup. To go against the hunt, they say, is to disavow the
essence of country life and miss the point of why so many treasure
Millbrook in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people pay more to be in hunt country,'' said Barbara
Agren, who said she moved to the area because of the hunt, shedding
her previous career as managing director of couture for Saks Fifth
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain tradition and lingo, and that's what we want
to uphold,'' she continued, from her perch atop her horse, Assets,
during a recent hunt. ``So why would someone want to come up here
and ruin it all for the people who enjoy it?''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and his supporters, though, say fox hunting is a fussy,
rigid sport that should be retired to stud. They say they couldn't
care less about the de rigueur diversions of the Town and Country
set, and its quaint costumes and solemn traditions strike them as
anachronistic and silly. (This is a sport, after all, whose
practitioners insist, with the sternest faces, that foxhounds
should never, ever, be called dogs.)
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1990s, critics of the hunt say, property rights and
individual freedom count more than traditions of the hunt, which
they dismiss as hidebound, elitist, even brutal.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who are used to getting what they want, but
we just can't blindly continue these traditions,'' said Smith, 60,
a shy, private man whose company buys small manufacturing companies
for long-term investment. ``Why should this handful of rich and
privileged people get on their horses with a pack of hounds and
hunt down these innocent animals and tear them to shreds for their
own amusement?''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began in 1995, when Smith bought the wooded
property, which used to be part of James Cagney's estate, from
Henry R. Kravis, the financier, for $1.45 million. An easement in
the deed required Smith to allow the Millbrook Hunt on his property
for $1 a year _ just as Kravis had done. One clause, though,
permitted Smith to ``modify'' or ``redirect'' any trails for
property improvements.
</P>
<P>
   To Smith this meant that he could develop his nature preserve,
as a tribute to his rural upbringing on a Pennsylvania dairy farm.
So Smith put up wire fences with red streamers.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt sued, saying that if its members couldn't cut through
Smith's land, the entire hunt would be severely curbed. Smith then
offered to open 77 acres to the hunt as a compromise; this was
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Smith's lawyers presented evidence that the hunt had
ventured onto Smith's property at most about five times a year
since 1980 _ making access hardly an absolute necessity. So Justice
Hillery sided with Smith, granting the hunt 77 acres of access and
awarding Smith $47,000 in damages from the hunt's use of his
property.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment could still be appealed. And Smith is still seeking
to recover more than $1 million in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   There is more, however, to the Millbrook case than the judgment
for Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Before this case, animal rights groups in this country had paid
scant attention to the sport, since its practitioners in the United
States have long insisted that the goal of the hunt is the chase,
not the kill. But now, advocates for animals say they will make it
a higher priority.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is a turning point,'' said Wayne Pacelle, senior
vice president for the Humane Society of the United States, the
country's biggest animal protection group. ``It makes fox hunting
look like less of a benign social activity, and more like an act of
deliberate animal cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Millbrook Hunt's own diaries of its activities, which
emerged during the trial, contributed to that new assessment.
Written by Betsy Park, who, as the huntsman, trains the foxhounds
year round, the entries are mostly filled with mundane observations
about the weather, the hounds, the hunt. But several entries also
hint at how difficult it can be to prevent the hounds from
attacking foxes, coyotes, deer, pheasants and other animals in
their path. Indeed, court records show that in late 1987, the
hounds maimed a family pet, a dog named Taffy.
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of the hunt's kennels, Farnham F. Collins,
joint-master of the Millbrook Hunt since 1978, defended the hunt's
record on animal welfare. Most of the time, he said, the hounds
don't catch the foxes, or any other creature. In 20 years, only 13
foxes and 20 coyotes have been killed during the hunt, and most of
them were diseased, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Collins added, the Millbrook area is one in which
people love their animals. Veterinary clinics abound. One sign
says: ``Caution: Geese and Quackers.'' And forget ``Ped Xing''
signs; the thing to spot around here is ``Horse Xing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is another sign _ one that forbids all riding on a
particular property, with the exception of the Millbrook Hunt _
that underscores just how ingrained, and influential, the sport is
in a place that some describe, simply, as hunt country.
</P>
<P>
   Three times a week, from August to February, the hunt trots out
its brand of pomp and sport for anywhere from one and one-half to
five hours. An annual membership costs $3,600; the 70 or so active
members are split evenly between full-time residents and those who
call Millbrook a weekend retreat.
</P>
<P>
   During the hunt, accomplished male riders wear scarlet coats,
called Pinks, with brass buttons featuring the inscribed initials
``M.H.'' Accomplished female riders wear black coats with green
collars, with black buttons and white lettering. Everyone else
usually wears black coats with black buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are an old-style, traditional hunt,'' said Collins, a
stoic, deliberate man whose father and grandfather were also
joint-masters of the Millbrook Hunt. ``Some people may say, `Why
don't you go out in a sweater or something?' I would be embarrassed
in this community to put the hunt out in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Community cooperation has always been the key to the hunt's
survival, Collins said. While the hunt owns only about 20 acres of
property in the area, it has oral agreements with 92 out of 100
property owners to hunt on their lands. The eight others have
easements in their deeds allowing the same, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   And regardless of whether one is a member or not, the hunt has
never had a problem with any residents, Collins said. Not with Fred
Drasner, chief executive of The Daily News; not with Elizabeth
Johnson, an heir to the Johnson &AMP; Johnson fortune; not with
Oakleigh B. Thorne, a businessman who is one of the wealthiest men
in America.
</P>
<P>
   No one, that is, until Smith came along.
</P>
<P>
   A man who looks more like a genial park ranger than a hard-nosed
Harvard businessman, Smith said he planned to fight the hunt to the
end, no matter what the cost. Eventually, he plans to donate his
estate to animal rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Smith has been working hard on his nature preserve.
With the help of Joseph Bridges, a biologist and environmental
consultant, he has already begun to remove weeds and other invasive
plants in order to bring back native species, like prairie grass
and chestnut groves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm not some guy who came up to buy some land and
deprive the hunt of a fraction of the 60,000 acres they can hunt,''
Smith said on a recent tour of his property. ``I just wanted a
beautiful piece of land that I can celebrate and conserve and walk
through.''
</P>
<P>
   He approached a crunchy, yellowed field of harvested corn. From
that vantage point, all the land that one could see belonged to
him. And on this day, at least, there were no horses or foxhounds
in sight.

<P>
   Merwin Kaminstein, a former retail executive, died on Dec. 21 at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Kaminstein, a resident of
Boston and Bonita Springs, Fla., was 63.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his niece, Gail Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Kaminstein headed several department-store companies starting in
1971, when he became president of Donaldson's, part of Allied
Department Stores. From 1976 to 1979, he was president of another
Allied store chain, Jordan Marsh. He also served as president of
Filene's and Rich's department stores, both owned by Federated
Department Stores, between 1979 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, after two years in the real-estate industry, Kaminstein
was named chairman and chief executive at Brookstone, a chain of
specialty stores based in Nashua, N.H. He retired as chief
executive in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Hofstra University in 1956, Kaminstein
began his career in retail at Abraham &AMP; Straus in New York, worked
at Federated's headquarters in New York from 1967 to 1971 and then
joined Donaldson's.
</P>
<P>
   Kaminstein is survived by his wife, Janet, of Boston and Bonita
Springs; two daughters, Susan Street of Atlanta and Ann, of
Washington; two sons, Greg, of New Boston, N.H., and Steve, of
Noxen, Pa.; a sister, Nancy Tulis of Atlanta, and four
grandchildren.

EDWIN EVARISTE MOISE, 79, MATHEMATICS SCHOLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Mich., Mass., S.C.)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edwin Evariste Moise, distinguished professor of
mathematics emeritus at Queens College and an author of textbooks,
who helped decipher German and Japanese military signals in World
War II, died Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 79 and lived
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications following heart surgery, his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moise (pronounced mo-EEZ) specialized in topology, the
mathematical study of those properties of geometric figures that
remain unchanged under distortion, as with a Mobius strip.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote ``Introductory Problem Courses in Analysis and
Topology'' (Springer, 1982), ``Elementary Geometry from an Advanced
Standpoint'' (Addison Wesley, 3rd ed., 1990), ``Number Systems of
Elementary Math'' (Addison Wesley, 1966), ``Calculus, Part I''
(Addison Wesley, 1966) and other textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Moise served on the faculty of Queens College from 1971 until
1987, and then devoted his time to studying 19th-century English
poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New Orleans, Moise graduated from Tulane University in
1940 and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of
Texas in 1947. During World War II, as a cryptanalyst in the Office
of the Chief of Naval Operations, he decoded enemy communications.
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1960, Moise taught at the University of Michigan,
eventually becoming a professor. He was a professor of mathematics
at Harvard University before arriving at Queens College.
</P>
<P>
   He was a temporary member of the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, N.J., (1949-51), and was also president of the
Mathematical Association of America and vice president of the
American Mathematical Society, as well as a fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Moise is survived by Mary Leake Moise, whom he married in 1942;
a daughter, Claire Moise of Manhattan; a son, Edwin, of Clemson,
S.C.; and a grandson.

EX-EMPLOYEE TAKES ON INTEL IN COURT BATTLE OVER E-MAIL &HT;    BY DAN FOST
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - INTEL  c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle &HT;    Citrus Heights, Sacramento County _ Ken Hamidi was living the
<TEXT>
American dream, the one he fantasized about when he was a young man
in Tehran.
<P>
   He had a great engineering job with a company he loved, Intel
Corp. He traveled all over the world. He lived in a big house on
3.8 acres with a private lake.
</P>
<P>
   The dream didn't last. In the aftermath of a job-related auto
accident eight years ago and a bitter workers' compensation fight,
he lost his health, his job, his house. He declared bankruptcy,
mulled suicide, checked into a psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But he still believed in the American dream. And now, as the
zealous foe of the company he once loved, Hamidi is locked in
constitutional battle against Intel of Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Hamidi has the right to send thousands of
e-mails critical of Intel directly to Intel employees at their
offices.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that some First Amendment advocates fear could have a
broad chilling effect on free speech on the Internet, Intel already
has won a court order forbidding Hamidi from sending any more mass
e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The case has pitted the world's most dominant maker of computer
chips, with revenues of $25 billion a year, against a bitter,
bankrupt ex-employee who can't even afford legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But in a way, Hamidi presents a formidable match.
</P>
<P>
   He was well-trained by Intel, and in his current battle, he is
calling on the very qualities that the company values.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he is rigidly determined. Dave Hurd, a
Placerville attorney who has been helping him pro bono, refers to
his ``maniacal devotion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am obsessed,'' Hamidi said. ``Obsessed with freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Obsessed, also, with Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Like Intel's Chairman Andy Grove, who wrote ``Only the Paranoid
Survive,'' Hamidi maintains an abiding wariness. (Investigators
hired by Intel captured Hamidi on videotape changing tires, at a
time when Hamidi pursued a workers' compensation claim against the
company; he believes that the investigators slashed his tires to
obtain the footage.)
</P>
<P>
   Also like Grove, who is a former Hungarian refugee, Hamidi is an
immigrant who achieved success in America that he could only dream
of in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Ken Hamidi is not Andy Grove. Grove's brilliance is
legendary, and during his tenure as Intel's chief executive,
revenues grew eightfold and the stock price grew 120 times. He
escaped first the Nazis and then the Communists; today, he holds
roughly $250 million in Intel stock.
</P>
<P>
   Hamidi said he earned $50,000 in his peak days at Intel, which
is not even particularly high by engineering standards.
</P>
<P>
   Court records in Hamidi's workers' compensation case indicate
that he has had some problems telling the truth. The state Workers'
Compensation Appeals Board found that Hamidi had lied to his
doctors numerous times. The board also found that he had lied on a
home-loan application, in a letter to a court seeking dismissal of
a speeding ticket and even in a deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The board said Hamidi covered up business failures, a lawsuit
his wife had filed, his wife's miscarriage, the extent of his
disability, his reckless driving and the circumstances under which
he lost his home.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hamidi offered various explanations for his statements,
including his desperation to keep his job and to gain his doctors'
sympathy, he also said his honesty is not at issue in this latest
case, as both he and Intel agree that he sent the offending
e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   In the case at hand, Intel does not make an issue of the content
of Hamidi's e-mail. But outside the courtroom, the company says
Hamidi _ in his e-mail and on his Web site at
 &LR; www.igc.apc.org/faceintel/ &LR;  _ is spreading lies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while Intel recently announced it would reduce its
workforce by 3,000 people, in an e-mail Hamidi insists that the
actual number is 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter on the Web site, he tells Intel CEO Craig
Barrett: ``Mr. Barrett, if you really want to thank and appreciate
your employees just stop lying to them, cheating them, and do not
axe them to show higher profits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had people named in there who are defamed,'' said Coeta
Chambers, Intel's human resources attorney. But suing Hamidi for
defamation is ``a much more difficult issue,'' she said. ``If you
sue over the Web site, all that would do is draw more attention to
the Web site. Then he would withdraw the material that was
defamatory. He would repost it and change one or two words to say,
`This is my opinion.'''
</P>
<P>
   Intel has asked Sacramento Superior Court Judge John R. Lewis
for summary judgment. On December 18, Lewis set a court date of
April 15 to give Hamidi time for discovery.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Hamidi may have legal counsel. The American Civil
Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation will meet
next month to decide whether they want to jump into the case on his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Hamidi is a handsome, well-dressed man. At 51, some gray has
crept into his temples, but the rest of his perfectly combed hair
remains inky black.
</P>
<P>
   He rents a comfortable two-story stucco house on a corner lot in
Citrus Heights, a Sacramento suburb 10 miles from Intel's Folsom
campus, where he used to work. In one living room, a Persian rug
and a Christmas tree accent tasteful decorations. Down a few steps
in another living room, his daughter and two friends cuddle on a
couch and watch a wide-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, Hamidi maintains a small cluttered office. News
clippings of his fight against Intel are piling up. At his Compaq
computer, he works on his Web page for his loosely knit
organization, Former and Current Employees of Intel, or FACE Intel,
which he says has about 100 participants.
</P>
<P>
   As he discusses his case, he lapses into cliches. He evokes 1776
and the American revolution and says he's a ``pioneer on the new
frontier, the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is going to determine if all of us, if any one of
us, have any right to freedom of speech on the Internet or not,''
Hamidi said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many immigrants, he believes that Americans take their
freedom for granted. As a naturalized U.S. citizen, he attributes
his fervor to his experiences in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy in Tehran, Hamidi's father was a real estate agent and
his mother a housewife. He married his high school sweetheart in
1971, and they now have two daughters, ages 23 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Iranian Air Force when he was about 20 years old.
He said he signed up for a four-year tour of duty but was kept in
beyond that term and fought for eight years to get out.
</P>
<P>
   He ultimately left the Air Force in 1978 at age 31. With his
wife and daughter, he moved to California and became a travel agent
specializing in trips to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  By the following year, the Shah of Iran had been toppled and
U.S. embassy employees were taken hostage. Although Hamidi was
safely in the United States, his travel business shriveled:
Iranians were no longer visiting their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   He took night classes at National University in Sacramento,
earning a bachelor's degree in manufacturing technology and a
master's in business administration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, he started work at Intel's Folsom plant as Intel's
liaison to European automakers, selling them on using Intel chips
in their cars and resolving manufacturing problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very sensitive work, and I was very good at it,'' he
said. ``I worked very, very long hours. I was extremely dedicated
and extremely loyal to the company. I loved Intel very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel attorney Chambers wouldn't discuss Hamidi's work record,
except to say there were ``no employment issues.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While at Intel, Hamidi bought a 4,200-square-foot house in
Loomis, on 3.8 fully landscaped acres with a small lake, a boat, a
waterfall. He had a 2,500-square-foot barn, three cars, a truck,
two tractors and animals.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 20, 1990, as he drove back from a conference in
Arizona, his car was rear-ended. ``Unfortunately, I was still at
work,'' he said. ``I was on company time. And that is what
destroyed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite back and neck injuries, he didn't take leave from his
job, he said, working for 18 months even though he was taking large
doses of the pain-killer Vicodin and suffering from sleep
deprivation, pain and depression.
</P>
<P>
   His duties were reduced, and he ultimately went on leave. In
1995, Intel notified him that he was terminated.
</P>
<P>
   He fought back, filing a wrongful-termination suit, which he
later withdrew, and a workers' compensation suit. Although he won
the first round of the workers' compensation claim, Intel won on
appeal, and Hamidi's appeal to a higher court was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamidi had other weapons, especially as the Internet sprang
to life. He began to attack Intel on his Web page, and he
periodically sent mass e-mails to Intel employees.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has cut off employees' access to his Web site, and each
time he sent an e-mail, Intel then blocked mail from that server.
But Hamidi, undaunted, kept using different computers and host
accounts to send his messages.
</P>
<P>
   When Hamidi sent his sixth e-mail, in March, Intel warned him to
stop. In October, he sent a seventh message, to about 29,000
employees, and Intel filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is all he has at the moment; his wife works part time,
and he is unemployed and still taking Vicodin. He's probably
unemployable because of his increasing notoriety _ What company
would look at Hamidi's Web site and invite him to work for them?
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: Why does he do it? Why doesn't he move
on with his life? How can he spend his daughters' college-education
money in order to pursue his quest?
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened to a person who is passionate about his
freedom,'' Hamidi said. ``I am not only concerned with material
things. I have the desire, drive and determination of a pioneer. I
talked to my family. I will fight this injustice up to the point
I'm alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I can live with myself,'' Hamidi said, ``is if I
fight.''

 CHRON - INTEL  
CRUX OF INTEL CASE _ IS IT SPAM OR TRESPASSING? &HT;    By Dan Fost
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR; In Internet jargon, spam is defined as massive, unsolicited
commercial e-mail. Most Internet users agree: Spam is bad.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's protected as free speech under the Constitution and
whether it can be defined by its content, are questions that are
arising in legislatures and, possibly, in court as part of the case
of Intel Corp. versus Ken Hamidi.
</P>
<P>
   On seven occasions, Hamidi sent mass e-mails to as many as
29,000 Intel employees. He wasn't hawking pornography or
get-rich-quick schemes, the most common types of spam.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he offered his spin on Intel policies and actions _ and
Intel found his opinions as obnoxious as any smutty spam.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Intel doesn't like what Hamidi has to say, however,
the company's lawsuit is not focusing on his content. Instead,
Intel claims that Hamidi's spam trespasses into the company's
computer system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he's crossed that line between free speech and
invasion of private property,'' said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil
Liberties Union are considering entering the case on Hamidi's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see it as spam,'' said Shari Steele, an attorney with
the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation. ``We see it
as Intel upset about someone with a message for their employees. It
wasn't like he was using their resources. He didn't hack into their
system. He used the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel human resources attorney Coeta Chambers said that just
because the company is connected to the Internet ``does not
transform our workplace into a public forum, any more than the fact
that I can drive onto a city street means you can drive onto our
property and distribute leaflets.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hamidi were to send his messages via the U.S. Postal Service
_ ``snail mail,'' in the lingo of the digerati _ Chambers said
Intel would not be obliged to deliver it to employees. ``We're not
required to use our internal system to deliver mail to
individuals,'' Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be true, said Barry Steinhardt, the outgoing president
of the EFF and an associate director of the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nor are they under obligation to deliver his electronic
mail,'' Steinhardt said. ``The question is, could they go to court
prohibiting Hamidi from using the U.S. Postal Service to deliver
his mail? The question is, can Intel invoke the power of the
government?''
</P>
<P>
   Steele, the EFF attorney, said Hamidi's case is different than a
typical spam case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when you are talking about spam, you are talking about
a marketer who doesn't really know the people he's sending messages
to. The message is random,'' she said. ``This was a directed
mailing. It was not for marketing purposes. Instead, it was a
criticism.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  A SECOND HAS INTESTINAL SURGERY; TWO OTHERS BACK ON VENTILATORS
<TEXT>
<P>
   By T.J. MILLING &QL; 
c. 1998
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOUSTON CHRONICLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The tiniest of Houston's octuplets, the girl Chijindu
Chidera, whose name meant ``God has my life,'' died Sunday, while a
sister recovered from surgery and two other siblings had to be put
back on ventilators.
</P>
<P>
   The other four were breathing on their own but still in critical
condition, according to a Texas Children's Hospital statement.
Mother Nkem Chukwu was strong enough to visit her infants shortly
before her fifth-born, nicknamed Odera, died of heart and lung
failure at 3:23 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very saddened by the passing of our beloved baby,
Odera,'' said a statement from Chukwu and the octuplets' father,
Iyke Louis Udobi. ``She is now safe with God in heaven, and we
remain most grateful to Him for having blessed our lives with hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sincere gratitude goes out to the doctors, nurses,
therapists and others who worked tirelessly to help Odera in her
battle for life against what turned out to be overwhelming
obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   Odera, who weighed 10.3 ounces or 320 grams at birth, was the
size of a Beanie Baby, doctors have said _ 124 grams lighter than
the smallest baby ever to survive at Texas Children's.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors believe her underdevelopment may have been caused by
crowding in her mother's womb.
</P>
<P>
   Odera's condition began to deteriorate Saturday afternoon, the
hospital statement said, six days after she, four sisters and two
brothers were born by Caesarean section. Another girl was born
naturally two weeks before the seven, making them the first known
set of surviving octuplets.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had moved Odera from a conventional ventilator to an
oscillator in an attempt to increase the oxygen in her blood, the
statement said. The treatment failed, her heartbeat began to slow,
and neither medication nor manual chest compression could save her.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the youngest infant, Gorom, was recovering from
surgery Saturday to repair a hole in her intestine, the statement
said. In addition, Ebuka, the girl born Dec. 8, and Ikem, the first
boy born Dec. 20, had to be put back on mechanical respirators.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu had miscarried triplets earlier this year. Like the
octuplets, they were the product of powerful fertility drugs,
doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Fertility specialists maintain that improper administration of
the drugs is to blame for multiple fetuses that pose major health
threats to mother and children.
</P>
<P>
   When Chukwu became pregnant again with so many embryos, she was
referred to obstetrician/gynecologist Brian Kirshon, who
specializes in high-risk births at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital.
Kirshon has said that Chukwu was offered a ``reduction'' _ a
procedure to remove some of the embryos to give the others a better
chance of surviving _ but declined.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu, 29, and Udobi, 41, whose name appears as Iyke Paul Louis
Jr. on his driver's license, are naturalized U.S. citizens from
Nigeria. He has said that they were married about five years ago in
ceremonies both in Nigeria and before a judge here.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 22, when Chukwu was four months' pregnant with the
octuplets, Udobi was charged with misdemeanor assault in an
incident involving Chukwu's mother, Janet.
</P>
<P>
   Houston police records show that he was arrested at the couple's
home in the 8600 block of Dawnridge on suspicion of hitting and
biting Janet Chukwu and of threatening to break Nkem Chukwu's hands
and kick her in the back.
</P>
<P>
   He was released on $1,500 bail a week later. Trial is set for
Feb. 8. The maximum punishment for a conviction would be a year in
jail and a $4,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Udobi has called the incident a misunderstanding that was worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks after the incident, Chukwu was admitted to St.
Luke's and put on drugs to stop her uterus from contracting,
doctors have said. She also was kept on an incline with her head
down to take pressure off her cervix and delay birth as long as
possible, which would improve the infants' chances of survival.

THE NET FILES/JON SWARTZ  
 EXPERTS GIVE GLIMPSE INTO NET'S FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - THE NET FILES   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The information age is on the cusp of the millennium. Are you
ready for robotic Internet search engines, voice-activated Web
surfing and airtight online security?
</P>
<P>
   Before you laugh off these potential technical advances as
sci-fi drivel, consider this: Many of these ideas and concepts are
being hashed out by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an
international organization of 250 companies, government agencies
and universities that sets the technical blueprints for many of the
Internet's advances.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft, IBM and others closely follow the W3C and
produce their own products based on its schematics.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, we asked Web luminaries to drag out their
crystal balls and offer a glimpse into the immediate future. Here
is what they see:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Bots.  &LR; Imagine individualized search engines on personal
computers that roam the vast expanses of cyberspace in search of
specific information on other personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   A user in San Jose, for example, would program their PC to find
references to 1962 Ferrari GTO models for sale. Meanwhile, users in
other parts of the country who are attempting to sell that model
would program their computers to find prospective online buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines powered by independent agents on each PC then
would index information over the Web and make a match between
corresponding computers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``bot'' concept, short for robotic computers, isn't too
farfetched, says Tim Berners-Lee, the MIT professor who is one of
the Web's founders. He calls the technology illustrative of the
so-called Phase II of Internet communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phase I is about people communicating over the Web,''
Berners-Lee says. ``Phase II is about computers interacting with
one another over the Net with no human intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Security.  &LR; W3C currently is working on something called
Platform for Privacy Preference, which will allow Netizens to
dictate how much information is collected by Internet service
providers about their online shopping habits, according to
Berners-Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Berners-Lee says online security is now more of a
dilemma for governments because individuals can communicate
secretly. ``It's nearly impossible for somebody else to find out
what you're saying,'' he says. ``The biggest problem with applying
security isn't that the technology isn't strong enough _ it's that
governments are so frightened of it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; XML.  &LR; Widely regarded as the successor to HTML, the Web's
``lingua franca,'' XML is a formatting language for ``tagging''
documents. It will let consumers perform detailed online searches
at neck-snapping speed and efficiency, says Don DePalma, an analyst
at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Web surfers will be able to conduct extremely narrow searches,
DePalma says, because specific items will be listed under themed
categories. For example, someone looking just for search results on
the movie ``Frenzy'' would click on a topic group called ``Alfred
Hitchcock.''
</P>
<P>
   This technology already is in limited used by search engines and
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Work-flow technology. &LR;  Software that automates business
operations eventually will be heavily used to expedite Web
site-publishing processes.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; High-tech hodgepodge.  &LR; Other potential technologies on the
horizon: voice-activated software for Web surfing, and
more-sophisticated server software for e-commerce transactions.
Market researchers also predict a quantum leap in blur-fast cable
modem sales next year, from about 500,000 units in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Whiz-bang &UR;  &LR; gadgetry aside, Internet observers caution that
consumers shouldn't get too caught up in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations and consumers are equally concerned about
increasing the Net's stability before making technological
advances,'' DePalma adds. ``They want to make the best use of
existing technology.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Cyber bumper sticker.  &LR; Speaking of the immediate future, a San
Francisco man with no political affiliation to Vice President Al
Gore has registered the following domain names:  &LR; gorebradley.org &LR; , &LR; 
gorebradley2000.org &LR; ,  &LR; gorefeinstein.org &LR; ,
 &LR; gorefeinstein2000.org &LR; , &LR;  goredaley.org &LR; ,  &LR; goredaley2000.org &LR; ,
 &LR; gorekerry.org &LR;  and &LR;  gorekerry2000.org &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   His point? Ted Weinstein, a 36-year-old high-tech communications
consultant, spent about $1,000 for the naming rights before they
got into the hands of political dirty tricksters. And he wants to
pass them onto Gore, an early champion of the Web _ but not
necessarily a practitioner of registering domain names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised that someone touting himself as Mr. Tech Savvy
has not locked up these names for use on the Web during the 2000
presidential campaign,'' Weinstein said. ``Gore has been prepping
(for the presidency) his whole life, and yet he has ignored a basic
element of his campaign. I'd just like to pass these names on to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez, my 67-year-old father has his own domain name,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   A vice presidential spokesman did not return phone calls.
</P>

   NEW YORK _ More money than ever is pouring into New York's state
and local election campaigns, but the system of regulating these
funds to curb their influence on politics and policy has all but
broken down.
</P>
<P>
   Porous laws, feeble enforcement and a political class
increasingly adept at sidestepping the rules have left the system
with few constraints, even by comparison to those of other states
and the federal government, according to a review of campaign
documents and interviews with elected officials and others.
</P>
<P>
   New York has rejected many of the laws adopted elsewhere, from
bans on donations by corporations and labor unions to publicly
financed campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of this year's contests, the most expensive in state
history, shows a virtual free-for-all of donating and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Financier Ronald Perelman channeled more than $200,000 on two
days last August to Gov. George Pataki's campaign, using a common
loophole to give more than seven times the legal limit for an
individual donor. A Long Island company, Silverite Construction,
gave at least $20,000 over the legal limit, just as it was awarded
a $97 million state contract. The company was not punished.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, a Kentucky-based manufacturer of computer printers,
Lexmark International, donated $45,000 to three Republican
committees while it was trying to defeat a bill that threatened its
business. The legislation died in the Republican-controlled state
Senate. The money, said company spokesman Jim Joseph, ``helps you
get someone's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   There are even fewer controls on how politicians spend
donations. Brooklyn Democratic Assemblyman Dov Hikind used $100,000
of campaign contributions to pay lawyers who defended him in a
criminal bribery case. Assemblyman Anthony Seminerio, a Queens
Democrat, had his campaign buy a $25,OOO Ford Crown Victoria for
his full-time use. The campaign of state Senator Guy Velella, a
Bronx Republican, bought an alarm system for his home. And state
Senator Serphin Maltese, a Queens Republican, took a two-week trip
to Italy, paid for with campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York state campaign finance laws are atrocious,'' said
John Feerick, dean of the Fordham Law School, who led a state
commission in the 1980s that recommended more stringent campaign
finance laws, only to be rebuffed by the legislature. ``And if
anything, it seems pretty clear to me that things have gotten
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Pataki has declared the campaign finance laws ``dreadful.''
He made his pronouncement during his re-election campaign, in which
he set a record by spending nearly $20 million, much of it
collected from donors with business before the state.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are New York's laws weaker than many other states have,
but so is its enforcement. In California, New Jersey and many other
states, special agencies police campaign financs, but New York
gives the job to the politically paralyzed State Board of
Elections, whose focus is overseeing registration and balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The board collected roughly $20,000 in fines in 1997 for
campaign violations. Its counterpart in California collected more
than $650,000 in fines that year.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, politicians sometimes seem to mock
public-disclosure rules. Pataki used to file his contributors
listed alphabetically by first name, making analysis difficult.
This fall, his campaign submitted a list of nearly $4 million in
expenditures in type so small that much of it was, for all
practical purposes, unreadable. The state plans to put the records
in a computer next year, long after other states have done so with
similar records.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure rules in other states require politicians to detail
donors' occupations and employers, as well as whether the donors do
business with the state. New York lacks these requirements.
</P>
<P>
   New York's race for governor this year cost $40 million, up from
$32 million in 1994. Legislative campaign committees raised more
than $8 million, roughly double the total in 1994. Overall,
candidates and political committees in New York have spent more
than $200 million on state and local campaigns over the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, Perelman, who controls Revlon, easily skirted
the limits on donations.
</P>
<P>
   By law, a corporation's donations to all state and local
candidates and political committees can generally not exceed a
total of $5,000 annually. And a gubernatorial campaign can accept
no more than $28,000 from an individual contributor in a general
election.
</P>
<P>
   So how can one person give more than $200,000? In Perelman's
case, he divided it among more than 40 corporations that he
controls, each of which gave $5,000. In doing so, he also got
around a rule that limits individuals to an aggregate maximum of
$150,000 a year in donations.
</P>
<P>
   The state has never deemed this practice illegal even though
other jurisdictions prohibit it.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the only way around corporate limits: Just like on
the federal level, corporations can donate unlimited amounts of
so-called soft money, which political parties can legally use only
for ``party building'' activities, like get-out-the-vote drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Elections, though, does not monitor how the state
parties handle soft money. In fact, the Republican State Committee
has raised $7.5 million in soft money since 1995 and transferred
most of it to a federal political account in Washington, putting it
outside the jurisdiction of the state board.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, corporations are able to violate the $5,000 limit
without much risk of being caught. Board officials concede that
they have no idea how many corporations break the law because they
do not monitor campaign reports for local candidates. In addition,
the board routinely declines to recommend punishment for violators
if they say they did not know about the law.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of states put no limits on contributions. But most
of those, including Texas, bar all contributions from corporations
and unions.
</P>
<P>
   New York is even more lenient with unions than it is with
corporations. Unions are held to the same contribution limits as
individual donors, allowing them to become major players in Albany.
Since 1995, for example, the state teachers union has donated $1.25
million to the committees run by the legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a growing number of states, New York allows fund-raising
by legislators while they are in session. It is common in Albany
for lobbyists to attend fund-raisers at night where they contribute
to the same legislators they buttonhole about bills during the day.
More than 200 such events were held in the state capital this year.
</P>
<P>
   The state law governing the spending of campaign donations is
terse yet expansive. ``Contributions received by a candidate or a
political committee may be expended for any lawful purpose,'' it
says. ``Such funds shall not be converted by any person to a
personal use which is unrelated to a political campaign or the
holding of a public office or party position.''
</P>
<P>
   With those guidelines, politicians can justify virtually any
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   Many legislators lease cars year-round _ including in
non-election years _ then charge the cost to their campaigns and
drive the vehicles on personal as well as political or governmental
matters. Seminerio went further and spent $25,000 in campaign money
last year on the Ford Crown Victoria. ``As an Assembly person, I'm
on like 24 hours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Hikind was indicted last year on charges of receiving
bribes from a social-services group, he hired a prominent defense
lawyer, Gustave Newman, and paid him with $100,000 in campaign
funds. Hikind, who was acquitted on all the charges, did not
respond to telephone messages seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Velella, the Bronx Republican leader, said he bought a $5,981
alarm system for his home this year after a disgruntled Republican
candidate threatened him and his wife. He said using campaign funds
was appropriate because the threats were related to his job as
senator.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 and 1995, Velella spent $30,000 in campaign money to
hire lawyers to prevent the release of a grand jury report on a
school board election. He said the report was unfair to him and his
father, Vincent, an elections commissioner in New York City.
Neither man faced charges, and the report was quashed.
</P>
<P>
   The State Board of Elections did not question these expenditures
or seek more information on them.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did it question the $2,250 in campaign money that Maltese
spent to go to Italy for a two-week trip sponsored by the New York
Conference of Italian-American Legislators. The senator's
spokeswoman said Maltese met with Italian officials to ``further
relations between the United States and Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the job of overseeing politicians' money is in the
hands of the politicians themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The State Board of Elections is run by four commissioners, two
Democrats and two Republicans. Because it takes a majority to
approve an investigation, the board rarely examines the conduct of
prominent elected or party officials. The Republicans have blocked
investigations into the propriety of the Republican State Committee
transferring millions of dollars to the Pataki campaign. The
Democrats have similarly prevented inquiries into party matters.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 30 or so campaign finance complaints were filed, and
the board investigated only a handful, officials said. The board
rarely initiates its own inquiries because it does little more than
insure that candidates and committees have filed on time and done
their math correctly. Unlike its counterparts in other states, it
does not conduct rigorous audits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything that we can do under the law,'' said Thomas
Wilkey, the board's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent campaign for state attorney general, the eventual
winner, Eliot Spitzer, a Manhattan Democrat, ran into criticism
from his rivals over whether he was receiving illegal financial
assistance from his father. Two Democratic candidates filed
complaints with the board in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The board has yet to consider the complaints, although in the
final days of the campaign, Spitzer acknowledged that he had failed
to disclose help from his father.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, election authorities can levy fines for a
variety of offenses. In New York, the law permits fines only for
breaking disclosure rules, and the board is required to ask a judge
to actually impose such penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the judges do, the fines are routinely ignored. In
1997, the board got $27,000 in fines imposed, and collected $7,000.
The remaining $13,000 or so that it received in 1997 came from
fines imposed in earlier years that were paid after the board hired
a collection agency, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For other infractions, like violating donation limits, the
board's only option is to refer cases to local district attorneys.
The district attorneys rarely if ever follow up, usually saying
they are too busy with more serious offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of enforcement by the state, federal prosecutors
have stepped in. The U.S. attorney in Brooklyn is conducting at
least four investigations of donations on the state level.
</P>
<P>
   The donations from Silverite Construction are a case study in
the system's weakness. In 1997, the company gave at least $25,000
in donations to state and local candidates, far exceeding the
$5,000 annual limit. Some of that money ended up in the coffers of
the Republican State Committee around the time that state
transportation officials awarded Silverite a $97 million project.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors began investigating the donations after The
New York Times reported on them in March 1998. The Board of
Elections later notified Silverite that it had made illegal
contributions and told the company to have the money refunded.
</P>
<P>
   Silverite has not complied, but the board cannot punish it. Nor
can it require the candidates and committees that received the
money to return it.
</P>
<P>
   All the board can do is refer the matter to the local district
attorney, which it has not yet done.
</P>
<P>
   William Fitzpatrick, district attorney in the Syracuse area,
acknowledged that district attorneys have little interest in
campaign finance enforcement. Fitzpatrick, a Republican, who is
president of the New York State District Attorneys Association,
said he and other district attorneys favored giving the Board of
Elections more power to do the job on its own.
</P>
<P>
   California, Maine, Massachusetts and Arizona passed campaign
finance reform plans through referendums put on the ballot by
advocacy groups, but that is not an option under the New York
Constitution.

COMMENTARY: SNOW ON THE SOTOL AND LECHUGUILLA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the southwestern corner of Texas, farther west than Santa Fe
and farther south than Tijuana, lies El Paso, a raw-edged city
built largely _ so it seems from the air _ of sheet-metal shoe
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio Grande snakes through the desert from Las Cruces, past
the stacks of Smeltertown, and there it becomes the border between
the United States and Mexico, between the large-scale geometry of
El Paso's industrial sector and the broken mosaic of Ciudad Juarez.
On a clear winter day, a belt of brown smog tracks the boundary
between Texas and Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   There are 49 states and then there is Texas, which, as Texans
will tell you, is another country altogether. Texas has avoided one
of the conflicts disturbing Western states like Utah and Idaho by
containing virtually no federally owned land.
</P>
<P>
   And yet if you drive southeast from El Paso toward the Chinati
Mountains, you realize that this region _ so empty of people _ is
full of federal agents trying to control the flow of illegal aliens
and illegal drugs across the border.
</P>
<P>
   This gives rise to more than one conundrum. The town of Marfa is
home, for instance, to a sublime pastel courthouse and El Cheapo
Liquor, to the Chinati Foundation _ a high-modernist museum erected
on a former Army base by the sculptor Donald Judd _ and a small
battalion of border-patrol officers.
</P>
<P>
   I drove across this trans-Pecos landscape in the near-dark
recently. The wind fell stiff out of the north, with blowing snow.
A large radar balloon, which normally flies at the end of a long
leash to detect smugglers' low-flying aircraft, sat tethered beside
the road under the orange glare of sodium lamps.
</P>
<P>
   Only the low shoulder of Chinati Peak was visible, and the
horizon had been blotted out entirely. The border-patrol inspection
station south of Marfa looked almost as welcome as an all-night
truckstop with good biscuits and gravy.
</P>
<P>
   When morning came, Presidio County lay under snow, from Chinati
Peak _ at nearly 8,000 feet _ right down into the desert canyons
near the old silver-mining town of Shafter.
</P>
<P>
   People who do not know the desert tend to think of it as a
nonseasonal, constant place. But it is constant only in its beauty.
An earlier cold snap had brought autumn to the desert just as a
sudden rain brings spring. Now the fall colors had faded from the
ocotillo, and the bare, downswept boughs of ash trees looked like a
summer cloudburst.
</P>
<P>
   The snow over the desert clarified both the colors and the forms
of its plants _ Mormon tea, sotol, lechuguilla, leatherstem,
acacias _ and the hard frost retained the tracks of javelina.
</P>
<P>
   There is something about seeing snow on an agave or a purple
prickly-pear that reminds you what an intimate place the desert is,
how subtle and specialized its effects are. Snow throws the vacancy
of the desert into relief, and you see at once how little empty
space there really is on the desert floor or its canyon walls.
Emptiness seems like the prevailing conceit of this part of Texas,
but after all it is only a misconception.

FORMER PLAYERS NOT SURPRISED BY PARCELLS' TURNAROUND
</HEADLINE>
 PARCELLS-NYT 
(With FBN-JETS-PATRIOTS)  (ms)

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ They have seen the way he puts together
a game plan and pulls every ounce of competitiveness out of his
players. They have witnessed his yelling, his cursing, his
posturing, and they have been inspired by his incredible thirst for
excellence. And they have been to the place where all of the
pressure and tension and passion he creates can get a team.
</P>
<P>
   So, no, the Patriots' Willie McGinest and Ty Law are not
surprised at what Bill Parcells has done with the New York Jets.
They expected as much when he left the New England Patriots two
years ago to resurrect one of the most dreadful clubs in the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   And though they were disappointed after Sunday's terrible
performance at Giants Stadium, the Patriots' two stalwart defenders
did not find it strange that a team with a 1-15 record in 1996
could pound them, 31-10, two seasons later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's surprised at what Bill can do,'' said Law, the
all-pro cornerback with a league-leading nine interceptions. ``He's
a great coach. He's going down as one of the greatest that ever
coached any team. He turned this team around, and he's turned the
Jets around. He's probably made two of the biggest turnarounds in
teams in football history.''
</P>
<P>
   Though McGinest and Law were not there when the best thing about
the Patriots was their colorful uniforms, they know the yarn. New
England was 9-39 in the three seasons before Parcells was hired and
in the Super Bowl four years after his arrival. And they may also
know, though they would never admit it, that since Parcells left
their sideline, the Patriots (9-7) have become inferior to the Jets
(12-4).
</P>
<P>
   Not only have the Jets under Parcells swapped places this year
with the Patriots under Parcells _ American Football Conference
East Division champions _but the Jets have a better mark over the
past two seasons. The Jets are 21-11 with Parcells, and the
Patriots, a Super Bowl team in 1996, are 19-13 without him.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's rout was the Jets' third consecutive victory over New
England. Even though the Patriots were the team playing for
home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs, the Jets
displayed the sense of urgency that is indicative of a Parcells-led
team.
</P>
<P>
   While the Jets executed with precision, the Patriots, who were
playing without the injured star quarterback Drew Bledsoe, went
through the motions like they were taking part in a pre-game
warmup.
</P>
<P>
   New England, which plays at Jacksonville on Saturday, committed
mistakes that revealed it had a letdown. Two of the most striking
gaffes were by running backs Robert Edwards and Sedrick Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Edwards, a rookie who rushed for 1,102
yards this year, broke away for a big gain and then dropped the
ball without being touched as he was racing down the sideline.
Moments later, Shaw stumbled over his in the backfield for a 2-yard
loss. Two years ago, with Parcells on the sideline, those things
probably would not have happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the aura and attitude about Parcells makes you hate to
mess up for him,'' said McGinest, a defensive end who made his only
trip to the Pro Bowl in 1996. ``He knows what he wants out of
players, and he knows how to get what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if anything about the Jets reminded him of the
Patriots of 1996, McGinest laughed and said: ``Yeah, all the
players that are over there. Half of their players used to be here,
and the whole coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' staff has six coaches and eight players who were with
Parcells in New England. One of those players is halfback Curtis
Martin, who spent his first three NFL seasons gaining 3,799 yards
for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said Parcells made it clear that half-stepping would not
be tolerated Sunday, even though the Jets had nothing to gain in
the standing or the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his relentless attitude to win, he's not going to
tolerate anything simple,'' Martin said. ``He's not going to
tolerate a team that does dumb things. His favorite quote is `Smart
players very seldom do dumb things.' He lives by that, and he makes
sure that his team lives by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Law played down the significance of facing so many former
teammates, but said that seeing Martin and the others was special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's going to bring some type of emotion,'' he
said. ``Just because we went to the Super Bowl with some of those
guys over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, largely because of Parcells, those guys may be going to the
Super Bowl without him. &QL;

IRAQ VOWS TO CANCEL OIL-FOR-FOOD PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Iraq ratcheted up its confrontation with the United
Nations Sunday, vowing to end the internationally monitored
oil-for-food program and to eject the UN personnel running it.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days after President Clinton halted a military strike
against Iraq, Saddam Hussein's government defiantly refused to make
concessions to critics and gloried in sympathetic words from a
meeting of Arab legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's pronouncement followed a threat Saturday to shoot down
US and British warplanes patrolling no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq. The United States said it would knock out Iraqi
antiaircraft batteries if fired upon.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, the White House called Iraq's latest move an
example of how the international community cares more about Iraq's
people than does Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley also said the Iraqi comments
served to justify US support for Iraqi groups seeking to topple
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we are supporting the Iraqi opposition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments, by Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, did not
specify when it would stop the humanitarian program or force out
the UN employees overseeing it. The next part of the oil-for-food
deal, created to avert hunger and disease, is scheduled to expire
in four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands the
lifting of sanctions,'' Saleh said as he called for the ``ouster''
of 400 UN personnel administering the program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to sell oil and
use the money to buy staples abroad. Iraq views the program as
interference by the United Nations, but the United States maintains
that strict controls are necessary to keep Iraq from using oil
money to buy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year-old program will allow Iraq to sell $5.2 billion in
oil in the six-month period that ends in April. One-third of the
money is reserved to pay for the UN monitors and to help victims of
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and the Persian Gulf War that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan reiterated
that antiaircraft gunners were prepared to target the American and
British planes that make regular overflights above the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violating Iraqi airspace is an aggression,'' he said. ``The
so-called farce of no-fly zones must end. The so-called no-fly
zones only exist in the British and American imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq reportedly fired at a British jet after it was out of
range, and US officials said they take the threats seriously. A
senior US official responded to Ramadan's warning by saying, ``The
Iraqis know what the rules are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As President Clinton said at the end of Desert Fox, we will
enforce the `no-fly' zone,'' the official told the Los Angeles
Times. ``Our pilots will take all actions necessary to protect
themselves, and we take this as a very serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hussein wants to maintain a sense of confrontation,'' another
senior administration official said. ``He's trying to create a
sympathy card. It also helps to keep alive a sense of Iraq, the
unconquered.''
</P>
<P>
   Other provocations, including Baghdad's rejection of all UN
weapons inspections after the punishing four-day air attacks by the
United States and Britain and its refusal last week to allow any
more UN planes to fly to Iraq, had already led Washington to
conclude that a second confrontation is virtually inevitable. The
only issues are timing and the specific flash point, The Los
Angeles Times quoted US officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The no-fly zones were established after the Persian Gulf War in
1991 to stop Saddam Hussein's air strikes against Shiite Muslims in
the south and Kurdish rebels in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has already said that it will not allow another group of UN
inspectors, who monitor arms production and storage, to return to
work.

   Legislators from 16 Arab countries harshly criticized the
70-hour bombing of Iraq, saying it made life worse for ordinary
Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aggression on Iraq represents a dangerous policy which is
against international law and shakes regional and international
security,'' Fathi Sorour, the head of the Arab Parliamentary Union,
told an emergency session of the group in Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait, which is suspicious of Hussein, did not participate. In
Cairo, a newspaper said that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
blamed Hussein for provoking the four days of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Republicans have toned down their
criticism of the airstrikes, which several leaders had suggested
were timed to deflect attention from impeachment hearings. So, too,
have officials from Republican administrations.

<P>
   Appearing on Fox News Sunday, former secretary of state Lawrence
Eagleburger said he initially found the timing odd, but was
satisfied after a talk with the current secretary, Madeleine K.

   ROME _ When Heather Parisi fainted at the end of a dance number
on a popular Italian variety show, it was reported on the front
pages of Italy's leading newspapers. Wendy Windham, a blonde and
buxom sidekick on yet another popular variety show, was mobbed by
paparazzi as she went Christmas shopping in the Piazza Navona.
Justine Mattera, who does a pale impersonation of Marilyn Monroe on
a talk show, is a household name in Italy. So is Randi Ingerman,
who recently got her own sitcom, ``Men Are All Alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, in Italy it is the American women on television who
have a lot in common. Like almost every other country in the world
except perhaps Myanmar, Italy imports a large number of U.S.
television shows, from sitcoms and soap operas, to ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   But Italian television's fondness for Americana goes a bit
further than most. Almost every variety show _ and there are dozens
_ features what Italians call a ``soubrette,'' borrowing an old
French term for a nubile maid in a theatrical comedy. On Italian
television, the ideal soubrette does not necessarily sing or dance,
but she is almost always tall, blonde and Californian, and speaks
adorably fractured Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want me to speak Italian well,'' Ms. Windham said,
explaining her job description on ``I Cervelloni,'' a popular
variety show centered around inventors and their gadgets. The other
requirements are that she wear sparkling gowns with slits and
plunging decollete, and smile while the host, Giancarlo Magalli _
who is plump, balding and a full head shorter than she _ leers up
at her figure and mocks the way she talks.
</P>
<P>
   American accents are funny to Italians. But Italian audiences
also seem to delight in the pairing of tiny balding men with
towering blonde women _ ``Regis and Kathy Lee'' as seen by Fellini.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Beauty and the Beast _ the fantasy that even the monster
can have the beauty,'' explained Gianluca Nicoletti, a radio talk
show host and television critic. ``On Italian television, you never
have handsome men, its short ugly guys and big, beautiful dumb
women.''
</P>
<P>
   But some sociologists also see deeper reasons rooted in the
Italian fascination with American culture _ as well as tiny pangs
of subconscious resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We no longer look to the United States for economic help or
political direction,'' said Franco Ferrarotti, a well-known Italian
sociologist. ``Now we are fixated on America for its youth.
Europeans, and especially Italians, perceive themselves as old. And
we are old _ 60 percent of us are retirement age. We have a new
cultural ideal, which is a youthful, healthy looking American
girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrarotti, whose own wife is American, added, ``She should be
beautiful, blonde, and have an obvious handicap, like she can't
speak the language. That allows us to be patronizing _ this perfect
girl needs our help.''
</P>
<P>
   Offstage, Ms. Windham, 31, a Californian who has lived in Italy
for nine years, speaks fluent Italian and sometimes has difficulty
recalling English (``How do you say in English, `furba?' '' she
asked midsentence. It means clever.) On television, however, she is
not supposed to seem furba.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want me to talk,'' she said. ``One time we had
Australian inventors on the show and instead of letting me
interpret, they used instantaneous translators.'' Ms. Windham shook
her head forlornly. ``That made me mad.''
</P>
<P>
   But she readily admitted that she has a career and celebrity in
Italy that she could never hope to duplicate at home. So did Carol
Alt, 38, a tall, blue-eyed former supermodel who has starred in
several Italian mini-series and now, with the help of dubbing,
plays a heart specialist on ``Under the African Sky,'' a new
Italian television drama _ perhaps an exception to the dumb beauty
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to work at home, for sure,'' Miss Alt said. ``But I
am very happy with what has happened for me here.'' Asked why she
and other Americans were so popular in Italy, Miss Alt replied, ``I
think Italians find foreigners _ how do you say? _ affascinante,
exciting and different.''
</P>
<P>
   That may well explain the sudden popularity of Lisa Molten, a
member of an international chorus of ``soubrettes'' on the game
show ``The Wolf's Mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Audience members select the woman they want to spin the wheel,
and Ms. Molton, 20, is picked so often that each time, the host,
Carlo Conti, ritually sighs, ``Lisa again?'' Ms. Molton, 20, a
ballet dancer from Easthampton, Mass., arrived in Italy only three
months ago and was cast as soon as she opened her mouth and failed
to say anything correctly except ``pasta.''
</P>
<P>
   The balding and bespectacled host enjoys mocking her American
accent, echoing the American-accented, Italian dubbed voice of Stan
Laurel in the old Laurel and Hardy movies, which, known as
``Stanlio e Ollio'' are still popular in Italy. That inside joke is
lost on Miss Molton. ``They are always imitating the way I say
``non capito,''' she said. ``I think it has something to do with
two characters in Italian history.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parisi, 38, a dancer who has performed on Italian TV shows
for 20 years, was discovered in a Roman discotheque. Last month she
riveted her fans when she fainted on ``Caramba, Che Fortune,''
while performing a vampy pas de deux. (She later explained a doctor
had given her a overdose of painkiller for a strained leg muscle.)
</P>
<P>
   Italians love her dancing, but she is just as famous for her
brash blonde American image _ and pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   To some, this is a uniquely Italian phenomenon. ``These shows
reveal a mix of unconscious rascality and also self-mockery,''
explained Giuliano Ferrara, the editor of the Rome daily Il Foglio.
``We really don't take ourselves seriously.'' Ferrara, who is
married to a tall blonde Californian, added, ``it's a playful
fantasy that even men like us can get get a tall, beautiful
American girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Why so many shows cater to male fantasies even though the
audiences for them are predominately female, is a mystery that does
not baffle Daniela Cannizzaro, the cultural critic for Italy's
feminist magazine, Noi Donne. ``Women may dominate viewer
audiences,'' Ms. Cannizzaro said wearily. ``But men still make the
TV shows.''

2ND BUS CRASH IN 4 DAYS ON ATLANTIC CITY ROUTE INJURES 31
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EDISON, N.J. _ A tour bus carrying Chinatown residents home from
Atlantic City careered out of control Sunday morning and slammed
into a tree, injuring all 31 persons aboard, two critically. The
accident came three days after eight people were killed when their
bus to Atlantic City spun off the road five miles from Sunday's
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers said the bus in Sunday's crash appeared to have
been traveling too fast as it rounded a tight curve on an entrance
ramp to the New Jersey Turnpike. It struck a curb, climbed a
concrete embankment, then shot across several lanes of traffic into
a wooded median, the officers said. The bus struck an oak tree so
hard that the tree was uprooted and wedged several feet back into
the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the driver, Gerald Jones, 56, of Brooklyn, was
pinned for nearly an hour &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jones and an unidentified female passenger were flown by
helicopter to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New
Brunswick, where both remained in critical condition Sunday night.
Jones suffered leg fractures and possibly a broken pelvis, said
Lieut. Daniel Cosgrove of the New Jersey State Police. Information
on the woman's injuries was not available. Other victims staggered
around the roadside in a fog of pain and exhaustion, according to
turnpike toll collectors who rushed to the bus from their posts at
the toll plaza at Exit 10, a few hundred yards away. All the
passengers were ethnic Chinese who spoke Cantonese, the authorities
said. They were among a group of a few hundred people aboard nine
buses who had gone to Atlantic City for performances by three
singers from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's accident was the fourth serious one in three years on
the New York-to-Atlantic City route for Academy Bus Tours, of
Hoboken, which has 200 buses in its fleet and makes 23 scheduled
runs each day from Manhattan to Atlantic City. On Nov. 10, a bus
returning to New York veered off the Garden State Parkway into
several trees, injuring 15 passengers. In June 1997, a bus
returning to Chinatown collided with a tractor-trailer in Brooklyn,
injuring the driver and 23 passengers. And in May 1996, a bus on
its way from Chinatown hit a truck on the Garden State Parkway and
slid into a ravine, injuring 18.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Academy Bus Tours declined to discuss the earlier
accidents, but said the company received the highest safety rating
during its most recent audit by the U.S. Department of
Transportation.

PAIN BRINGS STARRING ROLE IN ROSE PARADE FOR STUDENT BAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Musical notes spattered into the cold morning air
above Dodger Stadium as members of the All-District marching band
tried to warm up their lips.
</P>
<P>
   These top student musicians were selected from high schools
throughout Los Angeles for the honor of marching in the Tournament
of Roses Parade. But one day last week, they stood shivering in the
stadium parking lot, while their friends slept. They ran through
tunes for the parade and marched circles around the empty stadium
to build stamina, while their classmates shopped for presents.
</P>
<P>
   Tough work under any circumstances, but well worth it, the
students insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you're seen around the world -- that might scare
some people,'' said drum major Chris Johnson, 18, from Chatsworth
High School in the suburban San Fernando Valley area of Los
Angeles. ``But when you're out there and the band's all behind you,
you don't think about anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Come rain, frost or Santa Ana winds, somehow the band always
pulls together by parade day, organizers and players say.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we don't have lips sticking to mouthpieces or
anything like that,'' said Reggie Smith, one of the band's
directors.
</P>
<P>
   For 26 consecutive years, the best brass and percussion players
from throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District have
marched in the parade as a single band, technically known as the
All-District High School Honors Band but usually called All-City.
For brass, getting there takes a recommendation from a high school
music director. For percussionists, drum majors and flag carriers,
admission to the band comes only through an audition.
</P>
<P>
   Those who make the cut face months of serious work. Saturday
rehearsals in October and November give way to daily practice once
break begins. District buses collect students from across the
sprawling city and deposit them at 9 a.m. on the cold concrete
parking lots. Practice lasts six hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go home, get in bed at 8, wake up and think, not again,''
said Jennifer Johnson, 18, a senior at Chatsworth High School.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pain brings a big payoff: a starring role in a parade
televised across the globe and seen by several hundred million
people.
</P>
<P>
   The parade route runs six miles, so the students march around
the stadium for hours at a time to build up strength. Directors
work their musicians with a mixture of encouragement and abuse,
constantly pushing for a cleaner, sharper sound.
</P>
<P>
   Slacking off won't fly. Catching one trombone player noodling
aimlessly during practice, director Gregory Robinson sent him
running to the far end of the parking lot, perhaps 200 yards away,
with instrument in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a lap!'' Robinson yelled.
</P>
<P>
   The band's five tunes for the parade are taken apart, worked
over measure by measure, then reassembled. If trumpets have
problems with the syncopated swing of ``Jump, Jive and Wail,'' they
don't move on until they can play it clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard an extra note in there,'' Robinson called. ``You're
gonna go to Hades for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The players know the weak spots. Alberto Guardado, 15, a
sophomore at Monroe High School in the San Fernando Valley
community of North Hills, said the group needs to tighten up its
turns and its high-stepping marching technique, a more rigorous
style than most schools use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting there,'' he said, noting in the next breath that
one of his friends is on a cruise to Mexico while he practices.
</P>
<P>
   But the drills pay off. After several hours of play Wednesday,
the musicians warmed up literally and physically, some of them
sweating in the cold. The notes came out cleaner. The band sounded
bigger, tighter, louder.
</P>
<P>
   And for its players, anticipation of parade day, with its
television cameras and immense crowds, was already building.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I work this hard, I'd better be seen,'' Jennifer Johnson
said.

JETS' MARTIN GETS WISH, AND A VICTORY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ If this is what the playoffs are all
about _ running the football, then running it some more _ then
Curtis Martin proclaimed Sunday that he and the Jets were ready.
</P>
<P>
   When Martin signed for $36 million with the Jets in March, he
asked for the ball as often as possible. Coach Bill Parcells
promised to give it to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to run the ball 500 times,'' said the coach. ``And
have Curtis run it 350.''
</P>
<P>
   Since no Jets player had ever done that, it seemed like wishful
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, though, ran 29 times Sunday. That lifted him to 369
carries for the season, and brought the Jets to an even 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very significant,'' Martin said after gaining 102
yards. ``Once you get in the playoffs, everything's speeded up. You
can build on things in the season, but not in the playoffs. You
have to be ready going in.''
</P>
<P>
   For Martin, it was his eighth 100-yard performance of the
season, but it came after gaining fewer yards than that in three
consecutive games. Then, last week, Parcells put everyone back in
pads during workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practiced four days last week,'' left guard Todd Burger
said. ``Normally, we only practice three.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets had an extra day of work because their previous game,
the division-clinching victory over Buffalo, was on a Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 4-12 last year,'' said Burger, who had been dropped by
Chicago. ``Now, I'm 12-4.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin had come from the 10-6 Patriots to the Jets. He knew that
the two games against New England would be important, both to the
Jets and to him personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the schedule came out,'' Martin said, ``I circled the
dates.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Monday night game at New England in October, Martin
returned with a 107-yard rushing effort. Then he looked at the
other circled date _ the regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   Did Sunday's victory have extra meaning?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a lie for me to say no,'' Martin said. ``I really
wanted to win this game. People said, `Is this a relaxed game,
you're already in the playoffs?' Naw, we were coming out full speed
to beat the New England Patriots, and I'm glad we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he reflected on the beginning of the season. ``Everyone was
saying, `Curtis, are you going to take us to the playoffs?' ''
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   He told them, ``I'm only one person, and I can't do
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ``Gratefully, we're in.'' &QL;

   (NYT11) NEW YORK -- Dec. 27, 1998 -- BKN-NBA-LABOR, 12-27 --
David Falk, top, has many star clients, including the union's
president, Patrick Ewing. In what could lead to the cancellation of

THE ROAD FORKS FOR THE GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Ernie Accorsi woke up Sunday morning feeling a
rush of adrenaline and butterflies of possibility. The Giants'
fragile playoff hopes, held in the slippery fingers of the
Cincinnati Bengals, had life. A Bengal victory over Tampa Bay would
keep hope alive. Despite years of pragmatism, Accorsi allowed
himself to dream. Hey, you never know.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I left the hotel parking lot, Tampa Bay had
already scored a touchdown,'' he said. An hour before the Giants'
game started, Tampa was up by three touchdowns. By kickoff, the
Giants' playoff hopes were crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Last season at this time the Giants had just defeated Washington
to clinch the conference championship. ``That was a euphoric
afternoon,'' Accorsi said. ``This could have been an exciting day,
too. Turns out that it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   So Accorsi sat in the Eagles' chilly press box Sunday afternoon,
alternating between a philosophic view of a disappointing season
and the bottom-line pragmatism of a general manager. ``Progress
isn't always a straight line,'' he said. ``Sometimes you make a
right turn. Let's just hope this was a right turn.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the multimillion-dollar question facing a
flagship franchise that in the course of one season celebrated its
1,000th game and the 40th anniversary of a historic National
Football League championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants began the Jim Fassell era at the same time that the
Jets began the Bill Parcells era; the Giants made the playoffs that
first year and the Jets did not. Now the Jets are a Super Bowl
hopeful while the Giants suffered a horrendous free fall, salvaging
a .500 season with a 20-10 victory over woeful Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   So Sunday afternoon, as the Giants' season ended, Accorsi's body
was in Philadelphia but his mind was racing months ahead, to
dispersal pools, minicamps, all-star games, personnel evaluations.
All this to answer the general manager's ever-present, unanswered
question: How do we get better?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, in this business you're always thinking
ahead,'' Accorsi said. He related a conversation he had this summer
with Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, after the Yankees
clinched their division. ``I told him, `I guess you don't have
anything to worry about.' He said, `The general manager's job is to
worry.' He's right: the general manager's job is to worry all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to score points. We need to become more explosive. We
have to re-group, go back to camp and improve ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, the coaching staff will evaluate the season.
The front office and coaches will meet next week; then there will
be an all-encompassing meeting with the scouting staff, coaches and
front office in February. Accorsi will attend the Senior Bowl, then
either the East-West game or a new all-star game in Orlando, Fla.
He will attend the league's combine camp in Indianapolis in late
February.
</P>
<P>
   On the team front, Accorsi has to decide how to contend with the
restricted free agents Conrad Hamilton, Roman Oben and Amani Toomer
and the unrestricted free agents Chad Bratzke, Lance Scott, Gregg
Bishop and Corey Widmer.
</P>
<P>
   Next week Accorsi has to decide which five players to expose for
the dispersal pool for the new Cleveland franchise. ``We have to
make decisions quickly,'' Accorsi said. ``This is a very changeable
league; you can get better or worse a lot faster now. There's no
time to reflect. It's hard to be patient in an impatient
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the Giants' reality: the 1997 Giants who reached the
playoffs or the 1998 Giants who fizzled in the middle and came on
with a push that was too little too late?
</P>
<P>
   ``Given where we were a few weeks ago, when we were 3-7, I think
what we've done is quite an accomplishment,'' Accorsi said.
</P>
<P>
   While executives sit and watch and measure the long haul, the
players play and by definition look at the short term. What goes
through a player's mind on a frosty December day in a game that
held so much promise at the outset, now reduced to futility?
``Sadness,'' said Bratzke, the Giants' right defensive end. ``I
enjoy this game so much. It kind of gets you down. I wanted to keep
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hugh Douglas, the Eagles' defensive end, the feelings are
more conflicted. A year ago Douglas was with the Jets on the eve of
a great season. Now the Jets may be bound for the Super Bowl, and
Douglas, who came to Philadelphia to play for Ray Rhodes, lost a
season and probably a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think `what if,''' Douglas admitted. ``But this is
a business and I am a professional. I'm going to be a
professional.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a day when everyone says farewell; no one is quite sure
where the road leads, only where it has been. ``I thought about how
I could have made one more play here or there,'' Bratzke said. ``I
think of about 100 plays, 99 I did perfectly, I think about the one
play I missed.''

PRACTICE PAYS OFF FOR TWO BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Bruins guard Rico Hines and forward Travis
Reed, the field goals and free throws of December began with
workouts in April.
</P>
<P>
   Each took hundreds of shots per week in the offseason, improving
form, refining muscle memory and bolstering confidence. Little
wonder they're among UCLA's most improved players. They worked
harder than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the most consistent people as far as working out in
the offseason,'' said UCLA assistant Steve Spencer, who coordinated
the shooting programs for Hines and Reed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about getting in the gym and working at game speed.
We gave them the structure and the format (in the spring), and they
did it on their own over the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA gives coaches two hours per week with each player in
the spring and fall, but it prohibits on-court contact over the
summer. Spencer drilled Reed and Hines in April, May and a few
weeks in June. Then they went out and practiced what he preached.
</P>
<P>
   It shows.
</P>
<P>
   _Hines used various drills to improve his 3-point shooting. He
went from spot to spot around the perimeter, sometimes mixing in
sprints, sometimes trying to make as many shots as possible within
a predetermined time. He also refined his form to eliminate excess
motion.
</P>
<P>
   The result: he's improved his 3-point shooting percentage from
30.8 percent last year to 41.2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to snap the ball back or shoot a line drive,'' Spencer
said. ``Now he's giving a good target and using an economy of
motion.''
</P>
<P>
   _Reed concentrated on short hook shots with his left (natural)
and right hand and, especially, on his free-throw shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The result: he's shooting a team-leading 78.6 percent from the
line, a stunning improvement from his 33.3 percent success rate
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travis slowed himself down at the line,'' Spencer said. ``He's
got a routine. Once he locks the ball in, it's one motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the week: Responding to a directive from coach Steve
Lavin during a grueling practice, guard Earl Watson said: ``OK,
coach Knight.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparison shopping: American lost to USC by 15 points two
nights before losing to UCLA by 10. How do the Bruins and Trojans
compare?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' American coach Art Perry said. ``UCLA probably
has more overall talent. (The Bruins) probably have better guards.
Overall, they're probably a little more talented.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have a chance to prove Perry wrong when they host
UCLA on Jan. 20 in the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: Watson and freshman forward JaRon Rush have
taken 50 percent of UCLA's 3-point attempts, but they've made just
28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman big men Dan Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso are shooting
better from the field than from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are outrebounding their opponents by 6.3 per game.
But without the 6-10 Gadzuric (tendinitis), they lost the
rebounding battle against American 41-32.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore guard Baron Davis has 20 assists and 10 turnovers in
his past three games.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what could lead to the cancellation of the
National Basketball Association season, Commissioner David Stern on
Sunday presented what he called the league's final offer to the
executive director of the players union, Billy Hunter, and league
officials said Hunter turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   League officials said that the union's response to Stern's list
of concessions left them with no hope of saving the NBA season
before Jan. 7, the deadline Stern set last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're done; we have gone as far as we can go,'' said Jeffrey
Mishkin, the NBA's chief legal officer. ``There are no more offers.
I expect the season to be canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who met with Stern for five hours in Denver, was not
available for comment on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to make progress toward ending the nearly
six-month old lockout, Hunter, who was on his way to New York from
Oakland, Calif., stopped over to meet with Stern, Deputy
Commissioner Russ Granik and special assistant Bob Lanier in a
session that left both sides still far apart. Hunter was joined by
union president Patrick Ewing and the union's chief legal officer,
Jeffrey Kessler.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an attempt to salvage the season, we made additional
improvements in our offer in the following areas: increases in the
high-end limitations, the rookie salary scale, the percentage of
revenues to be shared with players, and the minimum salary,'' Stern
said in a statement. ``We also proposed an additional exception to
the salary cap and accepted the union's 10 percent limitation on
the escrow arrangement. Unfortunately, this was not enough for the
union. We advised the union that no further offers from the NBA
will be made.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, the union's apparent rejection of the league's offer puts
the NBA that much closer to becoming the first major professional
sport to cancel a season. But with time remaining to make a deal,
Hunter may be planning to present the league's latest offer to the
union's negotiating committee in the next few days and then contact
Stern again during the week.
</P>
<P>
   But one union official said, ``Most of the changes on the part
of the league were purely cosmetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's meeting, Hunter had been willing to swap
concessions and accept the maximum salary offers by the league if
Stern would reciprocate by increasing the minimum salary and offer
an additional salary-cap exception. The concessions offered by
Stern did address the union's major concerns, but the numbers
apparently fell short of the union's desires.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting its new proposal, the NBA moved on several points.
On limiting the salaries of high-end players, the league offered
the following: Players with six years or less years in the league
could earn $8.75 million in the first year of a deal; players with
seven to nine years, $10.5 million, and players with 10 or more
years, $12.25 million. In the past, the union has discussed a $15
million maximum for players with more than six years in the league.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing minimum salaries, the league agreed to offer
minimums of $275,000 to first-year players, $300,000 to second-year
players, $350,000 to third-year players, and then add $50,000
additionally each year, leaving a minimum for a nine-year veteran
of $650,000. In the 10th year, a veteran would receive $1 million
as a minimum. The union has been seeking $375,000 for rookies,
$500,000 in years 2-5, with $100,000 increases after six years and
a $1 million limit.
</P>
<P>
   On one critical issue, the league increased its offer on the
players' share of total revenue to 53 percent in the fourth year of
the deal, 53.5 percent in the fifth year and 54 percent in the
sixth. The union, throughout negotiations, has held firm on getting
56 to 57 percent of basketball-related revenues.

CLASSICAL CDS: CONDUCTOR CHALLENGES EARLY-MUSIC STEREOTYPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most conductors who come from the early-music movement and use
period instruments favor fleeter tempos and lighter textures. At
least that's the general stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian-born conductor Philippe Herreweghe breaks the
stereotype. Though his performances are idiomatic and historically
informed, his musical approach tends to be spacious, unhurried and
coaxing. Yet in his work musical structure emerges with
architectonic clarity. He is the Wilhelm Furtwaengler of the
early-music movement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, having studied piano at the conservatory in Ghent,
Belgium (and also having pursued medicine and psychiatry), he
founded the Collegium Vocale, a choral ensemble to perform music by
Bach and his forerunners. Later he formed the choir La Chapelle
Royale to perform music from before and after the baroque periods,
including contemporary works. His discography on the Harmonia Mundi
label exceeds 40 recordings. Three of his recent releases are
especially rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   Bach: Mass in B Minor
</P>
<P>
   Herreweghe's new recording of Bach's Mass in B minor (HMC
901614.15, two discs) immediately takes a place among the best
currently available. The undulant tempo and pacing in the great
opening ``Kyrie eleison'' chorus are a refreshing break from the
pulsating forward motion that so often characterizes performances
by baroque specialists, performances so driven that you would think
a ballet mistress, rapping a staff on the floor in 4/4 time, had
pushed the conductor aside. With Herreweghe there is just a quality
of natural breathing and inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Christe eleison'' duet for two sopranos, Herreweghe has
encouraged his singers, Johannette Zomer and Veronique Gens, to
bend the phrases with unmannered lyricism, and he obviously doesn't
scowl, like some baroque purists, at a touch of rich vibrato in the
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Without any loss to spirituality, Herreweghe encourages the
instrumentalists to play with bold musical character. For example,
in the bass aria ``Quoniam tu solus sanctus,'' the low-lying parts
for baroque bassoons and horn are rendered with a burly
playfulness, almost like the music of the chiding grandfather in
Prokofiev's ``Peter and the Wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   The soloists are excellent, especially the tenor Christoph
Pregardien. This is a distinguished recording.
</P>
<P>
   Schuetz: `Musikalische Exequien'
</P>
<P>
   Herreweghe has been a strong advocate of the under-appreciated
German master Heinrich Schuetz. Born in 1585, exactly 100 years
before Bach, Schuetz was primarily a composer of sacred music. If
Herreweghe is a ``gentle giant'' among conductors, as he has been
called, the term might equally well be applied to Schuetz's place
among composers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Musikalische Exequien,'' which Herreweghe performs with La
Chapelle Royale (HMD 941261, one disc), is a deeply spiritual yet
humanely direct work, written as a response to horrendous plague,
illness and war. The toll on Schuetz himself had been devastating:
Within a short span of time he lost both parents, his young wife,
his only brother and his two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The work, which, untypical for sacred works of the time, is
written in the composer's vernacular German, calls for a small
complement of soloists, chorus and continuo instruments. The
melancholic, consoling music is consistently subdued in tempo and
dynamics, yet Herreweghe and his forces beautifully capture the
intricacy, delicacy and quiet willpower of the score. A remarkable
recording of a tender masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Brahms: `Ein Deutsches Requiem'
</P>
<P>
   Like the Schuetz work, Brahms' ``Deutsches Requiem'' is a
subdued personal remembrance by a German master. In its pacing,
breadth and conception, Herreweghe's performance (HMC 901608, one
disc) recalls those magisterial recordings by Otto Klemperer and
Herbert von Karajan.
</P>
<P>
   But here, the use of period instruments (L'Orchestre des Champs
Elysees, which Herreweghe founded in 1991), the combined choirs of
La Chapelle Royale and Collegium Vocale and two fine soloists (the
soprano Christiane Oelze and the baritone Gerald Finley), bring a
wonderful transparency to the score.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Brahms' bass lines, often doubled by tuba and
brass, which can sound both muddled and overpowering on modern
instruments, emerge with presence and nuance.
</P>
<P>
   But the main value of this recording is, again, the calming
beauty of Herreweghe's music making. When he conducts the hymnal
``Herr, lehre doch mich'' chorus, he captures the same soft-spoken
expressivity of the Schuetz. You realize that what links these two
distant composers is more striking than what separates them.

NO PLAYOFFS, BUT GIANTS GAIN RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ They had heard the news from Cincinnati,
depression wrapped in a ballooning score as the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers brought an early end to any enchanted dreams the New
York Giants harbored for this day.
</P>
<P>
   Heartsick and dejected, the Giants shuffled through a sleepy
first half against the Philadelphia Eagles and glumly returned to
their locker room beneath the Veterans Stadium grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive Coordinator John Fox assembled the defensive players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all disappointed,'' Fox said. ``Let's at least finish
what we started. Finish it the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether Fox was talking about Sunday's game or the
Giants' 1998 season. But the Giants shut out the Eagles in the
second half to rally and win the season finale, 20-10, and by doing
so closed with a four-game winning streak and an 8-8 record.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, dazed and reeling six weeks ago, sprinted to what
they consider a telling conclusion. It left them one victory short
of a playoff berth, but it allowed the Giants to mix hope with the
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will start next year fresh,'' Giants defensive end
Michael Strahan said. ``Because I think we will learn from this
year's mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Giants were philosophical about this last day of the
season and how it unfolded predictably, if unfavorably, for them.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's 35-0 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals had
eliminated the Giants from playoff contention. Arizona's 16-13
overtime victory over San Diego later in the day sent the Cardinals
into the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants heard the Tampa Bay score in their locker room an
hour before the start of their game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too bad, but you had to be realistic,'' linebacker
Corey Widmer said. ``They didn't lose it for us, we lost it for us
earlier in the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and coaches took a similar approach when discussing
their uneven season, which saw the defending National Football
Conference East champions lose seven of their first 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed that we left this a bit short and I'll
take the blame for that,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said. ``We put
ourselves behind the eight ball early, and I've got to figure out
what changes to make so that doesn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm also proud that we stood up and fought our way out of
it. There is a mental toughness in that and I don't think it will
go away next year. It's like today's game _ we've been playing too
good to end it on a bad note. And we went out and won it in the
second half.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fassel would not elaborate on how he planned to retool his team,
and he wouldn't name Kent Graham his starting quarterback for the
1999 season, even though there aren't many quarterbacks who lose
their jobs sitting on a four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just say this, I've been very happy with the way Kent has
played,'' Fassel said of Graham, who won five of six starts at the
season's end, throwing two touchdown passes to Chris Calloway in
the second half Sunday to defeat the Eagles (3-13). ``Kent's always
had the potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham got an endorsement from one of the leaders on the Giants,
linebacker Jessie Armstead, who credited him with being ``the
navigator on that side of the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Strahan, Armstead added: ``Whoever is quarterback
over there, he's going to have to answer to me and Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstead and Strahan are the Giants' only two Pro Bowl players,
and Armstead said he plans to be especially vocal in trying to
motivate the team next season.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead and Strahan addressed the offensive players during the
team's midseason slump, with some ensuing rancor, but Armstead
seemed to indicate he wouldn't wait that long if things soured next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be hard on people,'' Armstead said. ``We've got
guys in their prime right now and we've got the next four years to
do something with it. I'm not going to worry about stepping on
people's toes any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you aren't doing your job, you've got to answer to me and
Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' 5-1 finish left most in the locker room believing
that the team that concluded the season was the real Giants, not
the one that stumbled out of the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like today's game,'' Strahan said. ``We didn't start
focused, but we finished strong and won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants clearly started the game indifferently because they
were affected by the news of their playoff elimination, something
several players and coaches acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants trailed at the half, 10-6. The high-water mark for
the Eagles came in the second quarter when running back Duce Staley
sliced through a huge hole in the right side of the Giants defense,
dashing 64 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second half, the Giants played with far more
confidence and aggression, taking control of the game with two long
touchdown drives.
</P>
<P>
   Each ended with a touchdown pass from Graham, who completed 15
of 26 passes for 133 yards and no interceptions, to Calloway.
</P>
<P>
   Giants running back Gary Brown, who had 112 yards on 25 carries,
went over 1,000 yards rushing on the first play of the first drive
which closed out the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The running of Brown and fullback Charles Way, who punished the
Eagles defense with 62 important yards in 10 attempts, seemed to
wear down the Eagles late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the Giants' first touchdown drive, Way bulled 20
yards off right tackle, carrying Eagles defenders on his back, and
the Giants were in Philadelphia territory. Graham scrambled for 10
yards and then nearly connected with Calloway for a touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway was open in the right corner of the end zone, but
Graham's pass just glanced off his fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a golden opportunity lost, but on the next play the
unflappable Calloway, whose unspectacular numbers mask his
reliability, caught a tough pass over the middle from Graham for 21
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, on a third-and-4 at the Eagles' 5-yard line,
Graham rolled to his right out of the pocket and fired a pass
intended for Ike Hilliard, who was standing at the right sideline
in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard bobbled the pass as he fell out of bounds, but
Calloway, coming behind Hilliard, caught the deflection and got two
feet in bounds for the touchdown and the Giants' 13-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I dropped one, I really wanted to get a chance at
another one,'' Calloway said. ``I was Johnny on the spot. It wasn't
a hard catch.''
</P>
<P>
   The clinching touchdown followed in the fourth quarter. In the
last sequence of an 11-play drive, Graham lofted an 18-yard
touchdown pass to Calloway in the corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' last attempt to get back in the game ended in the
final minutes when Philadelphia turned the ball over on downs at
the Giants' 7-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not an easy game,'' Fassel said. ``Obviously, we
expected more of the season and had some hopes for today. But in
the end, the team wasn't willing to change course today.
</P>
<P>
   ``And while I'm disappointed, I do feel good about turning
things around. I like the direction we're headed.''

LAST-SECOND FIELD GOAL ENDS CARDINALS' PLAYOFF DROUGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KEN GURNICK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ With another desperate finish Sunday, the Arizona
Cardinals and quarterback Jake Plummer ended the longest playoff
drought in the National Football League, defeating the San Diego
Chargers, 16-13, on a 52-yard field goal by Chris Jacke as time ran
out.
</P>
<P>
   The victory at Sun Devil Stadium locked up the final National
Football Conference wild-card berth for the Cardinals, who will
play next week on the road against the Cowboys, who beat Arizona
twice this year. The victory also touched off a celebration by the
sellout crowd of 71,670, with dozens of fans trying unsuccessfully
to tear down the goal posts through which Jacke's game-winner
sailed.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, then playing in St. Louis, last appeared in the
playoffs in the strike-shortened 1982 season. Only four current
Cardinals had been born when the team made its last post-season
appearance in a complete season, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal franchise has won only one playoff game. It
occurred 51 years ago Monday in the NFL title game against
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very, very thankful for where we are,'' said the
Cardinals' coach, Vince Tobin, whose team blew leads of 10-0 and
13-3. ``Just getting in the playoffs was a goal at the beginning of
the year because it hadn't happened in a long time. For me, it's
only a first step. I'm happy, but not satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacke's third field goal of the game came after Chargers
quarterback Craig Whelihan, who was picked off four times by
Cardinals safety Kwamie Lassiter and whose team trailed virtually
throughout, rallied the Chargers with 16 seconds left on a 30-yard
touchdown pass to Ryan Thelwell. That capped a 68-yard drive that
started with 1 minute 55 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixteen seconds is a lot of time when you have Jake,''
Lassiter said of Plummer, who has nine of these late victories in
two NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Metcalf returned the ensuing kickoff 46 yards. Plummer then
completed a 10-yard pass to Frank Sanders to put the ball on the
San Diego 34-yard line. With three seconds left, Tobin sent in the
field-goal unit.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, Lassiter had offset San Diego's league-leading
defense, which frustrated Plummer and held the Cardinals to one
touchdown, a disputed score by former Jet Adrian Murrell, and a
pair of field goals. San Diego outgained Arizona in total offense,
377 yards to 270, but finished the season at 5-11, losing their
last five.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Cardinals (9-7) their first winning season
since 1984. Because of victories by the Giants and Tampa Bay
earlier in the day, the Cardinals had to win to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get tired of hearing that it's the longest streak without
a playoff game,'' Plummer said. ``I wasn't even alive back then.
This is a new deal, a new team, a new attitude. We want to make an
impact, do something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona struck first in the game _ at least according to Tom
Stabile, the head linesman, who ruled that Murrell scored a 4-yard
touchdown. Television replays showed that Murrell _ despite a
slashing, second-effort run and lunge _ was stopped short of the
goal line by safety Greg Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer completed three passes for 65 yards on the nine-play
drive, the pivotal one a 36-yard flea-flicker in which Plummer
handed off to Murrell, took his lateral and lobbed a completion to
Rob Moore over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, the 24-year-old from Arizona State who became the
second-highest-paid player in the league when he signed a
four-year, $29.7 million contract last week, completed 20 of 41
passes for 274 yards. Whelihan was 16 of 40 for 214 yards, and the
Chargers committed five turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   As he has for the past several weeks, Whelihan started for June
Jones, the Chargers' lame-duck interim coach, over Ryan Leaf, the
$31.25 million rookie who was taken with the second overall pick in
the most recent NFL draft. The Chargers obtained that pick in a
trade with Arizona.

KING NEED ONE GOOD STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Among the Los Angeles Kings' many problems this
season has been a distressing inability to beat the teams they most
need to beat, namely the other four teams in the NHL's Pacific
Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are 0-2 against the Mighty Ducks, 0-1 against San
Jose, 0-1 against Dallas and 0-3 against the Phoenix Coyotes. The
Coyotes defeated the Kings 2-1 on Saturday night and the teams meet
again tonight in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, en route to a 38-33-11 record and their first
playoff berth since 1993, the Kings recorded precisely half their
victories against the Pacific Division, which last season included
Colorado, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver and did not include
Dallas and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were 19-11-2 in 32 games against the Pacific Division
last year, compared to this year's miserable 0-7 start. The Kings
have 17 games remaining against their division this season,
including tonight's game and Wednesday's visit by the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, the Kings (10-21-3) must soon embark on
a lengthy unbeaten streak if they are going to get back into the
race for one of the final Western Conference playoff berths.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to make a move,'' coach Larry Robinson said,
``we're going to have to put a bunch of wins together.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one hot streak can carry a team for an entire season, as
the Kings learned just last year. One timely 13-game stretch in the
82-game season got the Kings into last year's playoffs. From the
start of last season through Jan. 10, the Kings were a mediocre
17-19-8. From Feb. 28 through the end of the season, the Kings were
an equally uninspiring 11-13-1. But from Jan. 12 through Feb. 26,
the Kings were 10-1-2, a stretch that made up for the doldrums of
the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, right around this time, we went on a long streak,''
Robinson said. ``That's what we kind of need right now.''
</P>
<P>
   New assignment: The Kings are expected to assign rookie winger
Josh Green to Springfield of the AHL today. He did not travel with
the Kings to Phoenix. In 26 games, Green has one goal and three
assists. He was a healthy scratch the past three games.
</P>
<P>
   Expectant dad: Winger Dan Bylsma did not accompany the Kings on
the trip, either. Bylsma's wife, Mary Jane, is about to give birth
to the couple's first child.

TROJANS FEEL HORNED HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO _ The teams have barely met, but there's already some
tension between USC and Texas Christian as they head toward
Thursday's encounter in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   During a barbecue Saturday night, the teams' first official
introduction to each other, they started to get on each others'
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a little cocky,'' linebacker David Gibson said.
``Which will be nice. It'll be more fun to play them now.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by quarterback Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a little bit of hostility,'' he said. ``You can tell
it's going to be a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Such predications will be a relief to the Sun Bowl, which has
been taking heat for providing a mismatch on paper between the 8-4
Trojans and 6-5 Horned Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   TCU players, who are thrilled to experience the school's first
bowl game in four years, have been constantly asked if they are
surprised that USC players were not feeling similar joy after
receiving their bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how USC feels about this bowl game, but all I
can tell you is we're happy to be here,'' TCU linebacker Joseph
Phipps said.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said he didn't believe the Trojans were
ever lackadaisical toward the Sun Bowl or TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all a bunch of bunk,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson sprains ankle: Gibson left practice early after spraining
his ankle, but said he thinks he'll still be able to start.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Chad Morton did not practice to rest his sore ankle.
Defensive tackle Aaron Williams (sprained ankle) will probably be
available for only limited duty, Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Soward statement: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward admitted last week
that he is leaning toward turning pro, but doesn't want anyone to
think his mind is made up yet.
</P>
<P>
   He's been put off by speculation recently that he has already
decided to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you guys to write it is not true and my intention is to
come back with the Trojans,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   Doubting Thomas: Although freshman quarterback Jason Thomas
officially did not make the trip because of a sore ankle and
illness, several sources confirmed that he also stayed home because
he had missed at least one practice without permission last week.

NORTHRIDGE'S HEINLE DOES FINE HARRIS IMPRESSION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Inside or outside. Post-up or face-up to the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   That was the scouting report on Cal State Northridge power
forward Rico Harris entering the season.
</P>
<P>
   It's turned into the scouting report on CSUN's 6-foot-9
sophomore, Brian Heinle.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dec. 3 _ when Harris injured his hip, from which he has
yet to return _ Heinle has been remarkable. Not to mention what the
Matadors (7-4) need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to keep it simple and stay within the system, and
if my shots come then I'm going to shoot it,'' said Heinle, who's
averaging a team-best 14.7 points and 6.8 rebounds per game. ``With
Rico out we need to pick up the offensive scoring a little bit, and
I feel I can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past six games, in which CSUN is 4-2, Heinle's averaging
18.3 points. He's scored in double digits each time and was named
the PowerBar Invitational MVP at the University of Hawaii
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle, who averaged 6.9 points last season, scored a
career-high 23 points in the first round of the BYU Classic against
Southern Utah and is shooting 42 percent from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we recruited him, because we knew he could shoot
the ball on the outside,'' coach Bobby Braswell said. ``Besides the
UCLA game (Dec. 19), he's been a force on the inside for us. He's
not afraid to bang in there, which is the thing that hurt him last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he continues to mature and his body gets bigger and
stronger he's going to be a tough kid to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Women face big test: CSUN's women's basketball team will learn
quickly how it compares with the best of the Big Sky. Instead of
easing into conference play, the Matadors (6-4) vault into it
against Northern Arizona on Wednesday (7:05 p.m.) at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks (6-4) are coming off a 22-6 campaign, in which
they went 15-1 in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors were picked to finish third in the conference but
have been plagued by inconsistency since beginning the season 3-0.
However, the return of sophomore forward Neda Milic bolstered the
rebounding game against Oral Roberts last week and should help
balance things.
</P>
<P>
   Football schedule update: Matadors football coach Ron Ponciano
still doesn't want to play Southern Utah in the season opener next
Sept. 4, but a replacement game may not be so easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   Most schools are keeping their schedules open until after next
month's NCAA meetings because conference affiliations could change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, I still think someone out there will give us money to
come play them,'' Ponciano said. ``I'm not worried about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors want to play a Division I-A team, but that creates
another quandary. Southern Methodist is already on CSUN's schedule,
and the thinking in the football offices is the Matadors will have
to go 8-3 or win the Big Sky to make the playoffs. Playing two
Division I-A teams leaves very little margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   A scenario discussed in the past was a game with San Jose State,
if Stanford decides to drop the Spartans from its schedule next
season. It would cost CSUN $10,000 to break the game with Southern
Utah, but a guarantee from the new opponent would cover it.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN wants to break the contract for fear of the players'
safety. The Matadors lost three defensive linemen to leg injuries
in an Oct. 3 win over the Thunderbirds. Each injury occurred on an
illegal chop block.
</P>
<P>
   However, Thunderbirds athletic director Jack Bishop said no one
from CSUN has contacted him about dropping the game in Cedar City,
Utah, since Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was all straightened out,'' Bishop said. ``I know
they are still on our schedule, and as far as I know, we're still
on their schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons update: Former Matadors men's basketball player Jabari
Simmons made the grade at Southern California College and is
eligible for the second semester.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons was CSUN's second leading scorer last season at 12.3
points per game but transferred after disciplinary measures caused
him to miss the final five games of the 1997-98 season. Simmons was
also second on the team with 6.3 rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll make us stronger inside, but if he doesn't buckle down
and play defense he's going to wind up hurting us,'' Southern
California College coach Cameron Dollar said. ``He's got to do
that, which he has to understand.''

PREDICTIONS FOR '99

<P>
   With all the preposterous predictions that can be made about the
world of sports in 1999, at least go to the source: Mystic Meg, the
seer for the supermarket tabloid The Globe.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know her accuracy rating, but based on some of the
actual things she wrote in the Dec. 29 issue, we're not about to
call her the Gary Anderson of Visionaries.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   _Frank Gifford is delighted when he awakens to newspaper
headlines declaring ``ABC Wants Gifford for Monday Night
Football.'' But he's shocked to read that the Gifford they want to
do play-by-play is wife Kathie Lee, not him!
</P>
<P>
   _Road-rage bully Mike Tyson finally meets his match. After a
fender-bender in Beverly Hills, he storms out of his car to tear
the other driver limb from limb. But he relaxes when he realizes he
rammed Zsa Zsa Gabor's new car. Mike sticks out his hand to greet
her, but the Mad Hungarian fractures his skull with her heavy
purse.
</P>
<P>
   _Baseball heroes Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa are cast in a major
motion picture to play two convicts known only by the numbers 70
and 66. While chained together at the ankle, they escape and return
to their tiny hometown to prove their innocence. The movie thriller
is named ``Home Run.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Tonight Show'' legend Johnny Carson faints in the Royal Box
at Wimbledon during a heat wave and is revived by mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation, by lesbian tennis veteran Martina Navratilova, who
was a guest in the next row.
