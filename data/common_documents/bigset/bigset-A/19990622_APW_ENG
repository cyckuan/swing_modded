<HEADLINE> Steel Quota Bill Goes to Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A measure to impose quotas on foreign steel  
shipments came before the Senate today despite heavy lobbying by 
opponents in the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Top administration telephoned senators, urging them to reject  
quotas today. On Monday, Commerce Secretary William Daley told 
reporters there would be grave risks to the U.S. economy if the 
bill becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., argued against the bill, saying  
passage would send a harmful message to the nation's trading 
partners. Furthermore, he said, Congress would be wrong to single 
out an industry for special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trade promotes prosperity,'' Mack said. ``Trade has given us  
far more jobs than would otherwise be available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters lobbied intensively as well. Hundreds of steelworkers  
rallied near the Capitol this morning for a last-minute push in 
support of quotas, which the United Steelworkers of America says 
are necessary to combat low-priced foreign steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was to vote today on restricting debate on the bill,  
the key hurdle for supporters to clear because such a move requires 
a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes. Both sides expected the vote 
to be close. 
</P>
<P>
	The test on quotas followed Senate passage Friday of a bill that  
would create a $1.5 billion loan program for U.S. steel, oil and 
gas producers hurt by fallen prices. The steel industry says the 
loans would only be a first step toward addressing its plight. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry blames the foreign shipments for  
bankruptcies at three U.S. companies and for thousands of layoffs. 
Foreign shipments reached record highs last year in the wake of the 
Asian economic crisis, which reduced demand for steel abroad and 
forced foreign producers to turn to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus,  
said that drastic conditions required drastic measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The quota bill would impose monthly quotas on steel shipments  
equal to the average levels in the three years before July 1997. 
The measure also would set up an import notification system to 
better track shipments into the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said U.S. farmers and businesses that rely heavily on  
exports to other countries might suffer if the domestic steel 
industry obtains quotas on foreign steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The quotas could also hurt U.S. steel companies if an  
international trade war erupts, cutting off U.S. exports from 
foreign markets, Daley said. A fifth of the steel used domestically 
goes into products later sent abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the world's leading exporter, and steel is a  
significant part of those exports,'' Daley said. ``And it is not 
just the steel industry that stands to suffer. Other industries 
that depend greatly on exports and could pay a steep price include 
pharmaceuticals, high-tech, and above all, agriculture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House overwhelmingly passed the quotas bill, 289-141, in  
March, despite the threat of a presidential veto. The total was one 
short of the number needed to override a veto when all 435 members 
are voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said steel quotas would violate international trade  
agreements and make it difficult for the Clinton administration to 
persuade other countries to open their markets to U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daley acknowledged that some senators may ``feel somewhat in  
a box,'' wishing to show their sympathy for workers while 
recognizing that quotas are ``not the right way to go.''

<HEADLINE> Spanish-Language TV Network Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- All Federico Subervi had to do was channel  
surf to make his point. A deadly earthquake had rocked central 
Mexico, and he expected it to be the top story on the evening news 
the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	Not on NBC, whose top was a report on Kosovo. Or CBS, which  
began its broadcast with a '70s fugitive arrested. On ABC, the 
threat of terrorism was the lead story. 
</P>
<P>
	But the disaster dominated Univision, the Spanish-language TV  
network. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a Latino, Mexican or otherwise, you'll go to  
Univision's national newscasts to see what's happened,'' said 
Subervi, a University of Texas media professor. ``Univision 
provides Latino images you do not find on general market 
television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Univision, serving one of the fastest-growing segments of the  
U.S. population, has a business savvy that has made it a Wall 
Street star and the envy of other broadcasters whose audiences have 
shrunk as Univision's has grown. 
</P>
<P>
	Offering a mix of news, talk and entertainment shows produced  
domestically and in Mexico and Venezuela, Univision has become the 
leading Spanish-language television network in the United States 
and the fifth most-watched network overall. It has 92 percent share 
of the Spanish-speaking audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despierta America'' (``Wake Up America,'' which Univision  
describes as ``Today'' with a salsa beat) and telenovelas or serial 
dramas like ``Angela'' may be unknown to most Americans, but they 
draw an audience averaging 4 million viewers a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Univision's primetime viewership in the premium 18-to-49 age  
group swelled by 334,000 during 1998-99, a 25 percent increase, 
according to Nielsen Media Research. The network draws more 
teen-agers per hour than MTV and more primetime male viewers than 
ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontrunner NBC, by comparison, had a 1.4 million loss among key  
primetime viewers, part of the erosion that has accompanied 
multiplying TV choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Univision's target audience is part of the reason the network is  
bucking the trend. The U.S. population is now about 11 percent 
Hispanic, according to U.S. Census figures; by 2050, Hispanics are 
expected to make up a quarter of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Univision has this wonderful tailwind behind them,'' said  
analyst Gordon Hodge of San Francisco-based Thomas Weisel Partners. 
``It's got a potential audience that's growing about 3 percent each 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisers are taking notice. Univision is winning more Fortune  
500 clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who's in any kind of a numbers business, whether it be  
politics or business or finance, has to acknowledge this is 31 
million people, larger than the population of Canada,'' said Henry 
Cisneros, president of parent company Univision Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hispanic Americans have a per capita annual income  
about $10,000 lower than the $39,900 national average, they tend to 
be younger, just entering their peak earning years and willing to 
spend. By 2010, their buying power is expected to more than double 
to $940 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very distinctive audience that Univision captures is gold  
for advertisers,'' said Wall Street analyst John Graves of the 
banking company Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it's a group major networks have pointedly ignored -- even  
though TV executives here are surrounded by signs of Hispanic 
growth. They hear ``marque dos para espanol'' (press two for 
Spanish) when seeking directory information on their cell phones, 
and city buses carry McDonald's ads in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	Few shows have Hispanic cast members, and fewer still have  
explored the Hispanic American experience. According to the Screen 
Actors Guild, Hispanics represented only 3.3 percent of casting in 
TV movies and series in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The departures of Jimmy Smits (``NYPD Blue'') and Benjamin Bratt  
(``Law &AMP; Order'') from their shows makes the coming TV season even 
less diverse. 
</P>
<P>
	That the network can reap the Hispanic viewing windfall is due  
to a combination of dealmaking and executive talent as well as 
programming available through 49 broadcast stations and more than 
900 cable affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	Univision was in trouble in 1992 when entrepreneur A. Jerrold  
Perenchio and partners Televisa of Mexico and Venezuela's 
Venevision bought it from Hallmark in 1992. Perenchio, who has 
headed or owned companies including Loews Theatres and Embassy 
Communications, made sure his new Los Angeles-based Univision 
Communications cut itself a sweet deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Univision gets first pick of all programs to be exported to the  
United States by its partners and can match any bids and reclaim a 
show if it becomes a hit for a competitor. That essentially has 
barred others from doing business with leading producers of 
Spanish-language programming. 
</P>
<P>
	The press-shy Perenchio avoids interviews and generally  
encourages executives to do the same, company insiders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts credit Cisneros with helping to revitalize Univision.  
(The former U.S. housing secretary appears unhampered by legal 
woes: He faces a September trial on charges of lying about payments 
to a former mistress.) 
</P>
<P>
	``His contacts and charisma have been tremendous in getting  
advertisers to recognize Univision,'' said Paribas' Graves. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Univision reported its 10th consecutive quarter of  
growth since its initial 1996 public offering. First-quarter 1999 
revenues were up 31 percent over the prior year, to $138 million, 
and pretax earnings rose 60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Could the network's star eventually be dimmed by traditional  
immigration patterns, in which most assimilated Americans come to 
rely on English alone? Cisneros doesn't think so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have polling that shows that when asked 'Are you proud of  
your heritage?' 95 percent say 'Yes.' And when asked, 'What is the 
primary dimension of your heritage, how do you measure your 
heritage?' they answer 'The Spanish language.'''

<HEADLINE> Paris Insurance Group Sues Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A local branch of France's national health  
insurance program has filed suit against four tobacco companies for 
$8.1 million, blaming them for smoking-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit against Philip Morris, Rothmans, Reynolds and the  
French giant Seita is a first in France, where smoking remains 
widely tolerated and socially acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	Seita called the lawsuit ``groundless,'' saying in a statement  
it plans to claim damages for ``improper procedure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit against the tobacco manufacturers was filed last week  
in a court in the Atlantic coastal city of Saint-Nazaire by the 
regional branch of the Caisse Primaire d'Assurance Maladie. 
</P>
<P>
	The CPAM said it spends $3.7 million yearly on health care for  
smoking-related illnesses, including lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the CPAM's legal department said the agency  
would also ask for $3.8 million in damages per year, as long as 
tobacco products do not offer proper warnings about health risks of 
smoking.

<HEADLINE> Two Treasure Hunters Compete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- For over 90 years, the RMS Republic has  
stood under 250 feet of calm waters off Cape Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	But above ground, a stormy battle has developed over who has the  
rights to salvage the wreck -- and a possible cache of coins that 
could be worth more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A court fight pits William P. Cleary, a personal injury lawyer  
in Hackensack, against Martin Bayerle, who originally discovered 
the ship in 1981 in the international waters off Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men have ventured in the ocean's deep waters to examine the  
wreck. But Cleary says it should be off limits to Bayerle because 
he has not worked on the site for more than a decade, after leading 
a team that explored it for two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayerle insists he is negotiating with the owners of the cargos  
aboard the Republic -- including the Russian government -- to forge 
settlements on dividing the spoils, and then will seek investors 
for a multimillion dollar retrieval project. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleary said he is planning a ``very careful archeological''  
approach, mapping the site by sonar, and then carefully removing 
artifacts. ``We want to recover and restore all the precious 
antiquities,'' Cleary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayerle's response: ``If the gold is not on board, Mr. Cleary  
can go get all the trinkets he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 600-foot Republic, built in England and part of J.P.  
Morgan's White Star Shipping Co., sank after colliding in fog with 
an Italian ship, the Florida, on Jan. 23, 1909, 50 miles south of 
Nantucket Island, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Only six lives were lost, even though the Republic carried 484  
passengers and nearly as many crew on its pleasure cruise to the 
Mediterranean. They transferred to the Florida, which was carrying 
650 immigrants to New York from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayerle has developed the theory that the Republic might have  
been carrying gold coins bought by the Bank of France to help 
Russia's Czar Nicholas II fight the Bolsheviks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayerle, 48, who had run a scuba operation from Martha's  
Vineyard, Mass., says he operates Internet companies in Charleston, 
W.Va., but has continued plans for a major expedition. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, U.S. District Judge John W. Bissell granted  
Cleary's request to ``arrest'' the wreck. In maritime tradition, 
whoever arrests a wreck has the right, with court restrictions, to 
dispose of it. 
</P>
<P>
	In further proceedings Monday, however, the judge refused  
Cleary's bid for an injunction barring Bayerle from conducting 
salvage operations within a mile of the latitude and longitude 
specified by Cleary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayerle said that map location is seven miles from the actual  
resting place of the Republic, and that he has no interest in 
Cleary's site. 
</P>
<P>
	So the judge ruled there is no conflict -- for the moment.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleary promised to return with definitive coordinates after  
further exploration this summer and again try and keep Bayerle 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleary said he would seek investors for a major salvage effort  
next year if he and his team find treasure this year.

<HEADLINE> Russian Files May Shed Light on JFK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Long-sought KGB files on Lee Harvey Oswald  
just handed over to the U.S. government could provide fresh 
information about whether Oswald plotted to shoot President Kennedy 
while he was a defector living in the Soviet Union, historians say. 
</P>
<P>
	The papers, a surprise gift from Boris Yeltsin to President  
Clinton, are a ``monumental breakthrough,'' said Kermit Hall, a 
former member of the Assassination Records Review Board, a 
now-defunct federal panel that tried, but failed, to obtain the 
documents in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The review board, which went out of business last September, was  
created to locate, gather and eventually release to the public all 
known assassination records. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said the Russian records -- declassified papers containing  
information gathered by Soviet intelligence agencies about Oswald -- 
could show what Oswald was thinking and doing in the years leading 
up to the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could tell us if he was scheming to do anything,'' said  
Hall, the incoming provost at North Carolina State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Oswald, a former Marine, defected to the Soviet Union in 1959.  
That attracted the attention of the KGB, which bugged his apartment 
in the Belarus capital city of Minsk, paid neighbors to inform on 
him and kept Oswald and his Russian wife, Marina, under constant 
surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	The KGB amassed a six-volume file on Oswald's activities in  
Minsk, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous news accounts of Russian files on Oswald have said the  
documents showed that the KGB suspected Oswald was an American spy 
when he defected. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, ABC News reviewed Oswald's KGB file with assistance  
from a Soviet translator and a KGB case officer. The network said 
top-ranking KGB officials believed the former Marine was not 
sophisticated enough to carry out the assassination alone. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC wasn't allowed to make copies of Oswald's file and the  
Soviets eventually withdrew their cooperation and refused to allow 
further access to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Disenchanted with his life in Russia and his menial factory job,  
Oswald returned to the United States in 1962, settling in Dallas 
with his wife and baby. Some assassination researchers concluded 
that Oswald did not decide to kill Kennedy until he moved to 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warren Commission, which conducted the official U.S.  
government investigation of Kennedy's slaying, concluded that 
Oswald was the sole gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the assassination, Dallas nightclub owner Jack  
Ruby shot Oswald to death as police transferred him from the city 
jail to the county jail. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, the Interfax news agency said Yeltsin gave Clinton 80  
documents, which also detailed the Soviet government's reaction to 
Kennedy's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the assassination review board members were turned down  
when they sought copies of the files in 1996, writers Norman Mailer 
and Lawrence Schiller were allowed to examine some of them and used 
them for their 1995 book, ``Oswald's Tale.'' The book traces 
Oswald's life but sheds no light on his plot to kill Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said the files are in Russian. Yeltsin gave them  
to Clinton when they met Sunday in Cologne, Germany, for the Group 
of Eight summit. 
</P>
<P>
	It is uncertain what the files contain and whether they are the  
Minsk files on the Oswald surveillance or files from Moscow 
containing the Soviet Union's own investigation of the 
assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to translate them first,'' David Leavy, National  
Security Council spokesman, said Monday from Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said Sunday  
in Cologne that the papers will be reviewed and ``all interesting 
elements will be made public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Archives, which oversees the collection and public  
release of JFK assassination documents, has been in touch with the 
White House about the KGB files, said spokeswoman Susan Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said the files could answer some lingering questions about  
Oswald's activities in Russia, providing fodder for or 
extinguishing theories about whether Oswald had contacts with U.S. 
intelligence officials in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers doubt the Minsk files will contain any  
blockbusters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gus Russo, a lead reporter for a 1993 ``Frontline'' television  
documentary on Oswald, said he has seen some of them and they 
contain ``zero evidence that Oswald was a spy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted ``it will be very anticlimactic.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Group Makes Rules Suggestions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA called on some of its biggest names  
Tuesday to begin repairing a game that many believe has become too 
rough, with not enough scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee of past and present basketball players, coaches and  
front office figures began its review by focusing on four areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Granik, deputy commissioner and chief operating officer of  
the NBA, said that while nothing was finalized, it hoped changes 
could be in place in time for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee wants to take a close look at this and put  
something in writing,'' Granik said. ``We hope to come up with a 
series of moves to be put in place by the Atlanta summer league in 
July. Unless we decide we've made a bad mistake, once we get the 
committee to sign off, they would be recommended to the Board of 
Governors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Thorn, the league's senior vice president for basketball  
operations, outlined the issues identified by the committee: 
</P>
<P>
	-- How a game is officiated from the standpoint of contact,  
grabbing, holding and impeding progress. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Illegal defense guidelines and ways to make them more  
understandable, not only by players, but by fans. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Backing down rules, eliminating the use of forearms around the  
perimeter and contact in the lane. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A 14-second rule, determining when the shot clock will be  
recycled to its full 24 seconds. On violations in the frontcourt 
such as a common foul, with the shot clock under 14 seconds, the 
clock would be recycled to 14, never to 24 seconds. ``The theory is 
once in the frontcourt, a team doesn't need extra time,'' Thorn 
said. ``That would create four or five more possessions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serving on the committee are broadcasters Hubie Brown, Doug  
Collins and Isiah Thomas; owners Jerry Colangelo and Gordon Gund; 
players Antonio Davis, Greg Anthony and Steve Smith; general 
managers Dan Issel, Billy King, Kevin McHale and Donnie Walsh; and 
coaches Mike Krzyzewski, Pat Riley, Rick Pitino and Lenny Wilkens. 
Anthony was a late addition. Missing from the meeting was coach 
Rudy Tomjanovich. 
</P>
<P>
	All except Duke coach Krzyzewski are involved with the NBA.  
</P>
<P>
	The committee was unanimous in not altering the dimensions of  
the court, changing the configuration of the lane, the location of 
the 3-point line or the 24-second clock, Thorn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Granik said the committee's feeling was that changing the way  
rules are enforced would be the best way to clean up the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sentiment was we have to have less contact,'' he said.  
``As the game has evolved, there is too much contact away from the 
ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using videotape, Granik and Thorn showed the committee the  
evolution of officiating through the last three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about what referees see or don't see,'' Granik said.  
``It's about how they call it. Contact that was called a foul 20 
years ago, referees see and learn was not a foul. The view of the 
committee is that kind of contact be called a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the NBA, referees will officiate the way they are  
instructed to, to the best of their abilities.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Weighs Internet Tax Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- States were unable to collect just $170  
million in sales taxes in 1998 because of Internet sales that often 
aren't taxed, says a new study released today at the opening 
session of a federal commission on e-commerce tax policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, by the Ernst &AMP; Young accounting firm, estimated the  
loss at only one-tenth of a percent of total state and local 
government sales tax collections nationwide. Forty-five states 
collect sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study demonstrates that tax revenues for state and local  
governments are being minimally affected be e-commerce,'' said 
Thomas Neubig of Ernst and Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, government officials at the opening session of the  
19-member Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce said the 
explosive growth of Internet commerce could threaten to undermine 
basic services such as education and police protection if it erodes 
existing tax bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to be an impediment to this technology,'' said  
Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk. ``But government has a fundamental role in 
meeting people's basic needs. We need a tax structure that allows 
government to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other commission members, however, said the panel must not ask  
Congress to impose a new national sales tax on e-commerce or impose 
any taxes on such things as Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here as the tax collectors for the current tax  
regime,'' said Stan Sokul, consultant for the Association for 
Interactive Media. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court has ruled that one state cannot force another  
state to collect and remit sales taxes for businesses located in 
its borders. Although most states technically require consumers to 
figure and pay sales taxes on purchased from out of state, it is 
rarely enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today, the commission planned to decide how to solicit  
private money to operate and still avoid any perceptions of a 
pro-business bias. Congress provided no money when it created the 
panel last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want it to look like people are buying access, buying  
influence,'' said commission member David Pottruck, president of 
Charles Schwab Corp. ``It could become a quagmire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel could not resolve the issue Monday after several  
members balked at a proposal by its chairman, Republican Gov. Jim 
Gilmore of Virginia, for each member to contribute up to $150,000 
each -- as Virginia has already done. It is expected to try to reach 
a compromise today on how to finance a projected $1.7 million 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The fear was that contributions from well-heeled companies  
represented on the panel such, as AT&AMP;T, MCI Worldcom and Gateway 
Inc., would outstrip those from state and local governments, 
leading to a perception of bias. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the money comes disproportionately from one side of the  
debate, it my be perceived by some to taint the commission's 
ultimate conclusions,'' said panel member Andrew Pincus, general 
counsel for the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress created the commission to sort out tax issues on  
Internet commerce after lawmakers imposed a three-year moratorium 
on new e-commerce taxes. The panel's report is due in April 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission was delayed for months because organizations  
representing state and local governments filed a federal lawsuit 
claiming the initial appointments were illegally tilted toward 
business. The lawsuit was dropped after Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., replaced Netscape chief James Barksdale with a 
local government official from Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	That conflict and the one over financing demonstrate the  
sensitive nature of the commission's work: How to ensure state and 
local tax collections don't suffer from electronic commerce while 
avoiding a new, heavy tax burden on the companies doing a 
fast-growing business on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal would be to see that whatever solution comes out of  
this strikes the proper balance in a real and credible way,'' said 
Robert Novick, general counsel for U.S. Trade Representative 
Charlene Barshefsky and a commission member. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission today also planned to hear several presentations  
on tax issues surrounding the Internet, both domestic and 
international. It will have at least three other meetings -- one 
each in California's Silicon Valley, New York City and Austin, 
Texas.

<HEADLINE> Turbulence Blamed for Rough Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A United Airlines jetliner ran into last-minute  
turbulence during its approach to the airport and made a hard 
landing, injuring five people. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 266 from San Francisco to Denver had 322 people on board  
Monday when it encountered wind shear on final approach to Denver 
International Airport, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three flight attendants suffering neck and back pains were taken  
to Aurora Medical Center, where they were treated and released. Two 
passengers were taken to Denver Health Medical Center and held 
briefly for observation before they, too, were released. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 36 monitoring devices at the airport registered wind  
shear -- a sudden, dangerous shift in wind speed and direction -- but 
there was a thunderstorm advisory out for the area Monday afternoon 
when the jet landed, airport spokesman Chuck Canon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jetliner went on to Chicago after inspection, United said.

<HEADLINE> Lead Exposure May Speed Tooth Decay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Exposure to lead, which is known to cause mental  
problems and paralysis, may also contribute to cavities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of changes the way we think about tooth decay,'' said  
Dr. Mark Moss, a dentistry professor at the University of Rochester 
School of Medicine and Dentistry and author of a study in 
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding may explain why poor children are more likely to  
have tooth decay -- older, rundown homes often have peeling lead 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we're in the `blame the victim' mode, as if people  
are bad parents if they don't take care of their children's 
teeth,'' Moss said. ``But this shows there may be other factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss and his colleagues studied data from health exams and blood  
tests on 24,901 patients who participated in a government health 
survey. The information was from 1988 to 1994 and focused on 
children 5 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers adjusted statistically for such things as  
income, diet and frequency of dental visits. 
</P>
<P>
	When the children were divided into three groups according to  
their lead exposure -- high, medium and low -- the researchers found 
that nearly 14 percent of tooth decay in children in the 
highest-level group and 10 percent in the medium-level group could 
be attributed to lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jim Crall, who heads the University of Connecticut's  
pediatric dentistry department, called the findings interesting but 
far from definitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I draw from the article is that this is, in fact, one  
more reason to try to minimize lead exposure in children,'' Crall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  
estimate that 57 million private homes in the United States have at 
least some lead paint, and paint chips are a common source of lead 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss said the next step is to understand just how lead might  
promote tooth decay, something his research did not examine. It is 
possible, he said, that lead affects salivary gland development. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1997 study that found that baby rats exposed to lead had  
more tooth decay, the rats had lower production of saliva, which 
helps clean the teeth.

<HEADLINE>  Oh, Baby! U.S. Open Was Thrilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just think if Payne Stewart had missed.  
</P>
<P>
	His 15-foot par putt on the 72nd hole provided the most  
thrilling finish in the history of the U.S. Open. Since it was 
first played in 1895, no one had ever won with a putt that long on 
the last hole of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	But think of the drama that awaited had Stewart missed that putt  
and gone to an 18-hole playoff the next day with Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a good chance Stewart might have been playing alone.  
</P>
<P>
	No one will ever know if Amy Mickelson really would have dialed  
her husband's pager number and punched in the secret code that 
signaled she was going into labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was convinced Mickelson would have hurried off  
Pinehurst No. 2, even though he had a private plane and a co-pilot 
on standby all week. But even Mickelson doubted the baby would 
arrive nine days early. 
</P>
<P>
	Amanda Brynn Mickelson was born at 6:11 p.m. PDT Monday in  
Arizona, 20 1/2 inches long and weighing 7 pounds, 4 ounces. Mother 
and daughter are both healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The father was there for the whole thing, and says he would have  
been regardless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not have been playing,'' Mickelson said Tuesday. ``I  
would definitely have come home, no question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But would he have known to come home?  
</P>
<P>
	Amy has been with him for most of his 13 victories on the PGA  
Tour, the most of any active player who has yet to win a major 
championship. She knows what a major would mean to Mickelson. She 
shared the disappointment of Shinnecock Hills in the '95 Open and 
Valhalla in the '96 PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Would she really have paged him?  
</P>
<P>
	``I will answer that for her in simple terms,'' Mickelson said.  
``She had better have told me, no matter when or what time. This is 
where we are, and that's what would have happened. We had a deal 
before the U.S. Open as to what would happen, and I was going to be 
there with her no matter what.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of that came to pass.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart won the U.S. Open with indubitable determination, making  
clutch putts on the last three holes to bury the memory of his 
failure the previous year at Olympic Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson was the runner-up by one stroke after missing two  
8-foot putts on the 16th and 17th holes and a 25-foot putt on the 
last. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods tied for third. He missed a 5-foot par putt on the  
17th and a 25-foot birdie putt on the last hole, believing that any 
one of those putts might have gotten him into a playoff. That's one 
reason he was glad to see Stewart make his par putt on No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been tough sleeping for the next few nights,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	How tough would that have been for Mickelson?  
</P>
<P>
	As the week went on, Amy kept getting good reports from the  
doctor, and the prospect of Mickelson leaving early became less of 
a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
	But just suppose there had been an 18-hole playoff.  
</P>
<P>
	Amy's water broke shortly before noon EDT, about the time  
Mickelson would have been shaking Stewart's hand on the first tee 
and wishing him luck. She went into labor a little after 3 p.m. 
They would have been somewhere around the par-3 15th. Maybe 
Mickelson would have had a two-stroke lead. 
</P>
<P>
	BEEP!   	
</P>
<P>
	Stay or go?  
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson had been presented with every hypothetical situation  
during the week. What if he were leading on Sunday? What if he were 
on the back nine? 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm out of here,'' he always said.  
</P>
<P>
	The record books would have shown Mickelson with a WD. Stewart  
would have had to play the round by himself so he could post a 
score. The bigger story would have been Mickelson's devotion to his 
wife and daughter over a moment that could have defined his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after Stewart had won, Mickelson heard one last scenario.  
</P>
<P>
	It's one thing to walk off Pinehurst in the middle of the final  
round, when the Open was still up for grabs among Stewart, 
Mickelson, Woods and Vijay Singh. It's quite another to leave 
during a playoff and let the other player win by default. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' Mickelson replied, ``but come middle of June next  
year, we're going to have another Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson didn't get to hold the U.S. Open championship cup  
Sunday. One day later, he was holding something far more precious. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, that made one of the greatest U.S. Opens even better.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jets Bomb Iraqi Defense Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. fighter jets bombed a military  
command center in northern Iraq Tuesday after Iraqi forces fired on 
the planes in the northern no-fly zone, the U.S. military said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force F-15s and F-16s attacked the military command and  
control center northwest of Mosul, a city 250 miles north of 
Baghdad, the U.S. European Command said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi army, in a statement carried by the official Iraqi  
News Agency, claimed the planes attacked ``civilian 
installations.'' Iraq reported no casualties or damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack came after the warplanes, which are enforcing the  
no-fly zone north of the 36th parallel, were fired on by 
anti-aircraft artillery, the European Command said. 
</P>
<P>
	All U.S. planes returned safely to Incirlik air base in southern  
Turkey. The damage to the Iraqi sites was being assessed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi army, in a statement carried by the official Iraqi  
News Agency, claimed the planes attacked ``civilian installations'' 
close to the northern city of Mosul. The army reported no 
casualties or damage. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second attack on an Iraqi command and control site  
reported by the U.S. military this week. On Monday, U.S. jets 
attacked another installation north of Mosul after being fired on 
by anti-aircraft artillery. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British warplanes have been enforcing the no-fly zone  
in northern Iraq since the end of the 1991 Gulf War to protect 
Iraqi Kurds against Baghdad's forces. Another no-fly zone was set 
up in southern Iraq to protect Shiite minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq does not recognize the zones and has challenged allied  
planes there since December.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Forget about King of the Jungle -- ``Tarzan''  
is king of the box office. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first weekend, the animated Disney picture raked in $34.2  
million, seizing the No. 1 spot in North American theaters. Coming 
in second was the previous box-office champ, ``Austin Powers: The 
Spy Who Shagged Me.'' It garnered $31.4 million in its second week. 
</P>
<P>
	Another film that debuted this weekend, ``The General's  
Daughter,'' starring John Travolta, came in third with $22.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace'' remained strong,  
losing just 31 percent of its business in the fifth week, to bring 
its total to $328 million for sixth on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next few weeks, it is expected to easily pass No. 5  
``Forrest Gump'' ($330 million) and No. 4 ``Jurassic Park'' ($357 
million) as it seeks to challenge the original ``Star Wars'' ($461 
million) for second all-time behind ``Titanic'' ($600 million).

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall, whose pending divorce  
could prove ugly, kissed Monday night after a celebrity-studded 
movie premiere. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving separately at a party after the showing of ``Rogue  
Trader,'' Ms. Hall gave Jagger a kiss on the cheek and the couple 
exchanged a few words while smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	They separated earlier this year after newspapers reported  
claims by Brazilian model Luciana Giminez Morad that she was 
carrying Jagger's child. Jagger maintains he and Ms. Hall were 
never legally married.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Gains in European Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOULOUSE, France (AP) -- Turkey, Slovenia and the Czech Republic  
produced more upsets at the European Championship Tuesday, while 
Lithuania stayed alive by defeating Germany 84-74 behind 20 points 
from Arvydas Sabonis. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Dejan Bodiroga had 19 points, six rebounds and five  
assists as defending champion Yugoslavia cruised to a 83-68 victory 
over Macedonia to bring its record to 2-0 and drop Macedonia to 0-2 
in Group A. 
</P>
<P>
	Tariq Abdul-Wahad, a Sacramento Kings forward, had a big second  
half to lead France past Israel 77-66 and improve the host team's 
record to 2-0. Israel is 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia nearly became another victim of the series of upsets, but  
pulled off a 73-72 victory over Hungary, which is making its first 
appearance at the championship in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Igor Koudeline had 21 points as Russia brought its record to 2-0  
in Group B in Clermont-Ferrand. Hungary is 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same group, Slovenia beat Spain 85-75 behind 27 points by  
Matjaz Smodis. Both teams are now 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey trailed by seven points at halftime against Croatia in  
Group C in Antibes. But 18 points and eight rebounds from Hidayet 
Turkoglu helped the Turks come back and win 70-63. They also got 15 
points from Mirsad Turkcan and 10 points and 13 rebounds from 
Huseyin Besok. 
</P>
<P>
	Veljko Mrsic had 18 points and Toni Kukoc, a three-time NBA  
champion with the Chicago Bulls, added 17, but no one else in the 
young Croatian team shot in double figures. Turkey is 2-0, while 
Croatia fell to 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Antibes, Italy beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 64-59, leaving  
both with 1-1 records. 
</P>
<P>
	Lithuania, upset by the Czech Republic on Monday, got 24 points  
from Saulius Stombergas, 19 of them in the second half. Sabonis, 
the Portland Trail Blazers' center who was severely criticized by 
his coach for a pale performance against the Czechs, had 20 points 
and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Dirk Nowitzki, a Dallas Mavericks forward, again led Germany  
with 16 points. Both teams are now 1-1 in Group D in Dijon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czechs followed with an 83-72 upset of Greece to go 2-0.  
Greece is 0-2. Lubos Barton, a forward who plays for Valparaiso 
University in the United States, had 26 points and eight rebounds 
for the Czechs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-team preliminary round is played in four French cities,  
with three teams from each group advancing to the second round. All 
teams with 2-0 records are already sure of going through. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Wahad led France with 19 points and led a decisive  
two-minute span as France overturned a two-point deficit into a 
62-51 lead with less than nine minutes left. He began with a 
three-point play, a layup, then had a steal, sank a 3-point shot, 
had another steal and finished the extraordinary series with an 
assist. He also led France with eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlade Divac, the Sacramento Kings center, sank a 3-pointer to  
give Yugoslavia a 41-31 lead midway into the first halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Divac, who shot 100 percent from the field for eight points in  
the first half, made a layup to give his team a 51-40 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Vrbica Stefanov kept Macedonia in the game with 16 points  
in the first half. He was held to seven in the second half, but 
still led all scorers with 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Divac finished with 11 points, and Dejan Tomasevic added 12.  
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia, which is also the world champion, used 10 men, with  
playmaker Sasha Obradovic resting a groin injury. Predrag 
Stojakovic, a Sacramento Kings guard, still has not joined the team 
because of a knee injury.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks Bring Up Pitcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks purchased the contract  
of right-handed pitcher Dan Carlson from Triple-A Tucson on Tuesday 
to shore up a bullpen depleted by excessive use in recent games. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Carlson, the Diamondbacks optioned infielder  
Edwin Diaz to Tucson. Diaz will have to begin a five-game Pacific 
Coast League suspension starting Tuesday night for using a tampered 
bat. The penalty was issued just as Diaz was brought up from Tucson 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	He told reporters that he used an ice pick on the bat to harden  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson was 2-5 with a 4.52 earned run average in 16 outings  
with Tucson, 11 of them as a starter. Carlson appeared in 10 games 
last season with Tampa Bay. He is 1-0 lifetime in the major 
leagues, the victory coming with the San Francisco Giants in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz earned his first major league hit in his only at-bat during  
his 10-day stint with the Diamondbacks. It was a double in the 
ninth inning against Atlanta on Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Court Aids Discrimination Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today made it slightly  
easier for victims of on-the-job discrimination to force their 
employers to pay extra monetary damages as punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Job-bias victims can collect such damages without showing their  
employer's conduct was ``egregious,'' the court ruled by a 7-2 vote 
in the case of a woman denied a promotion because of her sex. 
</P>
<P>
	But by a separate 5-4 vote in the same case, the justices said  
employers cannot be forced to pay the extra damages for managers' 
discriminatory conduct if that conduct is contrary to the 
employers' good-faith efforts to run a bias-free workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was the availability of so-called punitive damages,  
those intended to punish or deter misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court had ruled that such awards are never  
available unless an employee can prove the employer's conduct was 
``egregious.'' That standard is too high and is not required by a 
federal anti-bias law known as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, the nation's highest court said today.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Highway Suit Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Three environmental groups have settled a suit  
against state and federal transportation officials, agreeing to 
allow 17 of 61 contested road projects to continue while federal 
funds for the rest are halted. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed in January, claimed the authorization of the  
road projects -- worth $700 million -- were illegal under federal 
environmental rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sends a message across the country that communities have  
to make transportation investments that clean up the air and curb 
sprawl development,'' said Southern Environmental Legal Center 
attorney William Want, who represented the Sierra Club, the Georgia 
Conservancy and Georgians for Transportation Alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was reached late Friday in last-minute negotiations  
spurred by the possibility of others joining and thus complicating 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing had been set for Monday to hear arguments from several  
counties and the Georgia Roadbuilders Association, which wanted to 
join the case on the side of the defendants -- the state and federal 
Departments of Transportation and the Atlanta Regional Commission, 
responsible for transportation planning in the 13-county Atlanta 
metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
	The projects allowed to go forward, worth about $125 million,  
are those already under construction. The rest will do without 80 
percent federal funding until they can show they will help reduce 
Atlanta's ozone levels, which have been out of compliance with 
federal standards since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The projects were authorized after the area fell out of  
compliance with air quality standards set in the federal Clean Air 
Act. Officials argued that, since construction and planning began 
before the city fell out of compliance, they should be allowed to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Washington, D.C., federal appeals court ruled in another  
lawsuit that such ``grandfathering'' was illegal, and federal 
transportation officials soon changed their guidelines to prohibit 
the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement allows the state to continue negotiating  
purchases of rights of way where a written offer has already been 
tendered -- about 400 offers involving 20 projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has another 40 days' worth of federal funding for  
designing road projects. Frank Danchetz, chief engineer for the 
state Transportation department, said it has not been determined 
whether state funds will be used to continue designing the 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Before any project begins construction, it must be included in a  
regional transportation plan approved by the Atlanta Regional 
Commission and the new Georgia Regional Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	That plan must show it will reduce ozone before any more federal  
funds are allocated.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Act Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With nine days left in the life of the  
Independent Counsel act, the chairman of the committee considering 
its renewal said Monday that Congress should give the Watergate-era 
law ``a decent burial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Fred Thompson  
said the law is fatally flawed because it provides loopholes that 
allow an attorney general to protect a president under suspicion, 
while leaving independent counsels defenseless against unfair 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who supports leaving the probes with the Justice  
Department with provisions for congressional and White House input, 
said he was heavily influenced during hearings earlier this year 
when staunch political enemies - the Clinton administration and the 
prosecutor who investigated it, Kenneth Starr - agreed that 
Congress should allow the law to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you had Mr. Starr and (Attorney General Janet) Reno both  
coming down on the same side, that's pretty powerful medicine,'' 
Thompson, R-Tenn., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile a small group of senators who believe independent  
counsels are the only way to instill credibility with the public 
about such investigations plan to introduce a bill this month to 
rescue it, according to a spokeswoman for Sen. Susan Collins, 
R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	The future of the 1978 law, which expires every five years  
unless Congress renews it, became hotly debated after Starr's 
perjury and obstruction probe of President Clinton culminated in 
his impeachment and acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan commission headed by former Senate Republican  
Leader Howard Baker recommended in December that the Congress wait 
until the passions of that historic fight cool before deciding 
whether to let the law die. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who had long puzzled over whether there was any way to  
fix the law without violating the Constitution, didn't even wait 
for the statute to expire. 
</P>
<P>
	He told reporters Monday that he will introduce legislation that  
would place investigations of high-ranking government officials 
under the Justice Department, and require the attorney general to 
come up with rules that would govern the scope of independent 
prosecutors she might appoint for such probes. Congress and the 
White House would have to sign off on those rules, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The safeguard against abuses and conflicts of interest, Thompson  
said, would be Congress' oversight responsibility, news coverage 
and elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to require more out of all of us,'' Thompson said.  
``We've kind of used the Independent Counsel statute as a crutch.''

	Clinton Pledges Aid to Balkans  
</P>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- President Clinton thanked Macedonians  
today for supporting NATO forces and sheltering Kosovo refugees and 
pledged millions of dollars to help build a better future in the 
Balkans. ``NATO could not have achieved its mission without you,'' 
he said in addressing the Macedonian parliament. Clinton will also 
visit a refugee camp where he's expected to urge the ethnic 
Albanians to help rebuild their war-torn homeland, and not seek 
revenge against the Serbs. Macedonia, an impoverished state of some 
2 million residents, housed up to 140,000 refugees.

	Kosovo Blast Caused by NATO Bomb  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The blast that killed two  
peacekeeping soldiers and two civilians as the troops cleared 
explosives from a schoolhouse came not from a Serb booby trap but 
from a NATO cluster bomb that accidentally went off, the British 
military said today. The deaths yesterday of two Nepalese soldiers 
attached to the British army were the first allied fatalities since 
NATO peacekeepers entered Kosovo on June 12. The soldiers were 
moving the bombs into piles to be detonated and ``it was during the 
wiring of the charges that two piles detonated prematurely with 
tragic results,'' British officials said.

	U.S. Jets Bomb Iraqi Defense Sites

	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. fighter planes bombed a military  
command center in northern Iraq today after being fired on by Iraqi 
forces in the northern no-fly zone, the U.S. military said. The Air 
Force F-16s and F-15s attacked a military command and control 
center northwest of Mosul, a city 250 miles north of Baghdad. The 
attack came after the warplanes were fired on by anti-aircraft 
artillery, the European Command said. U.S. and British warplanes 
have been enforcing the no-fly zone in northern Iraq since the end 
of the 1991 Gulf War to protect Iraqi Kurds against the forces of 
Baghdad.

	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A member of the Irish

anti-terrorist prison today as part of the republic's peace deal. 
Patrick Magee received eight life sentences for his role in the 
1984 bombing of the Conservative Party annual conference in 
southern England, an attack that killed four people but narrowly 
missed Thatcher, but became the 277th paramilitary prisoner to be 
freed early as part of the 1998 Good Friday peace accord. The

The wristwatch-like device, called GlucoWatch, automatically checks

Sanchez-Vicario struggled with her forehand and turned the match 
around when she started coming to the net. Two matches that were

casual players,'' the 36-year-old Russian grandmaster told an 
audience at Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	The interactive chess tournament is called ``Kasparov vs. the  
World.'' The chess champ struck a deal with Microsoft Corp. to play 
the match at http://www.msn.com. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	In front of the audience of young chess fans and the media, the  
Russian grandmaster simulated his online opening move, king pawn to 
e4, on a giant board. The Web site immediately began fielding 
countermoves from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Before each move is actually played, chess enthusiasts will vote  
via computer to decide what move the ``World Team'' will make. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to the site have 24 hours to vote for their side's  
move. Kasparov will then reply within another 24 hours, and so on, 
until the conclusion of the match, expected to take most of the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where else but on the Internet can you play the world  
champion?'' Kasparov asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is being guided by five young chess experts who  
are suggesting their own possible moves and tactics against 
Kasparov. After each move, the Web site will air live ``chats'' on 
coaches' strategies and options. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposing team experts are among the world's finest young  
chess players. They include Irina Krush, the 15-year-old U.S. 
women's chess champion; Etienne Bacrot, 16, who became the youngest 
grandmaster in history at age 14; Florin Felecan, 19, who is the 
highest-rated American chess player under age 21; and Elisabeth 
Pahtz, 14, who is ranked eighth in the World Championship of 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is a marriage of an ancient game and a high-tech  
world -- a pairing not foreign to Kasparov, billed as the greatest 
chess player ever. 
</P>
<P>
	In the highly publicized 1997 ``Deep Blue'' tournament, he was  
defeated by the IBM supercomputer -- a ``man vs. machine'' victory 
that left him smarting. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Monday his current, cutting-edge encounter ``is a more  
pleasant event for the human race.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 94.35 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Tuesday, halting a run at  
new highs in the Nasdaq market, as investors remained antsy about 
interest rates and company profits for the nearly finished quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 94.35 to 10,721.63 after a  
rebound attempt failed during afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also posted steep losses.  
</P>
<P>
	The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index came within 10  
points of its April 26 closing record of 2,652.05, but finished the 
day 50.02 lower at 2,580.26. The loss ended a five-session winning 
streak that boosted the index by 232 points, or nearly 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors are growing hesitant before the  
impending rush of company reports on the second quarter, which 
concludes at the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very choppy ahead of the earnings season,'' said Tony  
Dwyer, chief equity strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; Co. But, he 
added, since there haven't been that many major warnings from 
companies, ``earnings should be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, with no new economic data released Tuesday to steer  
the market, investors also focused on next week's meeting on 
inflation and interest rates at the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	While most people have accepted that the Fed will likely nudge  
lending rates higher to slow the economy, this week's increase in 
bond-market interest rates has proved unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow slid 39 points on Monday as the yield on the 30-year  
Treasury bond, a key influence on interest rates, bobbed back over 
6 percent. In Tuesday's trading, the yield edged higher again, 
reaching 6.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates tend to unnerve the stock market because  
they lower corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy industrial companies that are particularly sensitive to  
the pace of economic activity led the Dow's decline Tuesday. DuPont 
fell 2 7/16 to 67 3/4, International Paper fell 1 7/8 to 52 5/8, and 
AlliedSignal fell 1 9/16 to 66 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Among leading technology names, IBM fell 1 3/8 to 123 3/8 after  
jumping 4 points on Monday as the Dow's strongest component. In 
Nasdaq trading, Cisco Systems fell 2 1/8 to 59 1/2 and Microsoft fell 2 
7/16 to 86 1/2 after posting big gains on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Tuesday, declining issues outnumbered advancers  
by a 9-to-7 ratio on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,299 up, 
1,690 down and 564 unchanged. Nasdaq decliners led by a 7-to-5 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE composite volume totaled 878.96 million shares, only  
slightly better than Monday's 841.78 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 13.12 to 1,335.88, the NYSE  
composite index fell 3.83 to 633.11, and the American Stock 
Exchange composite index fell 0.28 to 765.47. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.11 to 447.33.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.22 percent.  
Germany's DAX index was unchanged, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.43 
percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.16 percent.

<HEADLINE> Panel Approves Summers Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawrence Summers won a unanimous  
recommendation from members of the Senate Finance Committee on 
Tuesday to succeed Robert Rubin as Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Summers got a warning that although approval  
of his confirmation by the full Senate is expected to come easily -- 
probably before the end of next week -- his subsequent dealings with 
Congress could be more contentious. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't guarantee that there won't be storm clouds down the  
road,'' said Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., at a hearing of the Senate 
Banking Committee that Summers attended even as the Finance 
Committee was voting its approval of his confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators on the banking panel, including Sarbanes, offered their  
overall support for Summers, noting his reputation as an academic 
economist and experience as Rubin's deputy since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is very well-suited to hand the baton to,'' said Sen. Rick  
Santorum, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Many senators, however, raised concerns about Clinton  
administration policies that Summers has helped institute. 
Contentious issues include U.S. participation in bailouts of 
economically troubled countries, including Russia, and opposition 
to quotas on steel imports and to a Republican proposal to repeal 
estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers received similar cautions, along with the expressions of  
support, offered by senators when he testified before the Finance 
Committee Thursday. Before the committee's vote Tuesday, he 
submitted written answers to some final questions raised at that 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other concerns, Summers' addressed worries raised by Sen.  
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., about puzzling inflation figures 
released by the government for the last two months. In April, the 
Consumer Price Index jumped by 0.7 percent, the most in nine years. 
But in May, prices were flat. 
</P>
<P>
	In his written response, Summers said he believes ``both results  
were statistical extremes,'' and noted that most economists predict 
inflation will remain relatively tame for the rest of this year -- 
although prices are expected rise a bit more rapidly than last 
year's very low 1.5 percent inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers has given no sign that he intends to deviate from the  
economic policies laid down by his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The right course has been set and our challenge will be to  
carry on,'' Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, a former Wall Street financier, announced plans last  
month to leave the Treasury Department and return to private life. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is expected to vote on Summers' nomination before  
adjourning next week for an Independence Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
	The Banking Committee has no special authority over Summers'  
confirmation, but shares oversight of many issues with the Treasury 
Department, including bank regulation and the design and production 
of U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said he generally supports legislation, passed by the  
Senate last month and expected to be considered soon in the House, 
that would remove obstacles now barring banking companies from 
offering other financial services such as insurance and 
investments.

<HEADLINE> Princess Cruises To Double Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The parent of the global cruise line Princess  
Cruises is spending $2 billion on five new ships in a campaign to 
keep pace with rivals and cash in on the fast-growing demand for 
vacations at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the new ships will go to Los Angeles-based Princess  
Cruises, the largest subsidiary of Peninsular and Oriental Steam 
Navigation Co., the London-based cruise, ferry and port services 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The five ships, combined with four others already on order, will  
double the passenger capacity of Princess, which accounts for about 
75 percent of Peninsular's cruise business. The cost of all nine 
ships is $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The move follows major expansion announcements by Peninsular's  
chief competitors including the world's largest cruise line, 
Carnival Corp., and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all expanding because of the success that we've  
experienced,'' said Peter Ratcliffe, president of Princess Cruises. 
``The business is very profitable. That's why we want to continue 
with our success and we believe we can double in size over the next 
five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide, the cruise industry generated about $12 billion in  
revenue during 1998, with $9 billion coming from the U.S. market. 
The industry is expected to grow by about 10 percent a year through 
2001, said Joe Hovorka, a leisure analyst with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time they bring on a new ship it gets filled just by the  
excitement of having a new ship. The cruise industry is still 
relatively young, it's still in its growth period,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth is being driven in large measure by the U.S. economic  
expansion that has helped put cruise vacations within the reach of 
thousands of middle-class Americans. Also, the vacations themselves 
have become cheaper, starting as low as $100 per day per passenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Cruises' key demographic target, baby boomers earning  
$55,000 a year or more, also is growing and will double by 2010, 
Ratcliffe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor is the increased popularity of cruise vacations  
among Europeans and Asians. As steamship companies bring on newer, 
bigger ships for the U.S. market, they typically send smaller ships 
to Europe or Asia to develop those markets, Hovorka said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asians were receptive until the region's economic recession cut  
personal income, and Europe slowed this year because of the Kosovo 
crisis. Both are considered strong growth markets in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cruising has just really started to become a blip on the radar  
screen in Europe,'' said Linda Bannister, an analyst with Edward 
Jones. ``That's not even talking about the potential in Asia down 
the road. This is an industry that has a lot of opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Plans Factory in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is planning to invest $300 million  
in a car-manufacturing plant in Russia that is slated to start 
production in two years, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, which will have a production capacity of 50,000 cars  
a year, will be built on a site now used by a Russian engine maker 
in the city of Vsevolozhsk near St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Deputy Economics Minister Sergei Mitin said Ford would  
also help Russia set up a high-tech assembly line for making car 
parts to be sold separately, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and Ford President  
Jacques Nasser agreed in a meeting Monday to sign a final pact on 
the deal this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Before signing the investment agreement, Ford and Moscow will  
have to decide how many domestically-produced components will be 
used in the production process. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford cars have been sold in Russia since the early 1990s, and  
Stepashin said ``we found out that it is indeed a good and reliable 
car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Soviet Union, all imports were controlled by the  
government, and regular citizens could rarely get their hands on -- 
or afford -- western cars. But foreign vehicles have been a common 
sight on Russian roads since the Soviet collapse in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant will produce the cars, rather than assemble vehicles  
from components shipped from aboard, Russian officials said.

<HEADLINE> Panel Hears Youth Violence Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTAGE, Mich. (AP) -- Calling high school ``the hardest time,''  
a teen-ager told a congressional panel that school violence won't 
stop until society better protects children from cruelty -- at home 
and at school. 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Burgess, 16, sobbed Monday as she described the  
name-calling and social pressures of her own freshman year that she 
said made her feel suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one is subjected to constant agony at school ... more at  
home, it's only a matter of time before they snap,'' she said. 
``High school is the hardest time of your life. Without family or 
friends to lean on, it is the survival of the fittest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burgess was one of eight west Michigan residents to testify  
before members of the Early Childhood, Youth and Families 
subcommittee. The group is looking into steps to end the sort of 
school violence that rocked Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	That Littleton, Colo., massacre, in which two students killed 12  
classmates, a teacher and themselves, followed other fatal 
school-related shootings in recent years in Pearl, Miss., West 
Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., Edinboro, Pa., and Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Reps. Fred Upton, Michael Castle and Dale Kildee, all of  
Michigan, spent more than two hours listening to ideas about how to 
address the issue of youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no single answer,'' Upton said after the hearing. But  
he said it was ``important to... get out of Washington'' to seek 
opinions on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A consensus was elusive among those who testified on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Phillip McElhenny, a Christian school superintendent, told the  
panel that Bible-based education is needed to restore traditional 
values. 
</P>
<P>
	Darnell Jackson, director of the Michigan's Office of Drug  
Control Policy, praised a state law requiring the mandatory 
suspension of students who bring weapons to school. 
</P>
<P>
	But Susan Caulfield, a Western Michigan University professor,  
said such policies do nothing to identify or cure the causes of 
youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``To exclude, expel or suspend them won't prevent violence,''  
she said. ``Look at our own crime rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But most panelists were optimistic that youth violence can be  
managed if schools and communities work together to ensure young 
people feel valued. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is different than it was 20 years ago, let alone 30,  
40 or 50,'' said Jay Newman, superintendent of the St. Joseph 
County Intermediate School District. ``Our only hope is communities 
will pull it together.''

<HEADLINE> Gazprom Secures Money for Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's gas monopoly, Gazprom, expects to  
announce it has secured funding for a $2 billion Turkey-bound 
pipeline next month, a senior executive said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Russia's financial crisis last fall, raising money for  
Russian capital investment has become very difficult, even for 
Gazprom, the world's largest natural gas producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gazprom Vice President Pyotr Rodionov said the  
company was close to securing a loan earmarked for the pipeline 
project from a consortium of Western banks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Gazprom board member Yuri Garyainov said the company  
would announce the funding next month, although he declined to name 
the banks involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, we are working on finalizing the technical issues and  
closing contracts with contractors,'' Garyainov said. 
</P>
<P>
	The construction of the sea stretch of the  
565-billion-cubic-foot pipeline is due to begin early next year, 
Garyainov said. Earlier, Gazprom had said the work was scheduled to 
start in the third quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Building in Turkey has already begun, Garyainov said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 750-mile pipeline will contain a 250-mile stretch on the  
Black Sea bed, making it one of the most ambitious pipeline 
projects ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The ownership and cost of the pipeline will be split between  
Gazprom and the Italian state oil and gas company ENI. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of the Turkey-bound pipeline project and Gazprom's  
other mammoth project, the 7,500-mile Yamal-Europe project, the 
Russian company intends to increase its exports by around 20 
percent by 2010, Garyainov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports are vital for Gazprom, given that the company collects  
payment for only about one-fifth of its domestic gas deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	A complex network of pipelines already under construction,  
Yamal-Europe is planned to connect gas fields in northern Russia to 
consumers in Central and Western Europe.

<HEADLINE> Steel Quota Bill Goes to Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A measure to impose quotas on foreign steel  
shipments came before the Senate today despite heavy lobbying by 
opponents in the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Top administration telephoned senators, urging them to reject  
quotas today. On Monday, Commerce Secretary William Daley told 
reporters there would be grave risks to the U.S. economy if the 
bill becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., argued against the bill, saying  
passage would send a harmful message to the nation's trading 
partners. Furthermore, he said, Congress would be wrong to single 
out an industry for special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trade promotes prosperity,'' Mack said. ``Trade has given us  
far more jobs than would otherwise be available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters lobbied intensively as well. Hundreds of steelworkers  
rallied near the Capitol this morning for a last-minute push in 
support of quotas, which the United Steelworkers of America says 
are necessary to combat low-priced foreign steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was to vote today on restricting debate on the bill,  
the key hurdle for supporters to clear because such a move requires 
a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes. Both sides expected the vote 
to be close. 
</P>
<P>
	The test on quotas followed Senate passage Friday of a bill that  
would create a $1.5 billion loan program for U.S. steel, oil and 
gas producers hurt by fallen prices. The steel industry says the 
loans would only be a first step toward addressing its plight. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry blames the foreign shipments for  
bankruptcies at three U.S. companies and for thousands of layoffs. 
Foreign shipments reached record highs last year in the wake of the 
Asian economic crisis, which reduced demand for steel abroad and 
forced foreign producers to turn to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus,  
said that drastic conditions required drastic measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The quota bill would impose monthly quotas on steel shipments  
equal to the average levels in the three years before July 1997. 
The measure also would set up an import notification system to 
better track shipments into the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said U.S. farmers and businesses that rely heavily on  
exports to other countries might suffer if the domestic steel 
industry obtains quotas on foreign steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The quotas could also hurt U.S. steel companies if an  
international trade war erupts, cutting off U.S. exports from 
foreign markets, Daley said. A fifth of the steel used domestically 
goes into products later sent abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the world's leading exporter, and steel is a  
significant part of those exports,'' Daley said. ``And it is not 
just the steel industry that stands to suffer. Other industries 
that depend greatly on exports and could pay a steep price include 
pharmaceuticals, high-tech, and above all, agriculture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House overwhelmingly passed the quotas bill, 289-141, in  
March, despite the threat of a presidential veto. The total was one 
short of the number needed to override a veto when all 435 members 
are voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said steel quotas would violate international trade  
agreements and make it difficult for the Clinton administration to 
persuade other countries to open their markets to U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daley acknowledged that some senators may ``feel somewhat in  
a box,'' wishing to show their sympathy for workers while 
recognizing that quotas are ``not the right way to go.''

<HEADLINE> Gwynn Scratched Due to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- San Diego outfielder Tony Gwynn, who needs 18  
hits to reach 3,000 for his career, was scratched from the lineup 
before Tuesday night's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn sat out with tightness in his left calf, the same nagging  
injury that forced him out in the sixth inning of Saturday's game 
against Pittsburgh. He also sat out Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn's status is day-to-day, the Padres said.  
</P>
<P>
	His only full game since coming off the disabled list June 12  
was last Thursday against Philadelphia. Gwynn went 2-for-5 for his 
first multi-hit effort since May 4 at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres began a three-game series in Los Angeles on Tuesday  
night. They will play 16 consecutive days leading up to the 
All-Star break that starts July 12.

<HEADLINE> Oswald Files Called a Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Long-sought KGB files on Lee Harvey Oswald  
just handed over to the U.S. government could provide fresh 
information about whether Oswald plotted to shoot President Kennedy 
while he was a defector living in the Soviet Union, historians say. 
</P>
<P>
	The papers, a surprise gift from Boris Yeltsin to President  
Clinton, are a ``monumental breakthrough,'' said Kermit Hall, a 
former member of the Assassination Records Review Board, a 
now-defunct federal panel that tried, but failed, to obtain the 
documents in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The review board, which went out of business last September, was  
created to locate, gather and eventually release to the public all 
known assassination records. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said the Russian records -- declassified papers containing  
information gathered by Soviet intelligence agencies about Oswald -- 
could show what Oswald was thinking and doing in the years leading 
up to the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could tell us if he was scheming to do anything,'' said  
Hall, an Ohio State University historian. 
</P>
<P>
	Oswald, a former Marine, defected to the Soviet Union in 1959.  
That attracted the attention of the KGB, which bugged his apartment 
in the Belarus capital city of Minsk, paid neighbors to inform on 
him and kept Oswald and his Russian wife, Marina, under constant 
surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	The KGB amassed a six-volume file on Oswald's activities in  
Minsk, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Disenchanted with his life in Russia and his menial factory job,  
Oswald returned to the United States in 1962, settling in Dallas 
with his wife and baby. Some assassination researchers concluded 
that Oswald did not decide to kill Kennedy until he moved to 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warren Commission, which conducted the official U.S.  
government investigation of Kennedy's slaying, concluded that 
Oswald was the sole gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the assassination, Dallas nightclub owner Jack  
Ruby shot Oswald to death as police transferred him from the city 
jail to the county jail. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, the Interfax news agency said Yeltsin gave Clinton 80  
documents, which also detailed the Soviet government's reaction to 
Kennedy's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the assassination review board members were turned down  
when they sought copies of the files in 1996, writers Norman Mailer 
and Lawrence Schiller were allowed to examine some of them and used 
them for their 1995 book, ``Oswald's Tale.'' The book traces 
Oswald's life but sheds no light on his plot to kill Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said the files are in Russian. Yeltsin gave them  
to Clinton when they met Sunday in Cologne, Germany, for the Group 
of Eight summit. 
</P>
<P>
	It is uncertain what the files contain and whether they are the  
Minsk files on the Oswald surveillance or files from Moscow 
containing the Soviet Union's own investigation of the 
assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to translate them first,'' David Leavy, National  
Security Council spokesman, said Monday from Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said Sunday  
in Cologne that the papers will be reviewed and ``all interesting 
elements will be made public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Archives, which oversees the collection and public  
release of JFK assassination documents, has been in touch with the 
White House about the KGB files, said spokeswoman Susan Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said the files could answer some lingering questions about  
Oswald's activities in Russia, providing fodder for or 
extinguishing theories about whether Oswald had contacts with U.S. 
intelligence officials in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers doubt the Minsk files will contain any  
blockbusters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gus Russo, a lead reporter for a 1993 ``Frontline'' television  
documentary on Oswald, said he has seen some of them and they 
contain ``zero evidence that Oswald was a spy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted ``it will be very anticlimactic.''

<HEADLINE> Regulator OKs Societe Generale Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French bank Societe Generale's new bid for  
investment bank Paribas, launched in response to a takeover attempt 
by Banque Nationale de Paris, was declared acceptable Tuesday by a 
key market regulator. 
</P>
<P>
	The clearance by the Conseil des Marches Financiers comes a day  
after the Bank of France asked the three banks involved in the 
protracted takeover battle to meet to resolve their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bidding battle is far from over. The Bank of France and  
the stock market watchdog Commission des Operations de Bourse must 
also rule on Societe Generale's new offer. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are few signs that Societe Generale and Paribas are  
willing to sit down and negotiate with BNP. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble started when BNP made an unsolicited $37 billion bid  
for both Societe Generale and Paribas March 10, a month after the 
two banks had themselves announced a friendly merger to create SG 
Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks have been fighting the bid. Last week, Societe  
Generale sweetened its offer for Paribas shares in a move to fend 
off BNP. 
</P>
<P>
	The closing date for Societe Generale's bid for Paribas will be  
set after it has been approved by a regulatory body within the Bank 
of France, the Conseil des Marches Financiers said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of France said it would delay its recommendation on  
Societe Generale's bid for Paribas until it receives more 
information on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Should BNP succeed in its takeover, it would create the world's  
first $1 trillion bank in terms of assets.

<HEADLINE> Larkin Leads in NL All-Star Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cincinnati's Barry Larkin widened his lead over  
the New York Mets' Rey Ordonez to nearly 8,000 votes in the closest 
race in NL balloting for next month's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, a nine-time All-Star, is No. 1 among shortstops at  
309,563, followed by Ordonez at 301,678. Larkin led by just 2,296 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs leads all NL players, topping  
outfielders at 942,738 in totals announced Tuesday. He's followed 
by San Diego's Tony Gwynn (483,919) and Colorado's Larry Walker 
(478,470). 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Piazza of the New York Mets, an All-Star the past six  
seasons and the game's MVP in 1994, leads catchers at 647,304. 
Piazza began Tuesday with a career-high 23-game hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals (642,143) has a huge  
lead at first, Houston's Craig Biggio (466,572) has a big lead at 
second and Arizona's Matt Williams (357,035) is ahead by a 
comfortable margin over Atlanta's Chipper Jones (281,265) at third. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game is scheduled for July 13 at Boston's Fenway  
Park and balloting runs through Sunday. NL starters will be 
announced July 6, a day after AL starters.

<HEADLINE>  Sabres Are Hailed by 20,000 Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Sabres coach Lindy Ruff had two words for  
the 20,000 fans crammed in front of City Hall Tuesday and the 
dozens of others watching from rooftops and hanging from windows of 
downtown office buildings: ``No goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That sent fans into a pom-pom waving frenzy and set off a chant  
of ``No Goal! No Goal!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans were there to thank the Sabres for an exciting season,  
but they were clearly not happy with the way it ended: A 
controversial goal in triple overtime of Game 6 that sent the 
Stanley Cup to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Some carried signs saying ``We were cheated, not defeated,'' and  
``Thou shalt not steal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One more game! One more game!'' they shouted at the rally's  
start. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff said he was amazed ``to have this many people show up for a  
party that should have been three days later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had the Sabres won Game 6, the seventh and deciding game of the  
finals would have been played Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, goalie Dominik Hasek and the rest of the team pulled  
their jerseys over shorts and T-shirts and looked ahead to next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's get cup crazy 2000,'' Hasek told the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither Sabres owner John Rigas nor general manager Darcy Regier  
specifically mentioned Brett Hull's Stanley Cup-winning goal, 
scored with his skate in the crease. NHL officials said they let 
the goal stand because Hull maintained possession of the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the disappointment we all had in the last game,'' Rigas  
said. ``My honest belief is next year, they're going to take one 
step further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres smiled as the crowd, assembled in 80-degree sunshine,  
broke out in chants and deafening cheers throughout the hour-long 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though they were defeated, we still have to show them  
support,'' said Jennifer Feher of Kenmore. ``They represented 
Buffalo throughout the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While she remained disappointed over how the series ended, she  
said the fans would eventually put it behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Buffalo, we're tough people. We'll come back next year,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But 14-year-old Jayson Zwawa of Buffalo said forgetting would be  
tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're never going to get over it,'' he said. ''They were  
robbed.''

<HEADLINE> Richardson Fights Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson conceded on  
Tuesday that ``more needs to be done'' to protect U.S. nuclear 
secrets, and Republican senators pushed anew to overhaul security 
at the nation's weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing with Richardson on Capitol Hill, the head of an  
intelligence advisory group that issued a critical report on 
nuclear security said that unclassified computer systems at weapons 
labs continue to be accessible from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether nuclear secrecy was assured, Warren Rudman,  
chairman of the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, 
said, ``I don't think it's safe now. I don't think the secretary 
does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudman and Richardson spoke at a House Commerce Committee  
hearing. At a joint hearing of four Senate committees earlier in 
the day, they sparred over restructuring the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said that a ``firewall'' had been established to  
prevent people from accessing computer systems at the weapons labs 
except for the labs' widely accessible web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't take any confidence in that statement,'' said Rudman.  
``These firewalls are penetrated all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson conceded: ``The firewalls have been set up. Are they  
perfect? No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he emphasized that this applies to unclassified computer  
systems used by scientists at the labs. A separate classified 
computer network contains the top-secret weapons data and 
additional measures have been taken in recent months to safeguard 
against transfers between the two systems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, investigators at the Los Alamos weapons lab near  
Santa Fe, N.M. discovered that a scientist, who had been under 
suspicion of possible espionage, had transfers thousands of files 
of top-secret material from the classified system to his personal 
office computer in the mid 1990s. It has never been determined 
whether any of that information left the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, momentum was growing in the Senate for a radical  
restructuring of the Energy Department that would insulate its 
nuclear weapons programs under a largely autonomous agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said the nuclear weapons program  
``needs to be rescued'' from the vast bureaucracy of the Energy 
Department to ensure nuclear secrets are safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson disagreed and said it would be a mistake to create  
``a bureaucratic Berlin wall'' that would weaken future energy 
secretaries and -- in his view -- reduce security instead of 
strengthening it. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said a proposal to  
create a nuclear security agency within the department likely would 
be offered on the Senate floor this week. Some Democrats predicted 
privately that it had a good chance of passing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects in the House are less certain.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the Commerce Committee,  
and Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, the panel's ranking Democrat, 
expressed concern that such an agency would weaken attempts to 
ensure health and safety and other oversight of the weapons labs 
and the department's other weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a concern Richardson also raised repeatedly in testimony  
before both the Senate and House panels. ``Fencing off the weapons 
complex I don't believe is the answer,'' Richardson argued. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he accepted 90 percent of the Rudman panel's  
recommendations and would support some reshuffling of nuclear 
programs under a new undersecretary of energy, giving the program 
increased importance. ``More needs to be done,'' he said. But 
Richardson said that creating a new, powerful nuclear agency within 
the department was abhorrent to him. 
</P>
<P>
	But supporters of an Energy Department overhaul pointed to the  
Rudman panel's key recommendation after its 90-day review of 
nuclear weapons security -- a review ordered by President Clinton. 
It called for creation of a semiautonomous agency to control 
weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudman said the Energy Department ``is badly broken'' and warned  
against taking ``half measures'' that the bureaucracy could ignore 
under a less-aggressive energy secretary. An insulated agency for 
weapons programs is essential, Rudman insisted. ``We don't think 
anything else will work,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some restructuring appeared to be increasingly inevitable as  
both Republicans and Democrats in Congress searched for answers to 
concern about the loss of nuclear secrets because of 20 years of 
inadequate attention to security and counterespionage at the 
weapons labs.

<HEADLINE> Air Conditioner Efficiency Weighed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q. I'm shopping for an air conditioner, and I noticed the ones  
that have higher ratings for energy efficiency are also more 
expensive. Is it worth paying the extra money? 

</P>
<P>
	A. In general, yes. And since a lot of utilities still make  
electricity with fossil fuel, you also will have the satisfaction 
of knowing that you're helping the environment by consuming less 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
	To find out how efficient an air conditioner is, look for an  
energy efficiency rating, or EER. The higher the number, the 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a survey in the June issue of Consumer Reports  
magazine, even small differences in EER ratings can have a 
significant impact on your summer electric bill. 
</P>
<P>
	An air conditioner with a rating of 10, for example, would  
consume 20 percent less energy than one with a rating of 8. Say 
your summer electric bills usually increase by about $50 a month 
for air conditioning, then the more efficient air conditioner could 
save you $10 per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Add up how much you would save over the summer months, and you  
may find that you save enough over a year or two to offset the 
extra cost of the more efficient air conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't always mean it will make sense to throw out a  
less-efficient air conditioner in favor of buying a new one, says 
Jim Nanni, who tests air conditioners and other home appliances for 
Consumer Reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, if you're buying a new one anyway, it usually pays to get  
one that's energy efficient and suitable to your needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more you pay for electricity, the greater benefits you  
will reap from having a more efficient air conditioner,'' he says. 
``The more that your air conditioner runs, the more likely it is 
that an efficient air conditioner will save you money.''

<HEADLINE> USGA Motto: Beat the Clock  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The stop watch is replacing the lawn mower as the one piece of  
equipment responsible for the most complaints about the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	It's one thing when the fairways are cut too close (Olympic  
Club) or the rough is not cut enough (Oakland Hills, 
Congressional). Presented with the toughest conditions in golf, 
some players believe they should be given more time to cope with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these shots that you face on this course are not  
40-second shots,'' Brandel Chamblee said. ``They're 
minute-and-a-half shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in two years, the final pairing was put on  
the clock in a U.S. Open. Payne Stewart managed to deal with it 
better this time. For Phil Mickelson, it was old news. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been put on the clock every day,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The short-game shots that had to be played at Pinehurst No. 2  
were unlike anything players will see all year, requiring anything 
from a mid-iron to a putter, even a fairway metal being used as a 
putter. Hit it too firm, and it rolls through the green. Hit it too 
short, it rolls back the slope to the same spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I disagree being on the clock when you're in the last few  
groups of a major championship,'' said Tiger Woods, who also felt 
the presence of the almighty stopwatch. ``With the greens as severe 
as they are ... it takes time to figure out the slopes. I 
understand the pace of play rule, but there are exceptions to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any by looking at these greens, I think that's a pretty good  
exception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods winced at the thought of a one-stroke penalty for a bad  
time in a championship that has been decided by that margin the 
past four years. 
</P>
<P>
	It brings to mind what Ben Hogan told a USGA official who was  
timing him one year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to penalize me, tell me now so I know where I  
stand,'' Hogan said. ``I'm not playing any faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PINEHURST REVISITED:* It took 92 years to bring a U.S. Open to  
Pinehurst No. 2. The wait for the next Open won't take nearly as 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd have to be out of our minds not to be seriously  
considering another Open on Pinehurst No. 2,'' USGA executive 
director David Fay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the British Open, the USGA doesn't have a rotation for  
its premier championship. Still, it goes back to the most storied 
venues once every decade or so -- Pebble Beach, Shinnecock Hills, 
Olympic Club and Oakland Hills, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pinehurst seems to be in that top tier,'' Fay said. ``Of the  
venues that I've seen in 21 years, there's no question Pinehurst 
No. 2 deserves to be in that top shelf of U.S. Open sites.''

</P>
<P>
	For the 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, the 502-yard second hole  
will be reduced and played as a par-4, a USGA official said on 
condition of anonymity. The three previous Opens at Pebble Beach 
all played as a par-72.

	No. 2 will be shortened to about 485 yards. Even at 502 yards,  
some of the longer hitters could reach it in two with a long iron -- 
and that in February for the AT&AMP;T Invitational, when conditions 
were wet and the roll on the fairway was minimal.

	Changes to Pinehurst No. 2 resulted the longest par-4 in U.S.

<HEADLINE> NFL Leaders Oppose Stadium Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proposed legislation that would require  
professional sports teams to set aside 10 percent of TV revenues 
for new stadiums was panned Tuesday by NFL representatives, who 
said it would hurt small market teams and lead to labor strife. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, proposed by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., would  
require Major League Baseball and the National Football League to 
put 10 percent of TV revenues into a construction trust fund that 
would pay up to 50 percent of the costs of building and renovating 
stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said the bill was needed to stop what he called the  
``legalized extortion'' of teams threatening to relocate if local 
communities don't pay for new stadiums. Under the bill, leagues 
that don't set up the trust fund could lose their exemptions from 
antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, NFL  
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the bill was ``unnecessary and 
would have negative, unintended effects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it would increase revenue disparities between small and  
large market teams, ignore local decision-making and threaten the 
league's collective bargaining agreement with the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Upshaw, an executive director of the National Football  
League Players Association and a former star player for the Oakland 
Raiders, agreed that Specter's bill could create serious problems 
by affecting hundreds of millions of dollars in TV revenues that go 
into determining NFL player salary caps. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was an ``unprecedented intrusion by Congress'' into  
collective bargaining and antitrust agreements between the players 
and NFL management. 
</P>
<P>
	But Specter argued that if the league wants antitrust  
protections, it should pay for its own stadiums. He said this was a 
major issue in Pennsylvania, where taxpayers are paying for 
two-thirds of the $1 billion cost of four new sports stadiums 
around the state. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Cincinnati, he said, the public is paying $190 million of  
the cost of a $240 million stadium, while in Baltimore, they're 
paying $200 million of $224 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue replied that there has been a steady growth in private  
investment in NFL stadiums and that in the past 10 years the league 
and its teams have contributed more than $1.5 billion to 
construction and renovation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said walling off 10 percent of TV revenues would be  
particularly hard on small-market teams that rely heavily on that 
source of income. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Richardson, owner and founder of the Carolina Panthers,  
told the panel that the team's hometown, Charlotte, N.C., is the 
28th largest television market in the country, ``and it is of great 
significance to us that the Panthers share television revenues 
equally with teams located in far larger communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, the NFL's stadium committee chairman, said it was  
also not accurate that voters give the NFL a blank check to build 
stadiums. He noted that voters in Arizona and Pittsburgh had 
recently rejected new stadium financing proposals, and that 
Minneapolis voters had turned down a proposal for a new Minnesota 
Twins baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., said he supported the goals of the  
Specter measure but is ``particularly concerned with how it would 
impact small media market teams, like the Green Bay Packers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holding up a jarful of dirt from the Packers' Lambeau Field,  
Feingold said TV revenues were crucial to the Packers' ability to 
stay in Green Bay, and that the financing of stadiums should be 
resolved at the state and local level, not by federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, S. 952, would also enlarge the antitrust  
exemption given to professional sports leagues to permit them to 
deny a member club's request to move its franchise to a different 
city.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Apologizes to Belgians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Two weeks after children first got sick  
after drinking Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft-drink company 
apologized today and admitted it reacted slowly to the health 
crisis that has sapped consumer confidence and stock market 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	In France, meanwhile, the government said all tests on canned  
Coca-Cola products have turned up negative, suggesting the French 
Agency for Food Safety could lift the ban on Coke sales soon. 
</P>
<P>
	French officials, however, revealed for the first time that they  
were looking into the case of a woman who lost her unborn child in 
the seventh month of pregnancy after drinking a Coca-Cola product. 
</P>
<P>
	Health Minister Bernard Kouchner said that case was referred to  
judicial authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	About 800 cases were brought to the attention of experts in  
France, and of those, nine ``were very precisely studied by 
toxicology specialists,'' Kochner said. None could be clearly 
linked to a problem with Coca-Cola products, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union is seeking further investigation into what  
caused more than 200 cases of stomach pains, nausea and 
hyperventilation linked to drinking Coca-Cola products. Some 
children had to stay two nights in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	As selective bans on Coca-Cola products in Belgium, France and  
other European countries entered their second week, Coke's chairman 
sought to win back consumers' favor with an apology published in 
full-page ads in Belgium's major papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have spoken with you earlier,'' M. Douglas Ivester  
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, health and safety issues always come before business  
issues,'' he said. ``I want to say that I am personally very sorry 
for any discomfort or inconvenience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, Coca-Cola stock bounced back from an extended a  
retreat. Coke was up $1.43 3/4 at $63 a share, a gain of 2.3 percent 
in morning trading today on the New York Stock Exchange. Coca-Cola 
had fallen 3 percent in heavy trading on Monday on top of a 1.6 
percent slide last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester remained in Brussels today with the company's marketing  
chief, Charles Frenette, for meetings with Belgian government 
officials in an attempt to speed up the resumption of sales of 
Coke, Sprite and Fanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium banned all Coca-Cola products on June 14, and only  
restored some of its brands to store shelves Thursday. France has 
banned sale of cans produced at a plant in Dunkirk. The Netherlands 
and Switzerland also have imposed selective bans. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-nation EU's Executive Commission has said Belgium and  
France would conduct inspections on Coca-Cola plants over the next 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Coca-Cola has blamed defective carbon dioxide,  
used to put fizz in its drinks, for problems at its Antwerp 
manufacturing plant in Belgium. The company also said the outside 
of cans made in Dunkirk became contaminated with a wood 
preservative during shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the two unrelated problems led to nausea and  
vomiting. But one company-commissioned study suggested the health 
problems were psychosomatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgian officials were skeptical of that explanation.  
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty children had to be hospitalized. Eight had to spend the  
night in hospital. Four had to spend two nights in hospital. It 
makes me doubt any argument about psychosomatic,'' said Health 
Ministry spokesman Marc Pattyn.

<HEADLINE> Stottlemyre Throws After Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Todd Stottlemyre threw a baseball Tuesday for the  
first time since he partially tore the rotator cuff in his shoulder 
five weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Diamondbacks right-hander played catch for about 10  
minutes and said he felt fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little stiff at first, but I expected that when you  
don't pick up a ball for five weeks,'' he said. ``But my last three 
or four minutes I thought went real good. At this point, it's a 
natural progression of how I feel. I'll just try to throw a little 
bit longer, a little bit further and a little bit harder each day, 
I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Paul Lessard estimated that Stottlemyre could be ready  
to pitch in a big-league game in four weeks, but Stottlemyre is 
avoiding talking about any timetable. He wants to be back in the 
rotation sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally, I think timetables restrain you,'' he said. ``At  
this point, I don't want any more restraints than I already have. 
If I get ready before that, then I'll know things went real well. 
If I don't, that's not the end of the world anyway. It puts me out 
on the mound sometime in July.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre decided against undergoing season-ending surgery and  
instead decided to work on strengthening his shoulder and getting 
back to work this season. He said he's gained about eight pounds of 
muscle while working out with weights and has never been stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is hopefully it will get some scar tissue over the  
top of it and that sort of thing to help protect it,'' Stottlemyre 
said. ``But the main thing is just to try to strengthen all around 
it and throughout the whole body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre signed a four-year, $32 million contract with  
Arizona and was the No. 2 pitcher in the Diamondbacks rotation 
behind Randy Johnson. Stottlemyre was 4-1 with a 4.29 earned run 
average when he was injured while pitching against the Giants in 
San Francisco on May 17. 
</P>
<P>
	An intensely competitive person, he has had a tough time only  
watching as the Diamondbacks took the lead in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	He was excited to finally be able to pick up a baseball and  
throw it, even if it was only a light game of catch from 60 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was real light, but I'm at ground zero,'' he said. ``I've  
had to build a lot of strength, and at this point I've got to start 
at the ground floor and move up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no doubt the Diamondbacks can use Stottlemyre. Brian  
Anderson has started in Stottlemyre's absence to decidedly mixed 
results. Anderson, who had no decision in Arizona's 7-4 10-inning 
loss to Cincinnati on Monday night, is 1-1 with a 7.84 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Sparks Trade Wideman To Cleveland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Sparks traded point  
guard Jamila Wideman, who is on injured reserve, to the Cleveland 
Rockers on Monday for seldom-used guard Jen Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sparks then waived Howard to remain at the WNBA's 11-player  
roster limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Wideman was the Sparks' first-round choice in the inaugural WNBA  
draft in 1997, the third overall selection, after helping lead 
Stanford to three consecutive NCAA Final Four appearances from 
1995-97. 
</P>
<P>
	She started the Sparks' first 14 games, then was used as a  
backup to Penny Toler for the remainder of the 1997 season and all 
of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	After averaging 2.5 points and 3.0 assists and shooting 24.8  
percent over two seasons, Wideman's future with the Sparks became 
tenuous after they drafted Ukari Figgs, the NCAA Final Four's MVP 
from Purdue, and signed standout Yugoslavian point guard Gordana 
Grubin this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs won the starting point guard position from Toler in  
training camp. Wideman sprained her right knee during an early June 
practice and was placed on the injured reserve list June 9. She has 
not played in a regular-season game in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Wideman, 23, will serve as a backup to 32-year old Suzie  
McConnell Serio with the Rockers, the WNBA's lone winless team at 
0-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, 24, played 15 minutes in four games for Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> Widow Sues for Defamation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A woman who was initially declared a suspect  
in her husband's killing is suing a county investigator and TV 
station for defamation, saying they should have known she had 
nothing to do with the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Terri Stokes is seeking unspecified damages from WCCO-TV; its  
owner, CBS Inc.; Anoka County; and county homicide investigator Tom 
Johnson. Jurors heard opening statements Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, 3M executive Dennis Stokes, was killed by shotgun  
blasts to the head while asleep in his bed in 1993. She had spent 
that night at her brother's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, who now lives in Mountain View, Idaho, claims her  
reputation was damaged by reports aired in 1994 by WCCO that showed 
Johnson saying she was the only suspect in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	There was never enough evidence to file charges against Stokes,  
a fact the television reports also aired. No arrests were ever 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before being falsely accused of murder she didn't have a  
reputation as a killer. Now she does,'' Stokes' attorney, Joe 
Friedberg, told the jury in his opening statement Monday in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedberg must prove Johnson and WCCO knew or could have known  
they were spreading false information. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's attorney, Anthony Palumbo, said Johnson had ``a lot of  
reasons for believing and concluding the way he did,'' and still 
believes Stokes was involved in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Palumbo said Stokes was evasive throughout the investigation,  
lied about extramarital affairs, hated the way her husband spent 
money and was not happy in marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes denies all those claims, Friedberg said.  
</P>
<P>
	TV station lawyer Michael Sullivan said reporter Tom Gasparoli  
did a thorough job of researching and reporting the story and 
repeatedly sought interviews with Stokes, but she refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terri did not offer any information to refute Johnson's  
conclusion,'' Sullivan said. ``She waits (until 1996) to let WCCO 
know that she has objections to the report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes also sued New York-based King World Productions, which  
produces the series ``American Journal.'' The company and Stokes 
settled over the weekend for undisclosed terms, according to a 
court official.

<HEADLINE> Ozawa To Leave Boston Symphony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Seiji Ozawa, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's  
longtime conductor and music director, will leave Boston after the 
2002 season to become conductor at the Vienna State Opera. 
</P>
<P>
	The formal announcement was expected Wednesday in Vienna.  
</P>
<P>
	Ozawa, 63, has led the symphony since 1973. He has been the  
longest-running music director in the orchestra's 117-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to his colleagues, Ozawa said he wanted to pursue  
his interest in operatic music. 
</P>
<P>
	``My relationship with the great Boston Symphony Orchestra has  
and continues to be the most rewarding artistic experience that a 
musician could ever hope to have,'' he said. ``However, in my own 
growth as a musician, I increasingly have come to love the operatic 
repertoire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last winter, Ozawa conducted Puccini's ``Madame Butterfly'' in  
Boston. He has also appeared as a regular guest conductor with 
major opera companies such as the Metropolitan Opera in New York 
and La Scala in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Symphony Orchestra Managing Director Mark Volpe told the  
Boston Herald that a search committee comprised of trustees, 
orchestra members and staff would be formed to search for a 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The orchestra is in good, stable financial health and,  
artistically speaking, it's highly regarded,'' he said. ``So it'll 
be a very interesting process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes at the end of a season-long celebration  
of Ozawa's quarter-century spent with the orchestra. On July 4, he 
is scheduled to lead the Boston Pops Esplanade Orchestra in its 
traditional ``1812 Overture.''

	BALMORAL, Scotland (AP) -- Prince Edward and his bride, Sophie,  
spent the third day of their Scottish honeymoon in the forests of 
the royal Balmoral estate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Earl and Countess of Wessex, who were married Saturday  
at Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel, flew by helicopter to the 
Scottish Highlands on Sunday after holding a champagne brunch at 
Bagshot Park, their home south of London. 
</P>
<P>
	In brilliant morning sunshine Tuesday, Edward and Sophie drove a  
Range Rover into the heart of Queen Elizabeth II's 50,000 acre 
estate in northeast Scotland. They took a private road that leads 
from Birkhall Lodge, the Queen Mother Elizabeth's Balmoral house, 
to a log picnic lodge in the Ballochbuie Forest. The lodge is 
surrounded by pine forests and bordered by a small loch, or lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the day police patrolled private roads leading into  
the Balmoral estate, which has been a favorite retreat for the 
royal family since Queen Victoria and Prince Albert bought it in 
1852. It is in an area of great natural beauty and its size 
provides privacy for the queen and her family.

big names in contention helped boost U.S. Open television ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's final-round coverage Sunday posted a 6.8 national rating  
and a 19 share, a 13 percent increase from 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	With Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and David Duval in the hunt  
entering the final day, NBC tied the rating for the 1997 finale as 
the highest final round since the network reacquired the event in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC also fared well for the third round on Saturday, getting a  
4.8 and a 15 share and easily beating the Women's World Cup on ABC 
and Fox's baseball game of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Cup match between the United States and Denmark had a  
2.2 overnight rating and a 6 share, while Fox posted a 2.8 
overnight mark. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's two-day average for the Open finished at 5.8/17, the  
second highest in 12 years and 7 percent higher than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the nation  
tuned to a program, and each network point represents 994,000 
homes. The share is the percentage tuned to a program among those 
televisions on at the time.

<HEADLINE> U S West Rebuffs Qwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a one-two punch, U S West Inc. became the  
second company in a week to reject, at least for now, a takeover 
bid from Qwest, which is trying to build a global 
telecommunications and Internet company. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West, the Denver-based Baby Bell, decided late yesterday to  
proceed with its $32.2 billion merger with Global Crossing Ltd., 
spurning a slightly higher rival bid from Qwest Communications 
International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest must now decide whether to raise its offer, take the  
proposal directly to U S West shareholders, or simply walk away. 
Joseph P. Nacchio, chairman and chief executive of Qwest, sent a 
letter today to the head of U S West in an effort to open 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Qwest and Global Crossing have ambitious plans to build  
global fiber optic cable networks to provide high-speed Internet 
access and other telecom services. The two companies both made 
offers to U S West and Frontier Corp., a Rochester, N.Y., 
long-distance and Internet company. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Frontier's board also decided to go forward with  
Global Crossing in a $11.5 billion merger. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West, however, issued a statement saying, ``At this time,  
the Board continues to believe its strategic merger with Global 
Crossing announced May 17 provides significant value to U S West's 
shareholders and will ensure that the strategic vision of U S West 
will be implemented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest, based in Denver, launched a $55 billion unsolicited offer  
for both U S West and Frontier on June 13. But the appeal of the 
deal faded on the first day of trading as investors pounded Qwest's 
stock price. Qwest's shares have regained some ground, but are 
still off about 19 percent from their pre-bid trading. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading Monday, Qwest's offer was worth about  
$44.1 billion, while Global Crossing's was worth about $43.6 
billion. The gap disappears, however, when including the break up 
fee U S West and Frontier would have had to pay to back out of 
their agreements with Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	But Qwest late Monday claimed its bid was still superior.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely disappointed at this,'' said Marc Weisberg,  
senior vice president of corporate development for Qwest. ``We had 
expected they would have acted in the best interest of their 
shareholders and feel they haven't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to elaborate on what Qwest's next step would be.  
</P>
<P>
	The vision all of these companies share is how to reshape their  
operations to meet the Internet age. As telephones, computers, 
televisions and radios become one, companies like Qwest and Global 
Crossing are racing to provide the wires that will carry enormous 
amounts of video, audio and data traffic to homes and businesses 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, a Bermuda-based company that is building an  
undersea cable network, was quick to claim victory Monday night, 
and is now hoping to avoid a drawn-out battle with Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain focused on completing both transactions as quickly  
as possible,'' Robert Annunziata, chief executive of Global 
Crossing, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's decision is also expected to be well received by the  
company's union workers, who were worried about an acquisition by 
Qwest which would lead to job cuts. The head of the Communications 
Workers of America warned the governors of the 14 states served by 
U S West that the proposed takeover would drain jobs and investment 
from the region and further imperil already-declining service 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's shares were off 62 1/2 cents at $57.68 3/4 in early morning  
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, where Frontier's shares were 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's stock was up 81 1/2 cents at $37.43 3/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where Global Crossing was up 43 3/4 cents at $47.75.

<HEADLINE>  Suspected Serial Killer Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GORHAM, Ill. (AP) -- As authorities search the state for a  
rail-rider suspected in a series of killings, anguish and relief 
have taken hold in the southern Illinois town where he is charged 
with killing a man and his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of people scared around here,'' said Ray Miller,  
a friend of one of the victims. ``I suppose if he was going to 
choose another person, though, he would have moved on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities think Rafael Resendez-Ramirez may have done just  
that: Hours after he was charged Monday in the Gorham killings, the 
FBI said it was investigating whether he was involved in two 
killings 335 miles away in northern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez, put on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list Monday,  
is wanted for questioning in five killings in Texas and one in 
Kentucky since August 1997. Authorities suspect he has been 
hitching rides on trains, finding his victims on or near the rails. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents in Texas say they are getting calls about  
Resendez-Ramirez from all over the country. The FBI in Wisconsin 
warned law enforcement agencies to be on the lookout. 
</P>
<P>
	And police in Columbus, Ohio, stopped a 75-car freight train  
today and searched it and the surrounding neighborhood. The search 
was later called off, said police Lt. Fred Bowitch. He said it was 
started after a witness offered ``a very good description of a male 
Hispanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez was charged in the June 15 deaths of George  
Morber Sr. and his daughter, Carolyn Frederick, Jackson County 
State's Attorney Mike Wepseic said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morber, 80, was shot in the head with a shotgun in his mobile  
home yards from a Union Pacific rail line. Investigators say they 
believe Resendez-Ramirez used the gun to fatally beat Frederick, 
52, in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Morber's truck was found Wednesday in a school parking lot in  
Cairo, about 60 miles south of Gorham. State's Attorney Mike 
Wepseic said fingerprints connect Resendez-Ramirez to the two 
southern Illinois slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings have resulted in unusual measures for this sleepy  
farm community of some 400 people about 110 miles southeast of St. 
Louis, where the tiny downtown and many homes face railroad tracks 
across two lanes of blacktop. Residents said they are locking their 
doors and being more cautious for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our community has just been stunned by this senseless act,''  
said Morber's son, Bill Morber. ``Everyone is scared, they're on 
edge, and I think they will be until this Ramirez is caught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Meade, who said she grew up with Frederick, said residents  
of the close-knit community of farmers and prison workers were 
particularly angry that the killings robbed Frederick's three grown 
children of their mother and Morber's ailing wife of her primary 
caretakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a good mother. He was a good man,'' she said.  
``Ramirez, he deserves to be blown away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI officials said the agency was assisting authorities in Jo  
Daviess County in northwest Illinois to determine whether two 
deaths in Apple River could be linked to Resendez-Ramirez. The 
agency also said it has been asked by authorities in Pontiac, 
southwest of Chicago, to look into a killing there for any possible 
link. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Darin J. Oellerich, 23, and Rhonda Sue Wurm, 25,  
were discovered Sunday in their rented farmhouse near a railroad 
line, the Jo Daviess County sheriff's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pontiac, the body of 40-year-old Juanita Sapp was discovered  
Wednesday in the bushes outside her apartment complex across the 
street from railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of those three killings have not been released. In most  
of the killings in which Resendez-Ramirez is suspected, the victims 
were beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's demonstrated he can use almost any kind of object to take  
a human life in a very violent manner, and we've got to try and 
catch him,'' said Don K. Clark, the special agent in charge of 
FBI's Houston office and leader of a nationwide task force 
searching for the suspect. The task force has more than 200 
investigators working the case. 
</P>
<P>
	As for a motive, Clark said: ``I wish I could tell you.''  
</P>
<P>
	The task force, assembled earlier this month after authorities  
allegedly connected the killings, has stopped and searched freight 
trains as part of its manhunt, and freight railroads have stepped 
up security, watching for drifters hopping trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Resendez-Ramirez, a 38-year-old native of  
Puebla, Mexico, has used numerous aliases and changes his 
appearance by altering his hair style and wearing glasses. He has 
scars on his right ring finger, left wrist and forehead, a snake 
tattoo on his left arm and may have a flower tattoo on his left 
wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-convict has a criminal record in California, Florida and  
New Mexico on weapons and burglary charges.

<HEADLINE> Julio Iglesias Daughter in Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- The 28-year-old daughter of singer  
Julio Iglesias was hospitalized after being thrown from a car when 
it collided with another vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Isabel ``Chabeli'' Iglesias was in serious condition  
at University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center. But a 
publicist for the singer said she was ``in excellent condition'' 
with fractures and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials did not clarify her status late Monday. A  
call to a hospital spokeswoman was not returned, and an operator 
said no patient named Iglesias was listed there. 
</P>
<P>
	A police statement said Isabel Iglesias was injured Sunday when  
a car driven by her friend, James Miller, collided with another 
vehicle on a city street at about noon. Both were ejected, the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller underwent surgery and was in serious condition, while the  
other driver was uninjured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer's publicist said Iglesias flew to Los Angeles from  
Miami after the accident to be with his daughter.

<HEADLINE> Digital Music Downloading To Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A popular pastime of home computer users  
is about to go retail: downloading music. 
</P>
<P>
	A Virgin Megastore opening June 30 on the outskirts of Columbus  
will have kiosks where consumers can compile a custom CD 
track-by-track from an on-screen list of different artists' work. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an idea the recording industry and its superstars have  
resisted because it could threaten the way they package and profit 
from their hit songs -- the ones that get people into stores to buy 
CDs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ravi Ahuja, vice president of business development at Virgin  
Entertainment Group in Los Angeles, said a limited number of songs 
would be available for compilation. He said consumers also could 
use the kiosks to recreate CDs that are out-of-print or not popular 
enough to be kept in stock, at a cost comparable to CDs on the 
store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't bill it as, `Get your new releases here.' As long as  
we market it properly, I don't think people will be disappointed,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahuja said Virgin will be ``the first music retailer to offer  
in-store downloading,'' although he said the kiosks have been tried 
out at a Disneyland gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Hardie, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge,  
Mass., said he doubts either the music industry or customers will 
be happy with the look of store-made CDs. They will be packaged in 
a standard plastic case, along with cover artwork and liner notes 
produced on a color printer behind the store counter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to look like some cheap copy,'' Hardie predicted.  
</P>
<P>
	The technology provider, California-based Digital On-Demand,  
announced an agreement earlier this month with Sony Music 
Entertainment to distribute more than 4,000 albums from its 
catalogs via a secure online channel called the Red Dot Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahuja and Digital On-Demand spokesman Hal Bringman believe  
Virgin and RedDotNet can persuade other record labels to follow 
Sony's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're in talks with all of them. Advanced talks, you could  
say,'' Bringman said from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahuja said Digital On-Demand will provide technicians to  
maintain the kiosks and printers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardie said a big risk for record stores that want to get into  
digital downloading is the expense of keeping trained technicians 
on hand or on call. He said sales clerks might be left fielding 
complaints or fiddling with computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	But record stores also are faced with concerns about how to  
compete with new digital compression formats, such as MP3, that 
give millions of people the capability of downloading and playing 
music off the Internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man already sentenced to die in Florida was  
convicted Tuesday of first-degree murder for strangling a woman in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The same jury that convicted Glen Rogers was to decide later  
whether he also should face a death sentence in California or get 
life in prison without chance of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, 38, was convicted of killing Sandra Gallagher in  
September 1995. The 33-year-old mother of three met Rogers in a bar 
and her body was found later in a burning truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claimed that was the first of several killings by  
Rogers during a month-long, cross-country crime wave in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his 1997 Florida conviction in the killing of a  
woman stabbed in a Tampa motel room, charges against him are 
pending in Jackson, Miss. Another alleged victim was found in 
Bossier City, La., but no charges were filed in that case.

<HEADLINE> Qwest Weighs Post-Rejection Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joseph Nacchio, head of Qwest Communications  
International Inc., is weighing his options now that his $31.7 
billion takeover offer for U S West Inc. has been rebuffed. Qwest 
shareholders appear to favor one of them in particular: Give up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Qwest ought to take its bid and go home,'' said Robert Loest,  
portfolio manager for the IPS New Frontier and IPS Millennium 
funds, which own about 100,000 shares of Qwest. ``This was an 
ill-considered bid in response to market pressure to consolidate in 
the telecommunications sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of mergers is reshaping telecommunications industries as  
companies vie to become leaders in new forms of communication, 
largely through the Internet. Qwest is building a global fiber 
optic cable network to carry video, audio and data traffic at high 
speeds to homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest wants to acquire U S West, a Denver-based Baby Bell, and  
Frontier Corp., a Rochester, N.Y., long-distance phone company, to 
boost its customers and sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Both targets, however, turned Qwest down in favor of offers from  
Global Crossing Ltd., a Bermuda-based company building an undersea 
cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West said it considered many factors in its decision,  
announced Monday night, including the ``significant volatility of 
the Qwest stock and the lack of downside protection if the Qwest 
stock were to decline as it did after Qwest announced its proposal 
on June 13.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's stock plunged 24 percent after the company announced its  
offer as investors criticized the company's strategy. The shares 
have regained a little ground, but are still off 21 percent. On 
Tuesday, shares traded at $35.31 1/4, off $1.31 1/4, on the Nasdaq stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Nacchio, who is Qwest's chairman and chief executive officer,  
sent a letter Tuesday to the head of U S West claiming his offer is 
superior to Global Crossing's. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to discussing our proposal with you,'' he  
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest could improve the terms of the deal by offering more cash,  
instead of its stock. Or, Qwest could structure its offer to 
protect the value of the deal in case its stock falls. 
</P>
<P>
	If U S West continues to play hard-to-get, Qwest could take its  
offer directly to U S West shareholders. But hostile proxy fights 
are expensive, and hard to win. And currently, Qwest's bid is 
slightly less than Global $32.1 billion offer, which has a collar 
to protect the value from stock fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest declined to discuss what steps it will take next, but one  
thing is clear: Nacchio not only has to sway U S West executives, 
he also has to sell many of his own investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Institutional investors are not pleased with Qwest pursuing U  
S West and Frontier,'' said F. Drake Johnstone, an analyst with 
Davenport &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Denver, Qwest is the nation's No. 4 long-distance  
company and has implemented an aggressive strategy to become a 
leader in high-speed Internet access for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest investors weren't expecting to the company to buy a  
slow-growth business like U S West's local phone service in 14 
states, or Frontier's rural long-distance operations. 
</P>
<P>
	While Nacchio said Qwest will be able to sell new technology and  
new products to customers of U S West and Frontier, he conceded his 
company's red-hot growth rate will slow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We bought a company that was a high-growth story,'' said  
Catherine Jackson, a managing for Trainer Wortham, which owns more 
than 500,000 shares of Qwest. ``The U S West and Frontier deals 
just changed that story.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Is Off Vs. Yen, Up Vs. Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen  
but finished higher against most other major currencies Tuesday in 
relatively quiet foreign exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 121.68 Japanese yen  
from 122.42 yen Monday. The euro was quoted at $1.0320, down from 
$1.0345. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar lost ground against the yen a day after surging while  
the Bank of Japan spent an estimated $5 billion buying dollars and 
selling yen in an effort to curb its own currency's rapid 
appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese authorities are worried that a strong yen will hurt  
exports and hamper the economy's ability to recover from recession. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no signs of intervention by the Bank of Japan on  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Guillermo Estebanez, a senior currency strategist  
at Bank of America in San Francisco, said few traders were 
``willing to bet heavily'' on the yen because of the chance the 
Japanese central bank would forcefully step in if the yen moved 
appreciably higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar advanced against the euro and other European  
currencies, however. ``The euro remains under a cloud,'' Estebanez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, European Commission President-designate Romano Prodi  
was reported to say that Italy might have to leave the Economic and 
Monetary Union because of its economic problems. Prodi later 
attempted to soften the impression left by the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Estebanez said even though few consider Italy's departure from  
the monetary union even a remote possibility, the episode left a 
``general negative feeling about the euro'' which replaced the 
currencies of Italy and 10 other European nations on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Estebanez said France reported a decline in  
industrial production for April, suggesting some economic weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a definite lack of appetite for European assets,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Against other currencies, the dollar was quoted at 1.5456 Swiss  
francs, up from 1.5428, and 1.4706 Canadian dollars, down from 
1.4714. The British pound fell to $1.5898 from $1.5913. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on the euro's exchange rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8952 
German marks, up from 1.8907; 6.3562 French francs, up from 6.3412; 
and 1,876.23 Italian lire, up from 1,872.66.

<HEADLINE> Valdez Captain Serves Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Capt. Joseph Hazelwood put on an apron  
and gloves Tuesday to help prepare salad at a soup kitchen as part 
of his community service over the Valdez oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
	After nine years of appeals, Hazelwood began his sentence of  
1,000 hours of service on Monday by loading roadside junk onto a 
truck. The move indoors will allow him more meaningful work, said 
his lawyer, Michael Chalos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, people would have loved to see him picking up trash, but  
that doesn't really give anything back to the community,'' Chalos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood was the skipper of the oil tanker Exxon Valdez when it  
ran aground in 1989, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil into 
Prince William Sound. It was the nation's worst oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted in 1990 of a misdemeanor charge of negligent  
discharge of oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood, 53, worked silently at the soup kitchen Bean's Cafe,  
emptying lettuce into a container for salad. He wouldn't answer 
reporters' questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one more set of hands to free up staff,'' said George  
Hieronymus, executive director of the soup kitchen.

<HEADLINE>  Real Soccer Moms Leave Their Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For a while in 1997, the anchors of the U.S. women's defense  
weren't hard to spot. Both looked as if they'd swallowed a soccer 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Joy Fawcett was pregnant with her second child, while Carla  
Overbeck was carrying her first. Both were approaching 30. 
</P>
<P>
	It could have been a critical juncture for the Americans,  
particularly if Overbeck, the team captain, and Fawcett, couldn't 
make it back. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that coach Tony DiCicco was worried.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was not much concern on my part because of the type of  
athletes they are,'' DiCicco said. ``They always are among our 
fittest players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Also, everything was planned. If you knew them, you knew they  
would be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fawcett, who gave birth to Carli that year -- her other daughter,  
Katelynn, is 5 -- and Overbeck, who delivered son Jackson in 1997, 
couldn't be so sure. They knew they wanted to return and be part of 
the Women's World Cup and next year's Olympics. But would their 
bodies allow them to stage such a comeback? 
</P>
<P>
	``You always wonder if you are jeopardizing your career,''  
Fawcett said. ``But it's what I wanted to do and we said we'd go 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a recurring thought: How will I make it back? It helped  
to hear from my teammates and to know they wanted me back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How could they not? DiCicco claims no defenders anywhere are  
more solid than Fawcett and Overbeck. Their teammates concur. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to marvel at them,'' Julie Foudy said. ``They  
haven't lost anything as players after taking the time off, and 
they're so happy as moms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It can be a bit exhausting, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize the time commitment it requires to have a  
child,'' said Overbeck, who like Fawcett is 31. ``Every second of 
the day is devoted to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it puts things in a greater perspective. No matter how  
tough a day you have at practice or how tough a game you have, he's 
there to cheer you up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's an added benefit of being a mom on the national team.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any time we've needed someone to watch the kids, well, I've  
got 19 built-in baby sitters,'' Overbeck said. ``I never was short 
on volunteers. We're all a bunch of kids on this team, anyhow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kids who play like veterans because, in general, that's what  
they are. The Americans, who beat Denmark in their opener and face 
Nigeria on Thursday in Chicago, rarely lose their cool. They play 
together, exhibiting trust in each other as well as in their 
individual skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a unique group,'' Fawcett said. ``That's one reason why  
I missed them so much when I was pregnant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Fawcett coached the UCLA women, who made the NCAA  
quarterfinals, and a youth team, while also playing for the 
national squad and handling motherhood. She resigned from UCLA at 
the end of '97, but said she'll consider a return to coaching after 
she retires as a player. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCicco recalls seeing Fawcett on the sidelines watching  
practice two weeks after giving birth to Carli. ``By the end of the 
week, she was scrimmaging with us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carla is the same way. These are amazing women who bounced  
right back and are playing at the highest level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the U.S. defense was virtually impenetrable in a 3-0  
victory over Denmark on Saturday. The Danes had a handful of decent 
scoring chances, but only a couple of truly dangerous ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit everyone, but especially the soccer moms.

<HEADLINE> Hideo Nomo Thrives With the Brewers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The New York Mets gave up on him during  
spring training. The Chicago Cubs felt he no longer had major 
league ability. The Milwaukee Brewers took a gamble on Hideo Nomo, 
and ended up with a staff ace. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight weeks after being released by his second team in as many  
months, Nomo has added zip to his pitches and still is tying 
hitters in knots with the split-finger fastball that made him the 
NL's top rookie in 1995 for the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just figured, `Let's take a shot, we have nothing to lose.'  
After the first time he threw, we knew the guy knew how to pitch,'' 
Brewers pitching coach Bill Campbell said. ``He's been a pleasant 
surprise. He's very smart. We haven't seen him get beat yet by a 
big hitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo improved to 5-1 by pitching seven strong innings Monday  
night in an 8-1 win over the San Francisco Giants. Nomo allowed one 
run on five hits in seven innings, striking out eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is he back? Oh, yeah, he's back. Every game he's pitched for  
us has been a good game,'' Milwaukee manager Phil Garner said. 
``The guy's amazing. He does something different that impresses you 
every time out. This time, I thought he had his best fastball of 
the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo no longer throws at 95-96 mph, as he did during his rookie  
season. But his split-finger fastball remains tough, and the 
Brewers have him throwing a few more curves. His unusual delivery, 
in which he twists his body so that his back faces the plate midway 
during his windup, continues to confuse hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hides the ball real good when he goes back and he still  
throws 90-91,'' Giants outfielder Armando Rios said. ``And when you 
start thinking about the fastball, he's got the split-finger. It's 
a guessing game. You can't find your rhythm against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After five seasons as a star in his native Japan, Nomo became an  
instant celebrity with the Dodgers and had a no-hitter during his 
3 1/2 seasons in Los Angeles. He was traded to the Mets in June 1998, 
but was waived by New York this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo signed a minor league deal with the Cubs and pitched in  
three Triple-A games, but was cut when he refused to stay in the 
minors for two more starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at the quality of his pitches and command,'' Cubs  
general manager Ed Lynch said after watching Nomo's third Triple-A 
start. ``We just didn't see the command or stuff that we felt was 
good enough to get major league hitters out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo had a workout with the Cleveland Indians, then signed a  
$250,000, one-year deal with the Brewers. He made one Double-A 
start, then joined Milwaukee and was the winner in his debut, a 3-2 
win at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo has regained some of his velocity since then, and was  
clocked at 92-93 mph on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's thrown well ever since we've seen him, though he was a  
little rusty in the beginning,'' Brewers catcher Dave Nilsson said. 
``Since we've had him, he's been dominating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo always has been at his best against the Giants, and  
especially in San Francisco. Many of his career highlights have 
come in San Francisco, where he is 5-0 with a 1.12 ERA. Overall, he 
is 7-2 against the Giants with a 1.84 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Nomo can't explain his success in San Francisco.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel no different pitching here than anywhere else I'm  
assigned to, but I broke into the major leagues at this park and 
those memories will stay with me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo made his major league debut in San Francisco in May 1995,  
pitching five scoreless innings for the Dodgers, and pitched a 
one-hit shutout -- taking a perfect game into the eighth inning -- 
later that season at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo threw a three-hitter last August for the Mets in San  
Francisco, and allowed one earned run in 6 1-3 innings in getting 
the win in his debut for Milwaukee last month against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get the same question every time Nomo comes in and I've got  
the same answer -- I don't know,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said 
of his team's futility against the right-hander. ``You need to ask 
him. Maybe it's the weather. Maybe this place reminds him of 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Home, for now, is in Milwaukee -- far from the spotlight in Los  
Angeles or New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people got too caught up in that speed thing -- you  
don't need to throw 94 mph to win -- and all the hoopla about him 
being Japanese and his windup,'' Campbell said. ``I'm sure he's 
glad he doesn't have the media entourage around in Milwaukee. I 
think he's a lot more comfortable here.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cub Ron Santo Is Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ron Santo, a former nine-time All-Star third  
baseman for the Chicago Cubs who became the team's radio 
commentator 10 years ago, showed improvement Tuesday following a 
mild heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Santo, 59, rested overnight at a Denver hospital and was no  
longer experiencing chest pains, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abnormalities in his heart's rhythm were being treated with  
medication, and he may be transferred out on intensive care by 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Santo, who hit .277 during a 15-year major league career, was  
admitted to Rose Medical Center in Denver on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Santo teammate Randy Hundley will replace him in the  
Cubs' radio booth on Thursday when the team finishes a three-game 
series with the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Santo has a history of diabetes and recently underwent an  
angiogram that revealed a minor blockage of one artery.

<HEADLINE> Surgeons Transplant Cadaver's Bone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Less than a year ago, 6-year-old Adam  
Johnson faced a grim situation: Either lose his arm to amputation 
or lose his life to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Happily, doctors came up with a third option.  
</P>
<P>
	A pioneering transplant operation nine months ago had the youth  
tossing a baseball around during a news conference Monday at Joe 
DiMaggio Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam, who lives with his family in Nassau, Bahamas, now wants to  
become a professional basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to thank the almighty God and the staff of the  
hospital,'' said Adam's overjoyed father, Anthony Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in September, doctors removed most of Adam's humerus, the  
upper arm bone, because of a tumor the size of a grapefruit. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors then replaced it by taking the humerus from a dead  
child and fused it with a piece of Adam's own fibula, the thin bone 
that runs from the knee to the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	In extremely rare circumstances, surgeons have successfully  
transplanted part of a patient's fibula to another part of the 
body, fusing it to whatever healthy tissue is left in the 
cancer-ravaged bone. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the fibula can fracture because of its narrow diameter.  
</P>
<P>
	In Adam's case, the surgeons decided to form a composite: They  
used part of Adam's fibula, with its blood supply and growth 
cartilage intact, and a cadaver bone to add strength and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadaver bones commonly are used in transplant surgery. But  
surgeons said this is the first time a live bone, with its blood 
supply intact, was combined with a cadaver bone so the transplant 
would grow along with the patient. 
</P>
<P>
	If the transplant continues to grow, Adam should have a  
full-size arm when he grows up, surgeons said. If he had received 
only a cadaver bone, he would forever have the arm of a little boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``A recent test has shown that the growth cartilage and blood  
supply to the transplanted fibula remain intact,'' said Dr. Michael 
Jofe, who led the 11-member surgical team. ``There's already been 
evidence that the bone is growing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not anything necessarily new and different, but it's  
really a new twist on old ideas. The combination is really the 
key,'' said Dr. Mark Thomas Scarborough, a member of the surgical 
team and chief orthopedic oncologist at Shands Hospital in 
Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors did not need to give Adam anti-rejection drugs because  
his own tissue was used in the procedure. They estimate there is a 
less than 10 percent chance the cancer could return to Adam's arm. 
The risk it may reappear somewhere else in his body is 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Five months before Adam's surgery, the boy underwent  
chemotherapy to shrink the tumor. He lost his hair, but never 
complained, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adam did extremely well, in no small part due to his  
indomitable spirit and the support of his family,'' Jofe said.

<HEADLINE> 'Tarzan,' 'Austin' Rule Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Forget about King of the Jungle -- ``Tarzan''  
is king of the box office. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first weekend, the animated Disney picture raked in $34.2  
million, seizing the No. 1 spot in North American theaters. Coming 
in second was the previous box-office champ, ``Austin Powers: The 
Spy Who Shagged Me.'' It garnered $31.4 million in its second week. 
</P>
<P>
	Another film that debuted this weekend, ``The General's  
Daughter,'' starring John Travolta, came in third with $22.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace'' remained strong,  
losing just 31 percent of its business in the fifth week, to bring 
its total to $328 million for sixth on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next few weeks, it is expected to easily pass No. 5  
``Forrest Gump'' ($330 million) and No. 4 ``Jurassic Park'' ($357 
million) as it seeks to challenge the original ``Star Wars'' ($461 
million) for second all-time behind ``Titanic'' ($600 million).

<HEADLINE> New Contest in the America's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Ever dream of sailing in the America's Cup?  
If you know a thing or two about boat parts, you may have a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne, a yacht racing syndicate trying to recapture the  
America's Cup, is throwing a contest for a spot on its crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch? The winner must design a ``jib halyard lock.''  
</P>
<P>
	The small mechanical device, about the size of a grapefruit, is  
attached to the mast and secures one of the sails. 
</P>
<P>
	``For your average Joe on the street, that might be a stretch,  
but your average worker in a machine shop, or an engineer or a 
sailor, could probably come up with some good ideas,'' said Bob 
Billingham, AmericaOne's chief operations officer. ``It's neat 
because it's part of the design for the America's Cup, but you 
don't need a degree in fluid dynamics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard, Engineering-e.com and AmericaOne are sponsoring  
the online contest. Contestants have until Sept. 1 to submit their 
entries and winners will be announced Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning jib halyard lock actually will be used on  
AmericaOne's entry, and the designer will earn the so-called ``17th 
man'' spot on one leg of the Round Robin I race of the Louis 
Vuitton Cup in New Zealand in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17th crew spot belongs to Hewlett-Packard, one of  
AmericaOne's sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like being in the huddle in the Super Bowl,'' said Knute  
Christensen, market development manager for HP's technical server 
business. ``It's an opportunity to see the sport up close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 17th crew position is reserved for observers, usually  
corporate sponsors or pals of the team's head honchos, and doesn't 
involve any real sailing. But the crew member gets to sit behind 
the wheel, near the skipper. In AmericaOne's case, that's renowned 
sailor Paul Cayard. 
</P>
<P>
	Another San Francisco team vying for the oldest trophy in  
professional sports, America True, recently held a radio contest 
for its 17th crew spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Both AmericaOne and America True will compete in October with 14  
other teams from around the world to determine who will challenge 
defending America's Cup holder New Zealand in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Jib halyard locks are new to the America's Cup. Previously, they  
weren't allowed because it was thought the device would delay the 
change of sails. 
</P>
<P>
	``The part is new, it has yet to really be used,'' Billingham  
said. ``We'll be using the one we designed for the first time in 
about three weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billingham said there's nothing really wrong with the current  
jib halyard lock, but there's always room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Marinaro, the director of sales and marketing at  
Engineering-e.com, a division of the MacNeal-Schwendler Corp., had 
a few tips for would-be contestants. 
</P>
<P>
	``This part is going to see some fairly high loads, and  
corrosive salt spray,'' he said. ``And it's got to weigh almost 
nothing.''

<HEADLINE>  Real Soccer Moms Leave Their Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For a while in 1997, the anchors of the U.S. women's defense  
weren't hard to spot. Both looked as if they'd swallowed a soccer 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Joy Fawcett was pregnant with her second child, while Carla  
Overbeck was carrying her first. Both were approaching 30. 
</P>
<P>
	It could have been a critical juncture for the Americans,  
particularly if Overbeck, the team captain, and Fawcett, couldn't 
make it back. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that coach Tony DiCicco was worried.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was not much concern on my part because of the type of  
athletes they are,'' DiCicco said. ``They always are among our 
fittest players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Also, everything was planned. If you knew them, you knew they  
would be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fawcett, who gave birth to Carli that year -- her other daughter,  
Katelynn, is 5 -- and Overbeck, who delivered son Jackson in 1997, 
couldn't be so sure. They knew they wanted to return and be part of 
the Women's World Cup and next year's Olympics. But would their 
bodies allow them to stage such a comeback? 
</P>
<P>
	``You always wonder if you are jeopardizing your career,''  
Fawcett said. ``But it's what I wanted to do and we said we'd go 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a recurring thought: How will I make it back? It helped  
to hear from my teammates and to know they wanted me back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How could they not? DiCicco claims no defenders anywhere are  
more solid than Fawcett and Overbeck. Their teammates concur. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to marvel at them,'' Julie Foudy said. ``They  
haven't lost anything as players after taking the time off, and 
they're so happy as moms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It can be a bit exhausting, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize the time commitment it requires to have a  
child,'' said Overbeck, who like Fawcett is 31. ``Every second of 
the day is devoted to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it puts things in a greater perspective. No matter how  
tough a day you have at practice or how tough a game you have, he's 
there to cheer you up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's an added benefit of being a mom on the national team.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any time we've needed someone to watch the kids, well, I've  
got 19 built-in baby sitters,'' Overbeck said. ``I never was short 
on volunteers. We're all a bunch of kids on this team, anyhow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kids who play like veterans because, in general, that's what  
they are. The Americans, who beat Denmark in their opener and face 
Nigeria on Thursday in Chicago, rarely lose their cool. They play 
together, exhibiting trust in each other as well as in their 
individual skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a unique group,'' Fawcett said. ``That's one reason why  
I missed them so much when I was pregnant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Fawcett coached the UCLA women, who made the NCAA  
quarterfinals, and a youth team, while also playing for the 
national squad and handling motherhood. She resigned from UCLA at 
the end of '97, but said she'll consider a return to coaching after 
she retires as a player. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCicco recalls seeing Fawcett on the sidelines watching  
practice two weeks after giving birth to Carli. ``By the end of the 
week, she was scrimmaging with us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carla is the same way. These are amazing women who bounced  
right back and are playing at the highest level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the U.S. defense was virtually impenetrable in a 3-0  
victory over Denmark on Saturday. The Danes had a handful of decent 
scoring chances, but only a couple of truly dangerous ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit everyone, but especially the soccer moms.

<HEADLINE> Gehry To Design Corcoran Addition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Frank O. Gehry, architect of the Guggenheim  
Museum Bilbao in Spain, has been selected to design an addition 
that will double the size of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, 
Washington's oldest art museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition, expected to cost about $40 million, will house  
Corcoran's art school and provide space for an expanded children's 
education center. The museum is at 17th Street and New York Avenue, 
two blocks from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Gehry was chosen, said Corcoran President David C. Levy, because  
he ``looked at this building as a totality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In his presentation, instead of saying here is my building, he  
started in the basement and worked his way up,'' Levy told The 
Washington Post. ``Then he said here is how we will enclose these 
spaces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gehry submitted a preliminary vision of the addition that would  
contrast sharply with the nearby Constitution Hall and Old 
Executive Office Building. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the Post via telephone from Prague on Monday: ``It's a  
starting point and I am not married to any of the images.''

<HEADLINE> Iridium Cuts Prices of Sat. Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iridium, the troubled maker of go-anywhere  
satellite telephones, said Monday it would cut prices up to 65 
percent as part of an ongoing attempt to jump start its business. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves are part of a new marketing strategy and follow staff  
cuts intended to reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Iridium, which offers wireless phone service from virtually  
anywhere in the world, has signed up only 15,000 subscribers, far 
short of its goal of a half-million subscribers by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The price cuts, effective July 1, include a new international  
flat rate of about $3 a minute, down from $7 a minute when the 
service was introduced in November. Calls within Europe or the 
United States and Canada will cost less than $2.50 a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Iridium also will shift its marketing focus from business  
travelers to the boating and agriculture industries and government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``To reach these markets we've got to have a simpler pricing  
structure that does not leave our customers vulnerable to high 
per-minute charges,'' said John Richardson, chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola Inc. and Kyocera Corp., which produce Iridium's  
portable electronics, will begin selling satellite phones for less 
than $1,000, down from more than $3,000 in some markets. Motorola 
owns 18 percent of Iridium. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Iridium fired 15 percent of its 550  
employees, including most of its marketing executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial marketing strategy targeted high-end business users  
but was flawed, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of very bright scientists got together and produced  
something that had immense commercial application ... but didn't 
really give much thought as to how they were going to sell it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Monday's price cuts, Iridium's beaten-down stock rose  
$1.28 1/8, or 17 percent, to $9.03 1/8 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, but 
its shares are still down 85 percent from its 52-week high of 
$61.62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts remained skeptical it will succeed.  
</P>
<P>
	Marc Crossman, a J.P. Morgan analyst, has downgraded his  
``neutral'' rating on the company since it announced the 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	He now expects the company to underperform the market. ``I  
wouldn't think of owning it until after the restructuring,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iridium recently completed a 66-satellite ``constellation'' when  
it launched two backup satellites. The company said it is 
continuing to work with its lenders to restructure its financing.

<HEADLINE> Doctor: Gordon Needs 5-6 Weeks Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Boston Red Sox reliever Tom Gordon has been  
told by doctors to rest his ailing right elbow for at least five 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon was placed on the disabled list June 14 with an elbow  
strain. After consulting with Dr. James Andrews in Alabama, the 
right-hander was told that he has a strained ligament in the elbow 
and must take an extended break. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said there is a very good chance that it can heal, but it's  
not going to happen if I go out and throw right away,'' Gordon said 
Tuesday before the Red Sox opened a three-game series against the 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, 0-1 with a 4.50 ERA and 11 saves, said Andrews suggested  
he rest 5-6 weeks. He had his major league-record string of 
converting 54 straight save opportunities end on June 5, and six 
days later blew a second straight save for the first time in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	In other news, the Red Sox plan to activate right-hander Bret  
Saberhagen from the disabled list Wednesday and start him against 
the Orioles. Saberhagen was placed on the DL on June 12, 
retroactive to June 8, after cutting his left foot during a pool 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen is 2-2 with a 2.70 ERA this season.

<HEADLINE> Barak Reopens Talks With Likud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The hawkish Likud party is likely to join Prime  
Minister-elect Ehud Barak's government after reaching an 
understanding on how to approach negotiations with the Palestinians 
and Syria, senior Likud officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak's dovish allies expressed concern, saying they feared  
bringing Likud into the government would slow peacemaking. Barak 
has said he wants to establish the broadest coalition possible to 
give him a free hand in peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting Likud chief Ariel Sharon, who served as foreign minister  
under outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, met unexpectedly 
late Monday with Barak, a moderate who has until July 9 to put 
together a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men held talks at the start of coalition negotiations  
several weeks ago, but at the time failed to reach agreement on 
crucial peace issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon opposes territorial concessions to Syria in the Golan  
Heights and wants to keep most of the West Bank under Israeli 
control. Sharon said today that he believed the way had been paved 
for Likud to join a coalition, but did not say what has changed 
since the initial coalition talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, it's possible to form a government in which the  
Likud will be a real partner and can participate in the fateful 
decisions that stand before all of us,'' Sharon told Israel radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon said he expected the two parties could overcome the  
remaining hurdles in the coalition talks quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Outgoing Science Minister Silvan Shalom of Likud said Sharon and  
Barak had worked out an understanding prior to a final coalition 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``They reached a general agreement on ... the final status talks  
(with the Palestinians), the Golan Heights, Jerusalem, the priority 
of the settlements,'' Shalom said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Libai, a negotiator for Barak's One Israel alignment, told  
Israel army radio that Barak was ``very serious'' about bringing 
Likud into the government. One Israel is an umbrella group 
including the Labor party and the moderate Meimad and Gesher 
factions. 
</P>
<P>
	``One Israel expects fast and focused negotiations that will  
increase the chances for a wide government,'' said a statement by 
the alignment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yossi Beilin, a dovish legislator in Barak's Labor Party,  
said he feared Likud could slow peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Beilin said Likud would not be invited into the government if it  
demanded that Barak prevent the formation of a Palestinian state, 
the key Palestinian demand in the peace process. A previous Likud 
stipulation that Barak refuse to withdraw from the Golan Heights -- 
a Syrian condition for a peace agreement -- would also be 
unacceptable, he added.

<HEADLINE> Unlicensed Insurance Broker Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Authorities are searching for an  
unlicensed money manager who vanished, allegedly with millions of 
dollars in clients' money, and left behind burned, shredded 
documents and astrological charts. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates of the amount of money missing range from $218 million  
to $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Frankel has been missing since May 5, when firefighters  
went to his high-security mansion and found a blazing file cabinet 
and two fireplaces stuffed with burning documents. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in Bridgeport has been investigating  
Frankel and his brokerage since mid-May. The New York Daily News 
reported today, citing unidentified law enforcement sources, that a 
sealed warrant had been issued for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, insurance company regulators said Frankel's  
unlicensed brokerage was responsible for the disappearance of 
assets from a dozen small insurance firms in five states. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies, based in Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee,  
Missouri and Arkansas, were placed in receivership when they were 
unable to account for assets that had been invested with Frankel's 
Liberty National Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI affidavit said: ``Frankel systematically drained these  
assets through various financial accounts and transferred them into 
accounts in and outside this country under his control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say the insurance companies are missing at least $218  
million, but a lawsuit filed by some of the companies puts the loss 
at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing is as much as $1.98 billion from the St. Francis of  
Assisi Foundation, which investigators say was established by 
Frankel in the British Virgin Islands last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, 44, had turned his $3 million home into a warren of  
offices with nearly 100 computers and wide-screen televisions tuned 
to financial news channels, according to court papers filed by the 
FBI. Some of the rooms had electronic locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the papers seized was a handwritten list of tasks such as  
``launder money,'' investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also seized, according to the FBI affidavit, were personalized  
astrological charts answering such questions as: ``Will I go to 
prison?'' ``Should I leave?'' and ``Will I be safe?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials have said Frankel used several aliases  
after being barred from trading by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Tuesday,  
with the key index rising in Tokyo for a second straight session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 38.77  
points, or 0.22 percent, ending the day at 17,777.62. On Monday, 
the average rose 307.59 points, or 1.76 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices rose early in the day as investors bought high-technology  
shares and blue-chip exporters. But stocks fell as the day went on 
and the market traded mostly lower before rising on buying by 
foreign investors, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell against the yen as Japanese life  
insurers and exporters sold the U.S. currency in the absence of 
intervention by the Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 121.91 yen, down 0.43 yen from late  
Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 122.42 
yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks closed slightly higher, with the key index  
rising above the 14,000 points for the first time since the Asian 
financial crisis engulfed the territory in October, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 10.65 points, or 0.08  
percent, to close at 14,004.88. On Monday, the index had surged 
585.96 points, or 4.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said there was continued selective buying of blue chip  
stocks following Monday's announcement by the government that it is 
to sell stocks it bought 10 months ago to shore up the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the sale of the stocks, worth U.S. $26  
billion, would be carried out in an orderly manner without 
disrupting the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said that government plans to sell its shareholdings  
through mutual funds eased investor fears that the stocks would be 
dumped directly onto the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Taiwan closed sharply higher, with the key index  
rising to a 14-month high after the government announced that 
Taiwan's industrial output rose a better-than-expected 10.76 
percent in May from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's Weighted Stock Price Index rose 195.43  
points, or 2.3 percent, to 8,608.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 5.97 points, or 0.2 percent, 
to 2,095.87. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher, spurred by expectations  
of a further softening of domestic interest rates. The 30-company 
Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 29.99 points, or 1.2 percent, 
to 2,478.61. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed higher, mostly on  
renewed domestic and overseas investor interest in Australia's 
leading industrial stocks. The All Ordinaries Index rose 23.1 
points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,004.8. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher for the fifth consecutive  
session. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 6.97 points, or 
0.8 percent, to 875.97, its highest level since June 11, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mixed. The benchmark Straits  
Times Index rose 2.85 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,123.23. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed higher despite some late  
profit-taking. The Composite Index rose 7.41 points, or 0.9 
percent, to 793.43. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher amid declining interest  
rates and a positive mood toward economic recovery. The SET index 
rose 7.55 points, or 1.4 percent, to 545.91. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed mixed. The Composite Index  
fell 5.778 points, or 0.8 percent, to 710.682.

or 0.22 percent, ending the day at 17,777.62. On Monday, the 
average closed up 307.59 points, or 1.76 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped as players nudged the  
U.S. currency down to see how low the Bank of Japan will let it go, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Bank of Japan intervened several times to buy  
dollars and sell yen to stem the Japanese currency's rise. It was 
the fourth action by Japan's central bank in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recent fast rise in the yen is due to excessive hopes for  
a Japanese economic recovery. I think the rise is disruptive to the 
market, and the purpose of recent interventions was to preempt such 
moves,'' Japan's Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said at a regular 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the market is far from bullish on the dollar.  
</P>
<P>
	``Other than short-term interbank speculators hoping for  
intervention, there are really no dollar buyers,'' said Takeo 
Suzuki, assistant foreign exchange manager at Nomura Trust and 
Banking. 
</P>
<P>
	Although recent government data indicate signs of improvement in  
Japan's economy, the nation is still struggling to overcome its 
worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's repeated interventions are seen as an attempt  
to ensure that the nascent recovery is not torpedoed by the yen's 
sudden surge. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.94 yen, down  
from 126.66 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices rose early in the day as investors  
bought high technology shares and blue chip exporters. But stocks 
fell as the day went on and the market traded mostly lower before 
rising on buying by foreign investors, traders said.

<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 6.59 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,425.64. The 
TOPIX rose 22.76 points, or 1.63 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines by 606 to 597,  
with 116 issues unchanged. Volume on the first section was 
estimated at 612.57 million shares, up from Monday's 546.19 
million.

	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.6950 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7500 percent,

<HEADLINE> ADC Telecom Gets Saville Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNETONKA, Minn. (AP) -- ADC Telecommunications Inc. is  
acquiring software developer Saville Systems in a stock swap worth 
about $675 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition will help Minnetonka-based ADC better compete in  
selling networks to local telephone companies, wireless phone 
service companies and, eventually, cable TV companies, ADC said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	ADC supplies voice, video and data systems and software for  
communications networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Saville, which has headquarters in Burlington, Mass., but has  
legal status as an Irish company, develops software that can 
include many telecommunications services on a single phone bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The battle among communications service providers is  
increasingly centered on services rather than technology, and these 
services can only be managed effectively through software,'' said 
William Cadogan, ADC's chairman and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition is part of ADC's strategy of increasing the  
percentage of its revenue that comes from computer software, which 
typically has a higher gross profit margin than computer hardware 
does. 
</P>
<P>
	Each Saville share will be exchanged for 0.358 ADC shares,  
valuing the deal at about $675 million based on ADC's closing share 
price Monday of $47.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition, expected to close by Oct. 31, has been approved  
by boards of both companies but still requires review by the U.S. 
and Irish governments as well as shareholders 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition would combine ADC's 9,600 employees with 1,500  
from Saville, located mainly in the Boston area; Toronto; Edmonton, 
Alberta; Galway, Ireland; and Brisbane, Australia. No layoffs are 
expected.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Is Out of the Dog House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NESBIT, Miss. (AP) -- Jerry Lee Lewis is out of the doghouse:  
Officials have decided to drop a charge accusing him of violating 
the county's dog leash law. 
</P>
<P>
	However, DeSoto County prosecutor David Adams said the rocker's  
wife, Kerrie Lewis, will plea no-contest to the charge and pay a 
$50 fine plus court costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mildred Yancey, one of Lewis' neighbors, filed two complaints in  
November against the couple. Yancey complained that the couple's 
dogs were running loose in the neighborhood and causing damage to 
her shrubbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said four dogs were picked up by animal control officials.  
</P>
<P>
	He said the complaint against Lewis will be dropped because  
there was no proof the dogs belonged to him. Adams said Mrs. Lewis 
picked the dogs up from the kennel and he assumed that meant the 
animals were hers.

<P>
	LET'S FACE IT, THE PC MAKES EVERYTHING ELSE POSSIBLE: Americans  
love eating and watching TV (often doing both at the same time), 
but they're likely to say that the computer is a bigger 
technological wonder than television or the refrigerator. Harris 
Corp., a communications equipment maker, commissioned a survey of 
more than 1,000 people in which 40 percent named the computer as 
the top technological achievement of the 20th century. TV and the 
fridge were far behind, each cited by 12 percent of respondents. 
No. 4 was medical advances, named by 6 percent of those surveyed, 
and rounding out the top five was the Internet, named by 5 percent. 
Ask these same people which 20th century technology was most 
important in their lives, and the computer, TV and refrigerator 
again make the top three, but the microwave oven and washing 
machine are Nos. 4 and 5, respectively.

	CHILDREN TRAVELING ALONE: Many children will be traveling alone  
to camp or to visit relatives this summer, and Fodor's Travel 
Publications and the American Society of Travel Agents have 
suggestions to make the trip easier on everyone. If the child is 
flying, they say, book a morning flight; if it's delayed or 
canceled, there's still time to make alternate arrangements that 
day. Try to get a nonstop flight, and get to the airport early. See 
if the airline supplies escorts for children. It's also a good idea 
to prepare the child for what to expect in every part of the trip. 
And give your child a little surprise -- packing a new book or toy 
or game in their carry-on bag -- that can give them a smile while 
they're en route.

	SHORT-TERM TRADING: Most investors put their money into mutual  
funds for the long term, expecting to hold their shares for at 
least several years, but some are short-term traders, hopping in 
and out of funds in a matter of months. Individual Investor 
magazine notes that some fund supermarkets, which provide one-stop 
shopping for a wide variety of funds, are beginning to impose fees 
on investors who sell funds held less than 180 days, or about six 
months. Those charging include Fidelity FundsNetwork and Schwab's 
Mutual Fund OneSource. But the magazine warns fund-hoppers who 
figure they'll just take their business elsewhere that short-term 
trading isn't a good investment strategy -- capital gains taxes may 
well take a huge chunk of whatever money your funds earned.

<HEADLINE>  Stars Aiming To Keep Cup in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Stars coach Ken Hitchcock is so  
giddy over winning the Stanley Cup that he's already talking about 
another championship -- and another after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we've got one of these, why not make it two? Aw,  
let's go for three,'' Hitchcock told 20,000 fans at a pep rally 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning two more titles is an ambitious goal for a franchise  
that waited an NHL-record 32 years for its first crown. The wait 
ended early Sunday with a six-game victory over the Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars can hope for more titles because all of their key  
players -- Mike Modano, Brett Hull, Joe Nieuwendyk and Ed Belfour -- 
will be back next season, and some for even longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody realizes how difficult it is to do this, but  
we're going to have a lot of the nucleus back next year so there's 
no reason why we can't make a run at it again,'' said Nieuwendyk, 
the postseason MVP. ``It will be a challenge, but Detroit did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings were NHL champs in 1997 and 1998, and the  
Pittsburgh Penguins repeated in 1991-92. The last team to win three 
in a row was the New York Islanders, who actually won four straight 
from 1980-83. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' toughest challenge might be finding the proper  
motivation. The team was driven this year to win another Cup for 
former champions whose careers were winding down and to get a first 
championship for title-less stars Modano, Hull and Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you want to silence everybody who may have thought it  
was a fluke, that you had a lucky year,'' Modano said. ``I think if 
you do it again it really puts and end to those rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock said he plans to start from scratch.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have to start from Day 1 with the total assumption  
you have nothing going, then start building again,'' he said. ``You 
can't go out there and say `Modano, (Jere) Lehtinen and Hull -- 
we'll put that together and it'll be automatic.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe Brett Hull had a tough summer. Maybe he wants to be more  
of an impact player. Maybe Jere Lehtinen wants to be more of a 
scorer. You don't know those things. You have to let it evolve, 
read off it and then rebuild it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' changes already have begun. Backup goalie Roman Turek  
was traded Sunday to avoid losing him in the expansion draft 
Thursday. The entry draft is Saturday and the free-agent signing 
period opens next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars have five veterans signed to long-term contracts and  
eight more signed through next season. The team holds the option on 
the contracts of five players, the biggest contributors being 
39-year-old Guy Carbonneau and 38-year-old Craig Ludwig. 
</P>
<P>
	Their top unrestricted free agents are Pat Verbeek and Dave  
Reid. Richard Matvichuk is a restricted free agent, but owner Tom 
Hicks will surely match any offer and keep him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have turnover every year and guys move on,'' Modano said.  
``Winning kind of puts that ante a little higher for teams to make 
a run at players who have that experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Verbeek isn't likely to get another $3.2 million salary from  
Dallas, but at a cheaper price, he could be welcomed back. Fans 
already have begun a ``Sign Verbeek'' bumper-sticker campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Keane screamed that rallying cry through the locker room  
Tuesday as Verbeek discussed his status. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may want to be here and they might not want me to be here,''  
he said. ``We'll see where it goes.''

<HEADLINE> Novartis Plans To Cut 1,100 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Novartis  
plans to cut 1,100 jobs worldwide from its struggling agricultural 
division over two years in a bid to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The company hopes to make the cuts, which amount to 6.1 percent  
of the 18,000 people employed in the division, through early 
retirement and internal transfers but did not rule out layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	It expects the cuts will result in savings of $65 million a  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150-200 of the jobs lost will come from the company's  
Basel headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural division head Heinz Imhof said the move will give  
Novartis ``full flexibility'' to maneuver in a changing environment 
in Europe and the Americas, and to adapt to lower farm subsidies 
and commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter of 1999 the division's sales fell by 10  
percent to $1.56 billion. The agricultural division deals with crop 
protection, animal health and seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis became the world's third biggest pharmaceuticals  
company when it was created in the 1996 merger of Ciba-Geigy and 
Sandoz. 
</P>
<P>
	In March the company posted overall net profits of 6 billion  
Swiss francs, or $4 billion, up from 5.21 billion francs a year 
earlier.

<HEADLINE> Duncan's Supporting Cast Disappears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lost in New York.  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that explains the recent disappearance of Tim Duncan's  
supporting cast in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Duncan had his worst game of the finals in Game 3, he got  
little help from teammates other than David Robinson. The Spurs, an 
efficient, multidimensional machine during a 12-game playoff 
winning streak, suddenly became predictable and ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	Simply put, Duncan needs more help in Game 4 Wednesday night, or  
the resilient New York Knicks might really make this series 
interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	``They beat up our guys last night,'' said Spurs guard Mario  
Elie, who got into foul trouble and scored only six points. 
</P>
<P>
	``They outhustled us,'' said Sean Elliott, whose seven points on  
3-for-9 shooting won't do as a perimeter threat to complement 
Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard Avery Johnson, who scored 10 points but struggled to  
get the Spurs' offense in sync, was so bewildered by the loss that 
he wouldn't even talk with his wife about it during their cab ride 
to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be a good day,'' Johnson said Tuesday. ``We  
hate to lose. It's not just me. It's not a good feeling. This is a 
strange day for us, the day after a loss. But we're excited about 
getting back on the court as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When they do, the Spurs will be trying to avoid what seemed  
unthinkable when they left San Antonio four days ago -- facing a 
series tied 2-2 with still another game to play at Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	If precedent means anything, the Spurs haven't lost consecutive  
games since February, when they began the season 6-8. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what it's like to come off a loss,'' said Antonio  
Daniels, whose early 3-point shooting was not matched by Elliott, 
Elie, or anybody down the stretch. ``I think we'll respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan was dominant in the first two games in San Antonio,  
averaging 29 points and 15.5 rebounds. But in each game, he and 
Robinson got a significant boost from outside shooters of varying 
identities and backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaren Jackson, a rare shooter produced by John Thompson at  
Georgetown, dropped 17 points on the Knicks in a crucial reserve 
role in Game 1. In Game 2, all of Elie's 15 points seemed to come 
at clutch moments. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, Elliott was 1-for-5 on 3-pointers, Jackson  
didn't score and Elie was ineffective because of foul trouble. He 
had six points and five fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	And Elie was the last Spurs player anyone expected to get lost  
during a big game in the Big Apple. He grew up in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``We became a little too predictable, just coming down and  
tossing it inside,'' Elliott said. ``We can't throw it in to the 
horses every time and expect something to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson had 25 points, but the Spurs needed more than an inside  
game. The only signs of life on the perimeter came from Daniels, 
who hit two early 3-pointers to prevent the Knicks from leading by 
more than 14 points in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mario's a little upset, and J.J.'s a little upset  
because they didn't get the minutes they usually get to perform,'' 
Daniels said. ``Tim didn't have his usual Tim Duncan-type game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich finds himself in the  
unfamiliar position of having to come up with answers after a loss. 
The Spurs must cast aside what has become their mantra in this 
series: They don't have to adjust; the Knicks do. 
</P>
<P>
	Not true anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	``We feel the same,'' Duncan said. ``It's not out of control and  
it's not in control. It's right there where it can swing either 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new twist, indeed.

<HEADLINE> Fiennes Leads 'Hamlet' Workshop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Ralph Fiennes drew from his past to give hope to a  
new generation of young thespians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academy Award-nominated actor held a ``Hamlet'' workshop for  
about 20 students Tuesday at the LOST Youth Theatre, which launched 
his acting career. The theater is under threat because its home for 
the past 20 years is being demolished. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being a member of the company gave me the confidence to apply  
to drama school,'' Fiennes told the students. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiennes also is a patron of LOST Youth, which gets its name from  
its original home, London Oratory School Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons that these youth theaters are so important  
is because it is now terribly difficult for actors to get grants to 
go to drama school,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are lots of kids who would like to go and can't actually  
afford to and, while they don't actually pretend to be schools, 
theaters like this offer a fantastic opportunity to learn their 
craft in a fairly disciplined way.''

<HEADLINE> Energy Sec. Vows Wind Power Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- The nation's wind power advocates  
are back from nearly two decades of exile. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Monday committed the  
government to increasing the amount of electricity produced by wind 
by 50 times over the next 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those meetings that years from now, 2010, I  
will say I was there when we launched a major initiative that 
changed the energy future of our country,'' Richardson said at a 
meeting of wind power engineers from across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	To accomplish the goal of having 5 percent of the nation's  
electrical power come from wind by 2020, Richardson promised 
continued economic support for wind energy research and development 
and support for a variety of tax incentives and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's message was welcome news to wind advocates.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've been wandering in the wilderness since the Carter  
administration,'' said Tom Gray, the deputy executive director of 
American Wind Energy Association, which sponsored the four-day 
conference attended by about 600 wind engineers from around the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had consistent support, but in the past it's been a much  
more generic support,'' Gray said. ``To have him come in and say 
'Yeah, I'm committed to wind' -- that's a whole different level of 
endorsement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, about one-tenth of one percent of the nation's  
electric needs are provided by the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want tomorrow's generators to produce power at half the  
cost of today's machines,'' Richardson said. ``That is no small 
challenge, but this Administration is committed to making that goal 
a reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Wind Powering America initiative, Richardson  
on Monday announced $1.2 million in grants to wind turbine testing 
projects in 10 states. The money will be used to provide support 
for the design and installation of new small wind turbines for 
field testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson formally unveiled the new initiative at the wind  
association's annual meeting in South Burlington. Vermont has 
traditionally been a leader in alternative energy sources and, 
until the 1970s, had been home to the largest wind turbine ever 
built -- the ``Putnam'' machine that ran from 1941 to 1945 in 
Rutland, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department will invest money in research and development of  
wind power, encourage codes that are conducive to wind energy and 
encourage vocational schools to provide training in the necessary 
technology, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said that in the early to mid 1980s, the United States had  
about 90 percent of the world's wind generating capacity. But when 
the tax incentives dried up during the Reagan years, interest 
waned. Now the figure is about 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet in 1980 wind energy cost about 40 cents per kilowatt hour.  
Now it's about a nickel. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you compare today's technology with that of the early  
'80s, it's clear how far we've come,'' Richardson said.

<HEADLINE> Fans To Choose All-Century Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fans will get a chance to vote for the top 25  
players of the 20th century under a promotion announced Tuesday by 
Major League Baseball and MasterCard International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of experts selected by former Chicago Tribune baseball  
writer Jerome Holtzman, now baseball's official historian, and the 
commissioner's office will select 100 players for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans will vote from July 13-Sept. 10, selecting two players at  
each infield position, two catchers, six pitchers and nine 
outfielders for an All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The panel has the ability to add up to five additional names  
so that we can bring it into balance, so it's not just pure 
popularity of voting,'' said Kathy Francis, baseball's vice 
president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will be announced before Game 1 of the World Series on  
Oct. 23, and the panel will select a 10-man starting lineup 
(including a right-handed and a left-handed pitcher), which will be 
announced before Game 2 the following night. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will sit in the coffee shops in the morning with their  
paper and you'll see them arguing, you'll see them arguing which 
was the greatest player -- Mantle, Mays or DiMaggio,'' said former 
Cincinnati and Detroit manager Sparky Anderson, the program's 
spokesman. ``There is no answer. That's why baseball is the 
greatest mystery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis said that banned players, including Pete Rose, are  
eligible for the team but would not be able to participate in any 
ceremonies or functions if they are picked. 
</P>
<P>
	A commercial featuring Hank Aaron, George Brett, Willie Mays and  
Barry Bonds will start airing around the time of the All-Star game 
on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballots will be available at all major league ballparks, and  
fans can vote on baseball's Web site in a process similar to the 
vote for All-Star starters. 
</P>
<P>
	MasterCard will put a special advertising insert in Sports  
Illustrated, even though the company last week sued the magazine's 
parent, Time Warner Inc., over an ad for the HBO show ``Arli$$.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disputed ad mimics MasterCard advertising. ``There are some  
men money can't buy. Arliss isn't one of them,'' the ad says.

<HEADLINE> 3-Point Line Poses Problem For U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Coach Oliver Purnell knows he will have size  
and speed on the U.S. team for the World University Games. The 
biggest uncertainty is how well his players will shoot from the 
international 3-point line. 
</P>
<P>
	When the team begins the games July 3 in Palma de Mallorca off  
the coast of Spain, it will be shooting 3-pointers from at least 
20 1/2 feet, nine inches further from the basket than the U.S. college 
3-point line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some size. We've got some outstanding quickness and  
athleticism on the wing,'' Purnell said Tuesday. ``The one question 
mark we need to answer is are we going to be able to consistently 
hit that 3-point shot? 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe it or not, that little bit of distance makes a  
difference because you're just not used to being out that far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The finalists have started a week of workouts at the University  
of Dayton Arena under the watchful eye of Purnell, Dayton's coach. 
Sixteen college players are seeking 12 roster spots. The cuts are 
expected to be announced by the time the workouts end Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The squad has guards that include Ohio State's Scoonie Penn and  
Michael Redd, plus Erick Barkley (St. John's), Robert O'Kelley 
(Wake Forest), Matt Santangelo (Gonzaga) and Cory Bradford 
(Illinois). 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's Pete Mickeal and Kenyon Martin are among the  
forwards, along with Mark Madsen (Stanford), Marcus Fizer (Iowa 
State), Kevin Freeman (Connecticut) and Chris Carrawell (Duke). 
</P>
<P>
	There are three big centers -- 7-footers Brendan Haywood (North  
Carolina) and Chris Mihm (Texas) and 6-11 Joshua Asselin 
(Michigan). The 6-8 Etan Thomas (Syracuse) is listed as a 
forward-center. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, players ran drills and played 3-on-3 and a brief  
half-court scrimmage. A few missed passes suggested they were still 
learning each other's moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Purnell said the squad is loaded with talent and that making the  
final cuts will be difficult. He said he is looking for team 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt that these guys were the kind of kids that would play  
any role that you want them to play,'' he said. ``Most of them are 
from winning programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said one reason Penn and Redd are among the finalists is  
because they helped Ohio State get to the NCAA Final Four last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing together certainly helps them,'' Purnell said. ``They  
know each other. You can just hear them out there communicating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said putting on the USA jersey for the first time was a  
special feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like my first time putting an Ohio State jersey on,''  
Redd said. ``It's a great honor. A lot of players that played here 
are in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team has won 32 straight games and five consecutive  
gold medals at the games.

<HEADLINE> Moni Maker Passes Physical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Moni Maker, harness racing's horse  
of the year in 1998, is doing well after experiencing an irregular 
heartbeat during a race at the Meadowlands last week, an assistant 
trainer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her heart converted back to a normal rhythm, and she's back  
home now,'' said Conny Svensson, an assistant to trainer Jimmy 
Takter. 
</P>
<P>
	Moni Maker experienced arterial fibrillation on Friday night in  
an elimination for the Titan Cup, a race for trotters. The 
6-year-old mare was making a move toward the lead on the 
backstretch when she faltered and drifted back to last. 
</P>
<P>
	When Moni Maker returned to the paddock, she was in distress,  
requiring the intervention by Dr. Janet Durso, a veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
	Moni Maker, who won 12 of 17 starts last year and earned $1.23  
million, was sent to the University of Pennsylvania's New Bolton 
Center for tests over the weekend. The mare was returned to Joie de 
Vie Farm in Jobstown. 
</P>
<P>
	``As best as I can understand it, some sort of virus might have  
caused it,'' Svensson said. ``She was exposed to a lot with all her 
traveling and being in quarantine barns. But there is no damage to 
her heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No decision has been made on whether the mare will race again,  
Svensson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moni Maker won the Nat Ray and the Breeders Crown last year and  
several major stakes in Europe. She has career earnings of $3.67 
million.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Slips, Tokyo Stocks Edge Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen today as Japanese  
life insurers and exporters sold the U.S. currency in the absence 
of intervention by the Bank of Japan. Japanese stocks inched up. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.91 yen, down 0.43 yen from late Monday in  
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 122.42 yen 
overnight. The currency traded between 121.79 yen and 122.50 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 38.77 points,  
or 0.22 percent, ending the day at 17,777.62. On Monday, the 
average closed up 307.59 points, or 1.76 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped as players nudged the  
U.S. currency down to see how low the Bank of Japan will let it go, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Bank of Japan intervened several times to buy  
dollars and sell yen to stem the Japanese currency's rise. It was 
the fourth action by Japan's central bank in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recent fast rise in the yen is due to excessive hopes for  
a Japanese economic recovery. I think the rise is disruptive to the 
market, and the purpose of recent interventions was to preempt such 
moves,'' Japan's Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said at a regular 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the market is far from bullish on the dollar.  
</P>
<P>
	``Other than short-term interbank speculators hoping for  
intervention, there are really no dollar buyers,'' said Takeo 
Suzuki, assistant foreign exchange manager at Nomura Trust and 
Banking. 
</P>
<P>
	Although recent government data indicate signs of improvement in  
Japan's economy, the nation is still struggling to overcome its 
worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's repeated interventions are seen as an attempt  
to ensure that the nascent recovery is not torpedoed by the yen's 
sudden surge. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.94 yen, down  
from 126.66 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices rose early in the day as investors  
bought high technology shares and blue chip exporters. But stocks 
fell as the day went on and the market traded mostly lower before 
rising on buying by foreign investors, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 6.59 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,425.64. The 
TOPIX rose 22.76 points, or 1.63 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines by 606 to 597,  
with 116 issues unchanged. Volume on the first section was 
estimated at 612.57 million shares, up from Monday's 546.19 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.6950 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7500 percent, 
driving its price up to 97.47 yen from 97.02 yen.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Fall On Weather News / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices sank Tuesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade on forecasts for weather that appeared 
favorable for growing and harvesting crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by forecasts for clear, dry weather  
in coming days that could get harvesting back on track in winter 
wheat-growing areas. The forecast reversed early support from rains 
that were falling in some Plains growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans and corn retreated amid expectations rains across the  
Midwest will prove beneficial to crop development. Agronomists also 
noted that hot weather could have little effect on the hardier 
soybean plants, and higher temperatures were not expected to reduce 
corn yields at this point in the growing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 4 1/2 cents to $2.50 1/4 a bushel; July  
corn fell 3 cents to $2.16 1/4 a bushel; July oats fell 2 1/4 cents to 
$1.13 a bushel; July soybeans fell 3 3/4 cents to $4.67 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose 0.18 cent to 63.70 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose 0.27 cent to 77.17 cents a pound; July lean hogs 
rose 0.82 cent to 51.82 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose 0.52 
cent to 44.32 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> David Gillooly Faces Arraignment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ARTHUR, Texas (AP) -- Nobody questions David Gillooly's  
ability as a charity fundraiser. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, his former employers are quick to praise him for  
bringing in dollars for the needy. This year, Vice President Al 
Gore called a Savannah, Ga., shelter program for men with AIDS that 
Gillooly started one of the nation's most innovative. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gets a lot of credit for that happening,'' said the Rev.  
Micheal Elliott, Union Mission's president. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Gillooly was boosting charity coffers, authorities and  
charity officials in at least four states say he also was putting 
money into his own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Gillooly was arrested in Kentucky, just over a month  
after he disappeared from his job as the executive director of Port 
Cities Rescue Mission from this Gulf Coast town. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillooly is suspected of taking as much as $120,000 of the  
homeless shelter's funds. He was scheduled to face arraignment 
today in Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one ever suspected there was something amiss financially,''  
Port Cities board president Jeff Branick said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one suspected him, of course, until it was too late.  
</P>
<P>
	For three years, Gillooly thrilled Port Cities' board members  
with his energy and fund-raising acumen that made the shelter one 
of the area's more successful charities. 
</P>
<P>
	But after Gillooly disappeared on May 13 while on an apparent  
fund-raising mission in Austin, the board discovered both messy 
bookkeeping and that he was wanted for violating the parole terms 
for a conviction for stealing from a charity in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Past associates and family members have told The Associated  
Press that Gillooly has fleeced charitable causes in two other 
states: Georgia and Florida. He has not been charged in those 
alleged incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillooly first surfaced in the charity world during the late  
1980s, when he developed Union Mission's AIDS shelter program in 
Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	However, when Gillooly took a job in Norfolk, Va., in 1992 as  
executive director of Tidewater AIDS Taskforce, $5,000 in Union 
Mission funds came up missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Gillooly acknowledged the theft and reimbursed the  
shelter, Elliott said he dropped the matter, but Tidewater AIDS was 
never informed of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	After about a year in Virginia, Gillooly disappeared and  
officials uncovered $9,779.09 missing via checks forged by 
Gillooly, said James Spivey, Tidewater AIDS' current executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did an excellent job as executive director, except for the  
money,'' Spivey said. ``He can cause you to lower your guard a 
little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Virginia, Gillooly headed to Christ Is The Answer Rescue  
Mission in Melbourne, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in the front door of the mission like everybody else:  
needy,'' recalled mission president Danny Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillooly was put to work in the shelter's thrift store, handling  
about $1,300 a day as manager and eventually married a woman from 
an area church on June 11, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the kindest, sweetest guy you would have ever met. A  
real romantic,'' the former Donna Gillooly told the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	When she became pregnant, Mrs. Gillooly discovered her husband  
was a wanted man. In June 1995, U.S. Customs arrested Gillooly on 
Tidewater-related forgery warrants as the couple returned to 
Florida from a cruise. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillooly persuaded his wife that former business associates were  
making him a scapegoat and that the best way out was to plead 
guilty, take a suspended 10-year prison sentence and repay 
Tidewater. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father loaned Gillooly $6,000 for the restitution. He began  
paying the amount he owed but failed to reimburse his father-in-law 
as stipulated in his sentence. Eventually, in 1996, Mrs. Gillooly 
fled with her son. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Florida mission eventually discovered they,  
too, had lost money. But because Gillooly had controlled the 
accounting, they couldn't be sure how much was missing and didn't 
file charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was robbing us ... not blind, but he was doing a pretty  
good job at it,'' Ellison said. Gillooly was fired on March 22, 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida charity's losses were still being counted when  
Gillooly was able to land the Port Arthur job on the recommendation 
of a former co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
	``His pattern is, once he achieves success, he sabotages himself  
and the agency,'' said Elliott, of Union Mission. ``That is 
something clinical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many non-profits lack the budget and time to thoroughly  
investigate every job candidate, a cursory check might have raised 
flags. 
</P>
<P>
	On a resume provided to the AP by his ex-wife, Gillooly claims  
to have a bachelor's degree in business administration from the 
University of Texas at Austin. The university says no academic 
degree was ever awarded to a David Gillooly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad part, the part that really hurts, is we deal with  
clients that usually nobody wants to deal with,'' said Tidewater 
AIDS' Spivey. ``So when you can get someone coming in, and they 
gain your trust and you relinquish it, not only do they walk off 
with your money, they walk out with your heart and your soul.''

<HEADLINE> Ohio St Asst FB Coach Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio State assistant football coach Mike  
Jacobs pleaded guilty Tuesday to a charge of disorderly conduct to 
resolve accusations that he struck his ex-wife during a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Steven Hayes of Franklin County Municipal Court placed  
Jacobs on probation for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	He also ordered Jacobs to spend 30 days in jail, but 28 days  
were suspended. Jacobs had been given credit for spending two days 
in jail after the charges were filed Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	As a condition of his probation, he must receive domestic  
violence counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs had been charged with assault and domestic violence, but  
Hayes dismissed the assault charge and the domestic violence charge 
was changed to disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbin Jacobs accused her ex-husband of hitting her and pulling  
her hair while the two were driving on a freeway. Jacobs had denied 
doing anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple have four children. They were married June 18, 1987,  
and divorced July 23, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, a fourth year assistant under coach John Cooper, was  
placed on paid administrative leave after the charges were filed 
but later was reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs remains as the team's offensive coordinator, Andy Geiger,  
Ohio State's athletics director, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs was an assistant for 15 years at West Virginia before  
coming to Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge is the son of the late Ohio State coach Woody Hayes.

<HEADLINE> Suit Filed Over Fla. School Vouchers </HEADLINE>

	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Opponents of Florida's statewide school  
voucher program filed a lawsuit Tuesday, saying it is 
unconstitutional and will destroy public education while breaking 
down the wall between church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	The law creating the vouchers, signed a day earlier by Gov. Jeb  
Bush, allows parents to send their children to private or parochial 
schools at taxpayer expense. It is the only statewide voucher 
program in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Students in failing schools can choose to go to private school  
with the tax dollars that would otherwise go to the public school. 
Students at just two schools, both in Pensacola, would initially be 
eligible for vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Watson, a parent with three students in Escambia County  
schools, which includes Pensacola, said he is worried that the 
entire school system will deteriorate if money is drained out 
because of just two failing schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just simply doesn't make sense,'' Watson said.  
</P>
<P>
	The state lawsuit alleges the law violates the First Amendment  
of the U.S. Constitution, which requires the separation of church 
and state, and the Florida Constitution, which forbids spending 
state money in support of any church or religious institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush repeated his belief that the state is on ``strong legal  
ground.'' His attorney, Carol Licko, said every issue raised by the 
opponents ``rings hollow'' and predicted Florida's courts would 
follow the lead of courts in Wisconsin and Ohio, which have said 
voucher programs don't violate separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	Voucher opponents, who have organized as the Florida Coalition  
for Public Schools, include teacher unions, religious groups and 
the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida.

<HEADLINE> Air France Plans Delta Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French national carrier Air France is forming a  
partnership with Delta Air Lines as a first step toward building a 
worldwide alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The two airlines said Tuesday they plan to ``align their  
commercial policies'' and that cooperation will include cargo as 
well as passenger service. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France said it would announce a ``major global alliance'' by  
the end of the year that would include other airlines from among 
Air France and Delta's existing partners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta and Air France together have begun the process of  
creating a multi-carrier alliance that will offer both great 
service and an unsurpassed route network providing access to the 
markets our customers seek most,'' Air France Chairman Jean-Cyril 
Spinetta said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France had said it was in talks with Delta and Continental  
Airlines for the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The French airline already has code sharing agreements with both  
the U.S. carriers. Under a code-sharing arrangement, airlines share 
flight numbers, meaning passengers who book flights with one 
airline may actually fly on a partner airline's jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta, which is based in Atlanta, said the alliance will allow  
it to grow within the European market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Airline customers today must be able to travel or ship cargo  
from anywhere in the world to everywhere else, but no one airline 
can meet this demand alone,'' Delta Chairman Leo F. Mullin said in 
the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air France-Delta alliance comes as competition mounts on  
U.S.-European routes. Continental announced last month that it 
plans to expand operations in Europe and eventually join Northwest 
Airlines' alliance with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Alitalia.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines and the French national carrier  
Air France plan to align their cargo and passenger services as part 
of a long-term deal to form a major global alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the alliance, which will include other airlines, are  
still in the works and are expected to be final by the end of the 
year. But Delta indicated Tuesday it expects profitable benefits 
from its links with Air France's cargo capabilities, besides 
increased passenger cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means growth for both airlines,'' Delta spokeswoman Kay  
Horner said. She said the long-term agreement will lead to 
coordinated marketing and cooperation in other areas, including 
flying passengers and moving cargo. The two carriers already have a 
code-sharing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based Delta serves 230 cities in 29 countries, while  
Air France has 174 destinations in 85 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Airline customers today must be able to travel or ship cargo  
from anywhere in the world to everywhere else, but no one airline 
can meet this demand alone,'' said Leo F. Mullin, Delta's chairman 
and chief executive officer. ``The alliance we are in the process 
of forming will be the means for world airlines to accomplish 
together what no one of us is able to accomplish single-handedly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta and Air France together have begun the process of  
creating a multi-carrier alliance that will offer both great 
service and an unsurpassed route network,'' Air France chairman 
Jean-Cyril Spinetta said. ``While our carriers are the cornerstones 
in Europe and North America for the worldwide alliance to come, we 
are already exploring opportunities with other founding partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air France is among a dozen international carriers with which  
Delta has a code-sharing arrangement. Airlines with such agreements 
share flight numbers, meaning passengers who book flights with one 
airline may actually fly on a partner airline's jet. 
</P>
<P>
	The increasingly popular arrangements allow U.S. airlines to  
extend their route networks for their fliers by offering seamless 
travel connections. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air France-Delta alliance comes as competition mounts on  
U.S.-European routes. Continental announced last month that it 
plans to expand operations in Europe and eventually join Northwest 
Airlines' alliance with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Alitalia. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, American Airlines on Tuesday reached a marketing  
alliance with Swissair, Swiss Air Transport Co. and Sabena Belgian 
World Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp., parent company of Fort Worth, Texas-based American,  
said the airlines will share some trans-Atlantic routes as soon as 
possible after obtaining all necessary governmental approvals. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR has code-sharing agreements with 19 airlines, including  
Canadian Airlines and Japan Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta also has code-sharing agreements with Swissair and Sabena.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'My Son the Fanatic' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Not everyone will enjoy ``My Son the Fanatic.''  
</P>
<P>
	It is dark. It is an art film. And the subject matter concerns  
the relationship between a Pakistani cab driver and an English 
prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	But the film is worth trying. It is a complex, fascinating look  
at what happens when vastly different cultures and social strata 
collide. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanif Kureishi, who wrote the fresh, funny ``My Beautiful  
Laundrette,'' adapted ``My Son the Fanatic'' for the screen from 
his novel. Like ``Laundrette'' in 1985, this film examines how 
Pakistanis adapt to Western culture. The results are sometimes 
amusing, sometimes frightening. 
</P>
<P>
	Parvez (Om Puri) has driven a cab in Northern England for 25  
years. It's not a particularly exciting job, but he does it to 
support his wife, Minoo (Gopi Desai), and teen-age son, Farid 
(Akbar Kurtha). 
</P>
<P>
	He's not nearly as successful as his childhood friend, Fizzy,  
who owns a trendy restaurant and nightclub. This is a point Minoo 
makes repeatedly to Parvez, even as she rubs his feet after 14 
hours on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Minoo is demanding and aloof, and she incessantly criticizes  
Parvez. When Parvez tries to find his son an English bride of high 
social standing, Farid rejects his efforts in favor of friends of 
his own culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Parvez withdraws from his family and finds an unusual soulmate  
in Bettina (Rachel Griffiths in a blond wig), a prostitute he 
drives from job to job. After both are done with work, they take 
long walks at dawn and talk in ways he and his wife never do. 
</P>
<P>
	Their friendship slowly, tenderly turns into love. That's where  
the trouble begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Parvez, in his desire to become Anglicized, falls deep into the  
seedy side of English society with Bettina and a group of 
prostitutes, led by a brash, coke-snorting German businessman 
(Stellan Skarsgard). 
</P>
<P>
	Farid rebels against his father's new lifestyle and becomes the  
``fanatic'' of the film's title. He follows fundamentalist Islamic 
tenets until they drive him to violence in some of the movie's most 
disturbing scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our cultures -- they cannot be mixed!'' Farid shouts at his  
father one night over dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	In tackling the racial conflicts the characters face, the film  
doesn't preach, and that makes its message stronger. Kurieshi lets 
the situations reveal themselves, and allows us to judge for 
ourselves who's right and who's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	As Parvez, Puri gives a thought-provoking, multilayered  
performance. He has compassion and love for his son, even as Farid 
walks out of his life for good. Despite the compromising situations 
Parvez gets into, we cheer for him to succeed and find happiness, 
even with a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffiths shows tenderness and warmth as Bettina, a woman whose  
lifestyle should have squelched such emotions long ago. The love 
scenes between Bettina and Parvez are sensuous and intimate. He is 
not a traditionally attractive man, and he's at least 20 years 
older than Bettina, but she finds a beauty in him that is stirring. 
</P>
<P>
	Skarsgard is hard to watch because his character is so  
obnoxious, and yet you cannot turn your eyes away. He is completely 
unpredictable and injects life into Parvez's quiet, dreary 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
	Udayan Prasad's edgy direction and disjointed imagery add to the  
film's tension. The cab scenes shift from the rearview mirror, to a 
rainy windshield with wipers whipping across it, to fleeting shots 
of hookers and neon lights as the cab cruises past them. 
</P>
<P>
	``My Son the Fanatic'' is derivative at times. A scene in which  
a john paws Bettina in the back of Parvez's cab is straight out of 
``Taxi Driver.'' The character of a prostitute who can be redeemed 
is in no way original. 
</P>
<P>
	But we care about the characters because they are capable of  
kindness and anger, loyalty and prejudice at the same time. Through 
them, the film presents a welcome reality -- human beings are flawed 
and contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
	``My Son the Fanatic,'' a Miramax Films release, is rated R for  
language, nudity and violence. It runs 81 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Court Aids Discrimination Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court made it somewhat easier  
Tuesday for victims of job discrimination to force their employer 
to pay extra damages as punishment, a decision advocates for both 
employers and employees found reason to praise. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruling 7-2 in the case of a woman denied a promotion because of  
her sex, the court said job-bias victims can collect so-called 
punitive damages without having to show their employer's conduct 
was ``egregious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But by a separate 5-4 vote in the same case, the justices said  
employers cannot be forced to pay such damages if a manager's 
discriminatory conduct runs counter to the employer's good-faith 
efforts to run a bias-free workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good decision for employers, in particular the part  
... that says employers' anti-discrimination policies should be 
taken into account,'' said Robert E. Williams of the Equal 
Employment Advisory Council, an association of about 300 large 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for  
Women, said the ruling means that if employers ``know or should 
know that they've violated the law in discriminating against you, 
then they can be hit up for punitives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the part of the ruling that protects employers with  
anti-bias policies, she added, ``If they take all those steps in 
good faith ... isn't that what we want?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jeffrey L. Needle of the Association of Trial Lawyers of  
America said he was concerned that some courts may free companies 
from having to pay punitive damages even if their anti-bias 
policies are inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was the availability of damage awards intended to  
punish or deter misconduct. A federal appeals court said such 
awards are never available unless an employee can prove the 
employer's conduct was egregious. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Supreme Court ruled that standard is too high and is not  
required by a federal anti-bias law known as Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, which bars employment discrimination based on 
race, sex, national origin and religion. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1991, the law has allowed victims of intentional  
discrimination to collect up to $300,000 in punitive damages if 
they show their employer acted with ``malice or with reckless 
indifference'' to their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of rulings last year, the court made it easier to win  
sex-harassment lawsuits and compensatory damages against employers. 
It said employers can always be held responsible for harassment, a 
form of discrimination, that results in tangible professional 
injury such as firing or demotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's decision ordered a federal appeals court to restudy  
the case of Carole Kolstad, who is seeking punitive damages from 
the Chicago-based American Dental Association for failing to 
promote her because of her sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Kolstad was the association's director of federal agency  
relations in Washington when the director of legislation announced 
his retirement in 1992. A male co-worker got the job and Kolstad 
sued, saying he was chosen because of sex bias against her. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said a supervisor told sexually offensive jokes at  
staff meetings and described professionally prominent women in 
sexually derogatory terms. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal court jury ruled Kolstad was the victim of  
discrimination and awarded her $52,718 in back pay. The trial judge 
refused to let the jury consider punitive damages and the full U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia agreed, 
saying she did not show her employer's conduct was egregious. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor wrote that the law ``does not require a showing of  
egregious or outrageous discrimination independent of the 
employer's state of mind.'' Instead, she said, someone seeking 
punitive damages must show the employer knew the actions might 
violate federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	That part of her opinion was joined by Justices John Paul  
Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas dissented. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor also wrote that well-meaning employers need not pay  
punitive damages for a manager's misconduct when it is ``contrary 
to the employer's good-faith efforts'' to comply with the law, an 
issue hardly mentioned when the case was argued before the justices 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist, Thomas, Scalia and Kennedy joined that part of the  
ruling. Rehnquist said it puts ``a significant limitation, and in 
many foreseeable cases a complete bar, on employer liability for 
punitive damages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer dissented from that  
section. Stevens said the court should not have decided that issue.

<HEADLINE> Many Choices in Muni Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Whenever they get into a wrestling match with  
the tax rules covering mutual funds, the thought strikes some 
investors that the time has come to consider municipal bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Munis once were regarded as the province of the wealthy few. But  
in today's economy, they have a much broader appeal to anyone 
interested in the tax-free income these bonds provide. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when municipal yields run above 90 percent of what you  
can get on taxable U.S. government bonds, they can make sense for 
anyone among the millions of middle- to upper-middle-income 
investors faced with a marginal federal income tax rate of 28 
percent or more. 
</P>
<P>
	But the decision isn't as simple as the basic math may make it  
appear. Once you have decided that a packaged muni investment fits 
your needs, you still must determine whether an open-ended muni 
fund will work better for you than a closed-end muni fund, with a 
fixed number of shares traded in the secondary market, or a muni 
unit trust sold by one of several brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Got it narrowed down to open-ended funds? Then you need only  
pick one or two of them from a field of more than 1,800 different 
funds: National, single-state, long-term, intermediate-term, 
short-term, insured or non-insured, high-yield or high-quality. 
</P>
<P>
	To some degree, the choice must depend on your individual  
circumstances. But there are some general guidelines that can be 
used to simplify the process. 
</P>
<P>
	National funds offer you the advantage of geographical  
diversification, which protects you should regional or local 
troubles depress the bonds of any given state or local government. 
That sort of thing has happened within recent decades in places as 
far apart as New York City and Orange County, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	If you live in a high-tax state, though, a single-state fund may  
offer you a significant yield advantage by sparing you state and 
local taxes as well as a federal income tax burden. 
</P>
<P>
	``Choose a single-state fund if you live in a high-tax state,''  
suggests Steve Chung, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in the firm's 
monthly newsletter Morningstar FundInvestor. ``Otherwise, go 
national.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quality and maturity choices depend on how aggressive you want  
to be. A high-yield muni fund may offer you a better income payoff, 
if you are willing to bet that a diversified portfolio provides 
sufficient armor against the risk of defaults on individual bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, a long-term fund may hold the prospect of a better  
return, if you are willing to brave its greater exposure to 
fluctuations in interest rates, compared with short-term or 
intermediate-term funds. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what your preferences on these variables, advisers  
recommend that all investors pay attention to a fund's expenses. 
``Costs are important for all bond funds, but especially for muni 
offerings,'' Chung says. 
</P>
<P>
	``In any given year, the difference between the highest- and  
lowest-returning muni funds can be just a few percentage points. A 
small cost advantage goes a long way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adds Jonathan Pond, a financial-planning expert in Watertown,  
Ma.: ``Fund expenses do matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An extra wrinkle of muni investing concerns the alternative  
minimum tax, which can wind up pinning some investors with a tax 
liability on ``tax-free'' income. Some muni funds expressly avoid 
bonds that are subject to the AMT. 
</P>
<P>
	``A once-in-a-decade opportunity for municipal bond investors  
occurred late last year when municipal bond yields equaled Treasury 
bond yields,'' Pond observes in his Quarterly Investment Review 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually, muni yields are somewhere around 80 percent of the  
equivalent maturity Treasury bond yield to account for the muni's 
federal tax-free status. While the yield gap has widened over the 
past several months, opportunities still exist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Municipal bonds continue to be attractive for those few of us  
left who still think there's a place for bonds in a portfolio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Says Chung at Morningstar, ``If municipal bonds aren't the  
biggest bargain in the markets today, they're close.''

<HEADLINE> Tampa To Host Junior Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Junior Pan American Games scheduled for  
next month will be held in Tampa after Miami rejected the 
international teen-age track and field competition because of 
Cuban-American opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of Florida 2012, a nonprofit group trying to bring the  
2012 Summer Olympics to the Tampa Bay area, said Tuesday they will 
help USA Track and Field host the three-day event. 
</P>
<P>
	The championships are scheduled for July 9-11, giving Tampa  
sponsors less than three weeks to plan for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The games, to be held at the University of South Florida, are  
expected to bring at least 350 young athletes from 35 countries to 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban-Americans in the Miami area were upset Cuban athletes were  
invited to participate. Now Cuban groups in Tampa are also angered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let Cuba compete when it is free, democratic, sovereign and  
human rights are restored,'' said Osberto Fernandez, president of 
the Tampa Cuban Exile Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has until June 25 to decide whether to participate.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are involved in the same fight against (Cuban President  
Fidel) Castro as Miami Cubans,'' said Oscar Rodriguez, president of 
Casa Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cuban-American attorney Pedro G. Velez Jr., sees the  
situation differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is there are many Cubans in this city and the  
state who believe that there should be normalized political and 
economical relations between the United States and Cuba,'' Velez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The international competition will be held simultaneously with  
the Sunshine State Games, an amateur Florida event that is expected 
to bring up to 1,000 young athletes to USF July 8-10.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Governor's Conviction Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court overturned the bank  
fraud convictions of former Arizona Gov. Fife Symington today, 
saying the trial judge wrongly dismissed a juror during 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2-1 ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said  
there was a ``reasonable possibility'' that the juror was removed 
because she disagreed with other jurors about Symington's guilt, 
and not because she failed to take part in the deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling entitles Symington, 53, to a new trial. He was  
sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison but has remained free during his 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole family and I are just thrilled,'' Symington told  
KFYI radio in Phoenix. ``I don't know what the future holds, but 
today is a good day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor was convicted of lying in financial  
statements to lenders during his career as a real estate developer, 
before he was elected governor. He resigned from office right after 
he was convicted in September 1997, when he was in his second term 
as governor. State law would have forced him out of office anyway 
when he was sentenced that November. 
</P>
<P>
	Six days into deliberations, U.S. District Judge Roger Strand  
had dismissed juror Mary Ann Cotey and replaced her with an 
alternate. 
</P>
<P>
	Other jurors had complained that Ms. Cotey, 74, was inattentive  
and confused, didn't seem to understand some of the evidence and 
wouldn't explain her positions. After interviewing Ms. Cotey, 
Strand found that she was ``either unable or unwilling to 
deliberate with her colleagues,'' a permissible ground for removal 
under the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cotey said later she would have voted to acquit and said  
fellow jurors forced her off the panel because they wanted to 
convict Symington. In media interviews, Ms. Cotey had also 
suggested jurors were engaging in vote trading, which is against 
the rules, and alleged some members had discussed Symington's 
income taxes -- a subject they were told to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said a judge cannot dismiss a juror if there  
is a reasonable possibility that the reason stems from the juror's 
views. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the judge must either order more deliberations or  
declare a mistrial, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there may have been some reason to doubt Cotey's  
abilities as a juror, there was also considerable evidence to 
suggest that the other jurors' frustrations with her derived 
primarily from the fact that she held a position opposite to theirs 
on the merits of the case,'' said the opinion by Judge Betty 
Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
	She quoted one juror as urging Strand to dismiss Ms. Cotey  
because otherwise the jury would be deadlocked. Ms. Cotey herself 
said she thought the other jurors were frustrated with her because 
``I can't agree with the majority all the time, at least 
temporarily,'' Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just ganged up on her. That was wrong and we righted that  
wrong,'' said Symington's attorney, John Dowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge A. Wallace Tashima joined her opinion. U.S. District Judge  
James Fitzgerald of Alaska, temporarily assigned to the appeals 
court, said in dissent that there was overwhelming evidence to 
support Strand's conclusion that Ms. Cotey was failing to take part 
in deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged Symington gave false personal financial  
statements to lenders to get millions of dollars in loans to fund 
his failing projects in the 1980s and early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Symington contended his inflated net worth and other mistakes in  
the documents were unintentional and should have been caught by his 
accountants. 
</P>
<P>
	Symington, a scion of bluebood wealth and Eastern establishment,  
declared personal bankruptcy in 1995, listing about $25 million in 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of union pension funds that loaned Symington $10 million  
for his failed Mercado project is suing him in federal bankruptcy 
court, but no trial date has been set.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Seems Like Men's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	How predictable is the Women's World Cup? The Brazilians dance  
past opponents, the Germans play rugged soccer and the Nigerians 
attack all game. Not much different from the men. 
</P>
<P>
	Except, of course, that the United States, China and Norway are  
the big, uh, guys in this event. They're generally weak links in 
the men's game. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest offensive onslaught, not surprisingly, came from  
Brazil, which routed Mexico 7-1 in the nightcap of the opening 
doubleheader. While the women don't build their attack quite as 
crisply as the Brazilian men, they finish just as well. And they 
celebrate with a samba to the sidelines to slap hands with the 
reserves and the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are Brazilian, so we try to play the beautiful game that  
people expect from Brazil,'' coach Wilson de Oliveira said. ``We 
want to win, but we also want to entertain, to show a flair for 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Pretinha, they have a forward as flamboyant as Romario or any  
of her countrymen. The diminutive (5-foot-2) speedster constantly 
beat Mexican defenders to free balls, and once she took control, 
Pretinha usually created a scoring chance. 
</P>
<P>
	After she and teammate Sissi each scored a hat trick, Pretinha  
said with a laugh that she got her third goal, in the final 
moments, because she was jealous of Sissi. 
</P>
<P>
	Although their legion of followers wasn't nearly as numerous as  
the groups following the Brazilian men, the women's fans were just 
as entertaining. Beating their bongos to the samba rhythms, 
Brazil's fans didn't need any invitation to celebrate. Still, their 
heroines gave them seven good reasons to dance and sing. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria wasn't quite as prolific, beating North Korea just 2-1.  
But their surpassing skills with the ball and their willingness to 
exhibit them -- why make a pass when three sensational ball fakes 
will get them to the same place? -- were enchanting against the 
befuddled Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe in attacking football,'' coach Ismaila Mabo said,  
``and we will always play that way. We don't care who we play. If 
we play the Brazilian male team, if we play the American male team, 
we would play exactly the same. We don't believe in negative 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Falcons next play the American women, whose defense  
will be tested by Mercy Akide and Florence Omagbemi. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're so committed to the attack,'' said Lauren Gregg, the  
assistant coach of the U.S. team who was in Pasadena for the 
Nigeria-North Korea game. ``They're running at the same pace in the 
90th minute as they were at the beginning of the game. And Akide is 
an international personality, someone who can take over a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Germany never was able to take over its game with Italy, which  
finished 1-1. Although the Germans wore down the Italians with hard 
tackling and aggressive play in the air, their marksmanship was 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar style in games with Mexico and Brazil could be  
effective. The Mexicans are inexperienced and not used to playing 
such forceful teams. The Brazilians will outrun Germany, so 
physical aggression likely will remain in Germany's game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the three favorites, the Chinese had the most difficult time  
in their opener. They also sustained some injuries in beating 
Sweden 2-1; China's top player, Weng Sun, hurt her leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway had a huge edge in possession time and shots against  
outmanned Russia. But they were sloppy and won only 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans, playing before the largest crowd for a women's  
sporting event in U.S. history, started slowly, then dominated 
Denmark in a 3-0 win. 
</P>
<P>
	Victories in their next game, however, will advance the United  
States or Nigeria, China, Norway and Brazil.

<HEADLINE>  It's Twin Towers vs. Twin Terrors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If San Antonio has Twin Towers in David Robinson  
and Tim Duncan, then New York has Twin Terrors in Latrell Sprewell 
and Allan Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Me and Allan can pressure defenses,'' Sprewell said.  
</P>
<P>
	That they do.  
</P>
<P>
	Houston (34) and Sprewell (24) combined for 58 points in the  
Knicks' 89-81 Game 2 victory that left New York trailing the 
best-of-7 series 2-1. They are the only Knicks averaging in double 
figures in the series, Houston at 24 points a game and Sprewell at 
23. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of their success has been getting the ball in the  
right place at the right time. Houston was able to do that 
repeatedly in Game 2, nailing midrange jump shots to keep the 
Knicks in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 15-to-20 footer has always been my strength,'' he said.  
``Shooting off the dribble, it's kind of paying off. The way the 
game is played now, that shot can be very effective. The great 
scorers, Walt Frazier, Earl Monroe, Oscar Robertson lived off that 
midrange shot. It's something I can be successful with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, on the other hand, darts and drives to the basket, and  
is more effective in the open court transition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they pose problems for defenses, especially on those  
occasions when Sprewell plays point guard alongside Houston in the 
backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we go big in the backcourt, we can force them to double,''  
Sprewell said. 
</P>
<P>
	As effective as Sprewell's open court game has been, the Knicks'  
success more and more often revolves around Houston, especially 
with leading scorer Patrick Ewing sidelined because of a torn 
Achilles' tendon. Since Ewing went out after the second game of the 
Eastern Conference finals, Houston has become New York's No. 1 
scoring option. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a good feel for the game in the sense of assessing  
spatial relationship with the defender,'' Spurs coach Gregg 
Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson put Houston's success in less mathematical terms.  
</P>
<P>
	``He seems very relaxed out there, just having fun,'' he said.  
``He was making tough shots and looked like he felt good. When a 
guy gets in that place, it's very dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston hopes so.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to be consistent,'' he said. ``I don't want to  
score 30 points one night and 10 the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consistency has sometimes been missing from Sprewell's game.  
Scoreless in the third quarter of Game 3, he had 10 points in the 
fourth. After hitting 10 straight free throws in Game 2, he missed 
four of five attempts during one key stretch in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, both players were key elements of the victory.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy sees an approach in Houston that was not  
there in his first two seasons in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``His hunger is different now,'' Van Gundy said. ``He was  
content before to score his 20 points. Now, he has a continuing 
hunger to score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston confirmed his coach's assessment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's right,'' he said. ``Look at the great scorers.  
They're not happy with 20. If they have a great start, they want to 
keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early on, I was a little unselfish. I found there was a way to  
do both. It hasn't happened overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston said his evolution was natural. He was signed to a $54  
million free agent contract as a scorer and now he scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our job, to put the ball in the basket,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Then he thought about the name of his position -- shooting guard.  
</P>
<P>
	``The first part of the position is `shooting,''' he said.  
``That's what we do best.''

<HEADLINE> Court Limits Disabilities Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today limited the reach of a  
federal ban on discrimination against the disabled, ruling the law 
generally does not protect people with poor eyesight or other 
conditions that can be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
	Protections of the Americans with Disabilities Act usually are  
restricted to people whose conditions are not readily corrected 
with medication or devices such as eyeglasses, the justices said in 
three rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before today's decisions, employers had won the vast  
majority of lawsuits resolved in court under the ADA, a 1990 law 
best known for requiring handicap access ramps in public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate ruling that also centered on the ADA law, the high  
court held 6-3 that states may have to place people with mental 
disabilities in homelike settings if they can fare just as well 
there as in state hospitals. In the narrow, middle-of-the-road 
ruling, the court in a Georgia case said the ADA law requires such 
community placement of the mentally disabled whenever appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We confront the question whether the proscription of  
discrimination may require placement of persons with mental 
disabilities in community settings, rather than in institutions,'' 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. ``The answer, we 
hold, is a qualified yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an unrelated case, the court, on a 7-2 vote, made it slightly  
easier for victims of on-the-job discrimination to force their 
employers to pay extra monetary damages as punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The rulings limiting application of ADA's protections bar  
lawsuits by two nearsighted pilots, a truck driver almost blind in 
one eye and a mechanic with high blood pressure who were either 
fired or denied employment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hold that determination of whether an individual is  
disabled should be made with reference to measures that mitigate 
the individual's impairment, including, in this instance, 
eyeglasses and contact lenses,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote 
in the case of the two nearsighted pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also ruled that the two women, as well as the mechanic  
with high blood pressure, were not entitled to coverage under a 
provision of the law protecting people who are ``regarded as'' 
having a disability. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled 7-2 in those two cases, while the justices ruled  
unanimously against the truck driver who is almost blind in one 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
	A disability-rights group called the three decisions a  
``profound setback.'' The Center for an Accessible Society said the 
court's interpretation of the law ``erroneously turns the act into 
a benefits law under which only a select group of Americans can 
qualify.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against a  
``qualified individual with a disability'' because of that 
disability. 
</P>
<P>
	A qualified person is defined as one who can perform a job when  
given reasonable accommodation, and a disability is a condition 
that substantially limits a major life activity. The ADA also 
protects people who are ``regarded as'' having a disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers have fared well in ADA court battles. They won 92  
percent of the 700 ADA cases resolved in court from 1992 to 1997, 
according to the American Bar Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts had split over how far the law's protections extend  
in today's cases, from Colorado, Oregon and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	In her opinion, Ginsburg said states may have to opt for  
community-based treatment ``when the state's treatment 
professionals have determined that community placement is 
appropriate, the transfer from institutional care to a less 
restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual, and 
the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account 
the resources available to the state and the needs of others with 
mental disabilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the decision limiting coverage of the ADA, O'Connor noted the  
law stated that 43 million Americans were disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had Congress intended to include all persons with corrected  
physical limitations among those covered by the act, it undoubtedly 
would have cited a much higher number of disabled persons in the 
findings,'' she said. ``That it did not is evidence that the ADA's 
coverage is restricted to only those whose impairments are not 
mitigated by corrective measures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her opinions in the cases involving the pilots and the mechanic  
were joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices 
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence 
Thomas and Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice John Paul Stevens and Stephen G. Breyer dissented.  
Writing for the two in the pilots' case, Stevens said the court 
should give the ADA ``a generous, rather than a miserly, 
construction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Colorado case, twin sisters who want to be pilots for  
United Air Lines were rejected because of their extreme 
nearsightedness. Lower courts ruled that Karen Sutton and Kimberly 
Hinton were not considered disabled under the ADA because their 
poor eyesight is fully correctable with glasses or contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	During arguments in the case last April, a Justice Department  
lawyer supported the two women, saying United tried to have it both 
ways by saying they were not disabled because their vision could be 
corrected, but refusing to hire them because of their poor vision.

<HEADLINE> Congress Wants Energy Dept. Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A call for a radical overhaul of the Energy  
Department gained momentum in Congress today as Republican and 
Democratic senators agreed ``fundamental changes'' are needed in 
the management of the nation's nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
	And Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, while continuing to resist  
creation of a largely independent nuclear weapons agency within his 
department said he agreed ``more needs to be done'' to improve 
security at weapons labs and that he might support some department 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nuclear weapons complex needs to be rescued from the  
Energy Department'' Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said at an usual 
hearing of four Senate committees. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing focused on a report by the president's intelligence  
advisory board, released last week, that said security problems in 
the weapons programs, including the labs, cannot be resolved short 
of creation of a semi-autonomous nuclear agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Summarizing the report for the senators, former New Hampshire  
Sen. Warren Rudman, the advisory board's chairman said the Energy 
Department ``is badly broken and it's long past time for half 
measures'' to ensure nuclear weapons security. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, who testified along with Rudman, said he was ready  
to accept 90 percent of the Rudman panel's recommendations, but he 
still opposes creation of ``a bureaucratic Berlin Wall'' that would 
separate the weapons program from the rest of the Energy 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	He said this would reduce the energy secretary's future  
authority. 
</P>
<P>
	But some sort of restructuring appeared to be virtually  
inevitable as both Democrats and Republicans said ``Band-Aid 
approaches'' will not do the job of protecting nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said the finding of the Rudman  
panel ``sealed the conviction that fundamental change is critically 
needed at the labs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Democrat, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, said '' we need  
to change the law and reorganize this agency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also indicated the administration may accept some  
reshuffling of the department to consolidate the nuclear programs, 
but he still said the proposal for a largely independent nuclear 
agency '' would blur the lines of authority'' between the 
department's science and weapons programs and reduce the authority 
of the energy secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, department officials as many as many as 5,000 nuclear  
scientists and other officials with top-secret clearances will be 
given lie detector tests as part of a broader program to beef up 
security and anti-espionage programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Senate committees -- Armed Services, Intelligence, Energy,  
and Governmental Affairs -- participated in the hearing today on the 
Rudman report. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson told the senators that he already has made  
significant initiatives to streamline counterintelligence and 
security and giving those offices more clout to protect American 
nuclear secrets. Part of the security push will be a wide use of 
polygraph tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward J. Curran, the DOE's director of the counterintelligence,  
said Monday that he anticipates as many as 5,000 nuclear weapons 
scientists and other employees in sensitive jobs will be tested, 
some possibly as early as August. Curran, a veteran FBI agent and 
counterintelligence expert, said he was the first to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing program is expected to be in full swing by  
September, with more than 200 tests a month, or 2,500 a year, 
Curran said. So far 56 counterintelligence officers, including some 
at the nuclear weapons laboratories, have been tested voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulation covering the tests will be published in the  
Federal Register possibly this week, followed by a 30-day comment 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first time any agency outside of the Central  
Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency has engaged in 
widespread use of polygraph tests on workers. The FBI uses the 
devices to screen prospective employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of testing thousands of workers, including most of  
the nuclear weapons scientists at the research labs, has raised 
concern among scientists at the labs. Some worry about the 
reliability of the polygraph and the possibility of career-ending 
``false positive'' findings. Others fear the department's probing 
of their private lives.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ready for some handball? How about fencing,  
table tennis and badminton? 
</P>
<P>
	When NBC turns on its cameras Down Under for the 2000 Olympics,  
the focus will be on the ``traditional theme'' of big sports, big 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	But because of the network's cable branches, in-depth coverage  
will extend to virtually all sports, even the ones that have been 
snubbed before.

<P>
	``The cable really opens up what has not been shown in the  
past,'' NBC Sports president Dick Ebersol told the U.S. Olympic 
Committee's executive committee on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes women's soccer and softball, both all but bypassed  
at the 1996 Atlanta Games despite gold medals for the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Also available for anyone with basic cable -- boxing. A staple of  
television's pioneer days, the sweet science has been an Olympic 
no-show lately because of slumping audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been very, very difficult to put on,'' Ebersol said.  
``We found that a quarter of our audience was driven away as soon 
as we went to boxing. But it will be seen every day on CNBC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC plans 330 hours -- double previous levels -- of Olympic  
programming on its three outlets -- 160 hours on the main network, 
170 on the two cable channels. Ebersol said more than half the 
network programming would be in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC, a news and information channel, will carry the Olympics  
from 10 a.m.-5 p.m. EDT, with CNBC, a financial news programmer, 
taking over after the markets close. 
</P>
<P>
	The main network will again focus on track, gymnastics,  
basketball, swimming and other major sports, with the cable outlets 
carrying the more unfamiliar events. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said NBC will again try to tell a story rather than just  
turn cameras on the action. That practice, while drawing big 
ratings and big profits, has been criticized as narrow, but Ebersol 
said it is necessary when most of the sports are not mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to do it strategically and set up the story,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans for Sydney are not a repeat of TripleCast, NBC's  
innovative but money-losing attempt to give pay-per-view access to 
all sports at the 1992 Barcelona Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the added outlets, Ebersol said four or five of  
the 28 sports will be seen only in wrapup highlights. He did not 
identify those sports. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC has paid $3.6 billion for U.S. Olympic TV rights through  
2008 and is the biggest commercial partner of the International 
Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol, an unabashed fan and scholar of the games, has defended  
the committee during the 7-month-old corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a briefing for the USOC, he called the members of the main  
IOC reform commissions -- appointed in the wake of the Salt Lake 
bribery allegations -- ``unbelievably impressive'' and ``a wonderful 
group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the USOC briefing, Ebersol addressed the IOC's surprise  
choice last week of Turin, Italy, as host city for the 2006 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It follows the IOC's recent preference for venues with more  
size, accommodations and transportation links,'' he said in an 
interview. ``It also is consistent with its desire to acknowledge 
countries that have bid unsuccessfully in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rome lost to Athens, Greece, in a battle for the 2004 Summer  
Games, and other Italian cities have come up short in recent 
Olympic selections. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as NBC was concerned, Ebersol said, just about any city  
with a cold climate can be a Winter Games wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
	``So long as they put it someplace with snow and tall mountains,  
we'll make it look like `The Sound of Music,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC executive committee also agreed to a $75,000-a-year  
independent office to make sure staff members, volunteers and 
Olympic bid cities abide by ethics rules. The plan was part of 
recommendations from an investigation headed by former Senate 
Majority Leader George Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	In another matter, the USOC heard that the IOC had placed a  
three-year limit on reviewing results from the games that might 
have been tainted by drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, USOC president Bill Hybl told IOC vice president  
Anita DeFrantz that he wanted to press demands that the 1976 U.S. 
women's 400-meter medley relay be awarded duplicate gold medals 
after finishing second an East German squad since fund to have 
benefited from illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	And other executive committee members expressed dismay that the  
IOC would place limits on retroactive drug sanctions if new 
evidence came to light. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the biggest deterrent to an athlete using drugs is the  
fear of reprisal 10, 12, 15 years down the road,'' said Bill 
Stapleton, the head of the USOC's athletes advisory council. ``What 
is the IOC's rationale?''

<HEADLINE> Body of Track Athlete May Be Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A body recovered from the shore of Long  
Lake on Tuesday was believed to be a college decathlete missing 
since a raft capsized in the Spokane River last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Positive identification was not immediately made, but the  
Spokane County Sheriff's Office notified the parents of Dusty Lane 
that the body appeared to be their son. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane, 22, is a top decathlete at the Community Colleges of  
Spokane. He recently accepted a full athletic scholarship to the 
University of Alabama for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies were called to Long Lake after a fisherman spotted the  
body floating near the shore. An autopsy was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spokane River flows into Long Lake.  
</P>
<P>
	Lane was wearing a wet suit when he disappeared on June 13 while  
trying to swim to shore at Riverside State Park on the Spokane 
River. The body found Tuesday was wearing a similar wet suit, the 
sheriff's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane was rafting with three friends when the raft capsized in  
the Spokane River's turbulent waters. Three of the rafters made it 
to shore near the Bowl and Pitcher, a rough turn in the river 
favored by kayakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane recently broke the Community Colleges of Spokane's  
decathlon record set by Dan O'Brien, who attended the school and is 
the defending Olympic champion and world record-holder.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Johnson Has Plenty To Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Larry Johnson was exhausted Tuesday from  
guarding Tim Duncan the night before in Game 3 of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't too tired to talk, though.  
</P>
<P>
	In perhaps his longest and most revealing interview since  
joining the New York Knicks three years ago, Johnson used all of 
the required 30 minutes to discuss a wide range of topics on the 
day off before Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	LJ's oratory included only a hint of the pestilence and  
profanity that got him fined $25,000 by the NBA on Sunday, when he 
refused to make himself available for the full media session and 
then cursed reporters and an NBA official. Still, Johnson attracted 
quite a crowd once he got on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of rebellious slaves on this team,'' Johnson  
said. ``I got to explain that? We don't have a lot of mainstream. 
We don't go with the mainstream. We're a different stream on this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson went on to explain that the makeup of the Knicks -- with  
the us-against-the-world mentality he champions -- is starting to 
remind him of the UNLV team he led to an NCAA title in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Tark said ... we don't got time to be trying to be liked  
by the world, we're trying to win basketball games,'' said Johnson, 
who obviously was biting his tongue in an effort not to curse. 
``What do you want to do? You want to win basketball games or be 
liked by the world? We wanted to win basketball games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treading the delicate line that got him fined for the second  
time in the playoffs, Johnson explained his attitude toward the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys, maybe you don't like me or not,'' he said. ``Fine. I  
don't care. Ask my teammates. Ask my coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if those are the only people he cares about, Johnson said,  
``Thank you. ... Them guys out there are the main focus in my 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson scored 16 points in the Knicks' 89-81 victory over San  
Antonio in Game 3 Monday night. His most impressive work, however, 
was the defensive job he did on Duncan. Perhaps feeling a little 
stronger each day as he recovers from a sprained knee, Johnson used 
his muscle and guile to force Duncan away from the basket, where 
7-footers tend to get a little queasy. Duncan scored a series-low 
20 points and was shut out in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a toll on Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot in the tank right now,'' Johnson said.  
``Thank God there's not a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sampling of Johnson's comments:  
</P>
<P>
	--On his critics: ``I used to be almost literally crying at times  
because somebody said something bad about me. And my mom said, 
`Boy, what the hell's wrong with you? Everybody's not going to like 
you, and you don't care whether anybody likes you or not. You be 
yourself.' 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's what I am. I don't care if anybody likes me or not.  
I play basketball. I play for the New York Knicks. My main focus is 
to win, win, win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On his parents: ``My mom's just like me. I wasn't hatched,  
somebody had me. My mom and my pops, who I've never seen, never 
knew in my life, but I get my characteristics from somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On his relationships: ``That's been my whole motto my whole  
life. I don't like this person, this person don't like me. Fine. 
That's mutual respect. Then stay away from each other. But don't 
come to me and smile and then stab me behind my back. I wear my 
heart on my sleeve. I make it known I don't like you. That way we 
don't got to communicate. We're on the same page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On Knicks guards Charlie Ward and Chris Childs: ``They don't  
get as much credit as they deserve. They took a lot of criticism. 
... We've heard time and time again we won't be in the finals, we 
can't win a championship with Charlie and Chris at the point, and 
here we are. Beaucoup respects for those guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CHILDS PLAY?:* Knicks backup point guard Chris Childs sprained  
his knee during Game 3, a similar injury -- although not quite as 
serious -- as the one Larry Johnson sustained in Game 6 against 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Childs was injured in the first half but returned in the second  
half. He said he'll try to play Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was painful, but adrenalin was flowing,'' Childs said.  
``Once you come down off that, that's when it really hits you. You 
lay down and you're not mobile and it tightens up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Childs said he was in so much pain that he did not get any sleep  
after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy said that if Childs is unable to play,  
he'll go with a backcourt of Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston. 
The Knicks are carrying a third point guard, Rick Brunson, who 
seldom plays. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *POP THE PEDESTRIAN:* San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich spent 3 1/2  
hours Monday afternoon walking the streets of midtown Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a Spurs golf shirt, dozens of people recognized him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went into this little dive to get a sandwich and the waiters  
were all over me, wanted to talk about it, wanted tickets, the 
whole deal. It was fun. Great town,'' Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``San Antonio is different, it's spread out. There's only one  
area to walk around, that's the Riverwalk. But in New York you just 
start out in any direction and come back 3-4 hours later. Wherever 
you go, there's something to look at or do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich also learned one unwritten rule about making your way  
around Manhattan on foot: Don't step into the street without 
looking around first. That's taxi territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did it twice, and I learned my lesson quickly,'' he said.  
``They don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WHAT RULES?:* Asked what rules he'd like the NBA to change,  
Spurs guard Steve Kerr said: ``Maybe I'm wrong, but I'd like to see 
them get rid of the illegal defense rule and just see what would 
happen. Experiment with it. I just don't understand why you have to 
guard somebody who can't shoot when he's standing 40 feet from the 
basket.''

<HEADLINE> FTC Approves Supermarket Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government gave its blessing Tuesday to a  
merger of Albertson's Inc. and American Stores Co. that will create 
the second-largest supermarket chain in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	To settle antitrust concerns about overlapping markets resulting  
from the $12 billion deal, the two companies agreed to sell stores 
in the largest retail divestiture in the Federal Trade Commission's 
history. Under the proposed order, the two companies will be forced 
to sell 144 supermarkets and five planned sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Antitrust regulators had contended the deal would substantially  
reduce competition in California, Nevada and New Mexico. Attorneys 
general from the three states helped reach the agreement and filed 
consent decrees in their own federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Albertson's, of Boise, Idaho, operates in the Midwest, West and  
Southern states. The Salt Lake City-based American Stores is spread 
across the country from Boston to California, but most of its 
stores are in California and Texas. The deal gives the companies a 
presence in 38 states and expected revenues of more than $36 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of both grocery stores approved the merger in  
November. It would create the nation's second largest supermarket 
chain after Cincinnati-based Kroger Co. 
</P>
<P>
	William J. Baer, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition,  
said the agreement will ensure that consumers in those states 
``will continue to receive the benefits of competition -- lower 
prices and good quality and selection -- from supermarkets in their 
communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albertson's said it plans to complete its acquisition of  
American Wednesday, but acknowledged that the divestitures were 
greater than they had anticipated. Analysts had predicted the 
companies would have to sell off between 50 and 100 stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``We clearly didn't think it was going to be quite this many,''  
said Albertson's Vice President Mike Read. ``But the board of 
directors and the company have elected to move forward. We still 
think it's a tremendous deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said the cost-savings from running the two  
operations together will be greater than the $300 million it 
initially expected to reach within three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's larger than expected, no question,'' said Mike Shea, an  
analyst with D.A. Davidson &AMP; Co. in Portland, Ore., of the 
divestitures. But he added, ``I think it's a great deal long-term 
for Albertson's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the agreement, the companies would have to  
sell 104 Albertson's supermarkets, 40 American Stores' 
supermarkets, three planned Albertson's stores and two planned 
American Stores in 57 local markets to five buyers. All but two of 
the stores are required to be divested over the next four months, 
according to Albertson's. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, where the stores will have to divest 117  
supermarkets and three planned supermarket sites, Attorney General 
Bill Lockyer said he did not expect a loss of supermarket jobs 
because other retailers will be buying the stores. He said 
supermarket employee unions were consulted in the course of 
investigating the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed order was approved by all four commissioners and is  
subject to a 60-day public comment period before the FTC makes it 
final. The agreement also requires the companies to inform the 
commission over the next 10 years if they plan to buy stores in the 
markets where they were ordered to divest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kroger snapped up some of the supermarkets, saying Tuesday  
it would buy 41 supermarkets from Albertson's -- 40 of them in 
California -- and will operate them under the established West Coast 
name of Ralphs. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors reacted coolly to news of the settlement. In trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Albertson's fell $1.56 1/4 
to $54.37 1/2 while shares of American fell 81 3/4 cents to $34.25, also 
on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Seek Money For Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners, seeking as much as $60  
million in additional public money for Safeco Field, requested 
mediation Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Budgeted at $417 million, the retractable-roof ballpark opens  
July 15. If the team and the government fail to resolve the 
dispute, it could go to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners say the local government is obligated to share  
unexpectedly high revenue from taxes dedicated to ballpark 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have told the Mariners on many occasions that we will not  
seek more public funds,'' said Ken Johnson, executive director of 
the Washington State Public Facilities District, which is 
overseeing construction of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the Mariners' lease and two other agreements with  
the Public Facilities District say the team is responsible for 
additional costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners claim tax revenue is sufficient to support an  
additional $60 million in bonds above the $336 million King County. 
</P>
<P>
	The team contends the original financing agreement requires the  
Public Facilities District ``to seek bond funding from (King) 
County in an amount sufficient to build the stadium, as long as the 
revenues from the dedicated taxes would support it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the Metropolitan King County Council  
unanimously adopted a resolution saying that additional public 
funds should not go toward stadium construction.

<HEADLINE> Berries Used to Enhance Beef Flavor / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORONO, Maine (AP) -- Berry muffins, berry pancakes, berry ice  
cream and berry pastries are popular fare in New England, but 
blueberry burgers? 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Moore, a graduate student at the University of Maine, has  
been mixing blueberries and cranberries into ground beef to make a 
better-tasting frozen burger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first reaction I get from people, typically, is `Oh,''' he  
said. ``I don't let them get away with just an `Oh.' I explain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore is trying to determine whether the antioxidant properties  
of blueberries and cranberries can retard a chemical reaction that 
causes an odd flavor when meat is cooked, chilled and reheated. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to preserve meat's fresh flavor without letting people  
see or taste the berries. His $12,000 study, funded by the Maine 
Blueberry Commission, could lead to a new market for the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	School lunch programs, nursing homes and other institutions that  
reheat meat could use it to preserve flavor. Fast-food restaurants 
could cook burgers one day and reheat them in a microwave the next, 
without sacrificing taste, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mixture might even provide health benefits from the  
antioxidants, which help fight heart disease, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The berry burger combo is just one of the sometimes-odd culinary  
combinations that researchers test in the university's food 
sciences lab in Orono. 
</P>
<P>
	Dehydrated blueberries and frozen soft-shell lobster, which both  
have become important lines of business for Maine companies, 
originated in the food science lab in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	A new $4 million building with an expanded kitchen suite and  
food-tasting laboratory will be built next year to increase the 
amount of testing and private-industry work being done in the food 
science and nutrition department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to branch out into non-food products, like is your  
toilet paper really softer?'' said Mary Ellen Carmine, director of 
the lab program. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the berry burgers, Moore doesn't think there would be a  
home market for the concoction. People would be too turned off by 
the idea of berry-beef to try it. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding test participants is one of the biggest challenges that  
researchers face. With three to six taste tests happening every 
week, there's not much novelty to draw participants. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no shortage of tasters when the subject is lobster, but  
more unusual combinations like blueberries and beef are trickier. 
</P>
<P>
	Test participant Charles Wallace, head of animal science at the  
college, said the berry burgers were ``pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He sampled a cranberry burger, a blueberry burger and a plain  
beef burger. He said he could not tell which burgers contained the 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has no problems with berry beef.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I have any left over, I take it home and use it in lasagna,  
meatloaf, burgers, whatever,'' he said. 
</P>

	COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Corn and sorghum crops are good  
this year, but now Texas farmers face depressed market prices for 
the commodities, the Texas Agricultural Extension Service reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Stichler, extension agronomist in Uvalde, said the corn  
and sorghum harvest was in full swing until showers across South 
Texas slowed it down. 
</P>
<P>
	``The harvest has not been delayed that much,'' he said,  
``because the rains have been scattered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stichler said the crop is good, but storage and sale of the corn  
and sorghum is presenting a problem for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grain facilities are still full from last year,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stichler added that prices are depressed compared to three years  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had a good corn crop in the Midwest for the past  
several years and market prices are very low right now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Blast Caused by NATO Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A NATO cluster bomb that exploded as  
troops cleared munitions from a school killed two peacekeeping 
soldiers and two civilians -- not a Serb booby-trap, the British 
military said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths Monday of Lt. Gareth Evans and Sgt. Balaram Rai were  
the first allied fatalities since NATO peacekeepers entered Kosovo. 
Dozens of civilians, however, have died in explosions of land mines 
and booby-traps since the peacekeeping force began to take control 
of the southern Serb province on June 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion occurred at a schoolhouse in Negrovce, a village  
20 miles west of Pristina, Kosovo's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers, from the British army's 69th Gurkha Field Squadron  
that is mostly made up of Nepalese troops, had been called in by 
villagers who found unexploded cluster bombs at the school, said 
Lt. Col. Nick Clissitt, a spokesman for the British military in 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were munitions used in order to destroy Serb forces in  
the field in what was a Serb army and paramilitary police 
stronghold,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Clissitt said the villagers found the unexploded ordnance and  
had piled it up next to the schoolhouse before calling peacekeepers 
to come and remove it. When the troops showed up, they suggested 
exploding the pile. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the villagers worried the blast would damage their  
school, and agreed to help the peacekeepers move the bombs into 
three smaller piles a short distance away, to create smaller 
explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was during the wiring of the charges that two piles  
detonated prematurely with tragic results,'' Clissitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although unexploded bombs, uncleared minefields and booby-traps  
pose substantial hazards in Kosovo, tens of thousands of refugees 
are disregarding calls for them to stay put in the Albanian and 
Macedonian tent camps until the danger can be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting very worried because people understandably are  
clamoring to come home and we just don't feel the security 
situation warrants that,'' Michael Barton of the International 
Organization for Migration said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton arrived in Macedonia today and told a cheering  
crowd at the Stenkovec refugee camp to seek reconciliation in 
Kosovo -- not revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States remains committed to keeping an autonomous  
Kosovo within Yugoslavia instead of promoting independence for the 
largely Albanian province, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made very clear that we support a very high degree of  
autonomy for Kosovo,'' Albright said after talks with Romanian 
President Emil Constantinescu in Bucharest during a one-day visit. 
``We have not been for Kosovo independence'' but rather ``the 
highest degree of autonomy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said more than 170,000  
of the 860,000 or so refugees expelled from Kosovo have returned in 
little more than a week, 33,000 on Monday alone. Another 600,000 
are in camps or with host families in neighboring countries and 
88,000 more have been evacuated to other countries, including some 
7,500 to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace in Kosovo appeared increasingly strong in the wake of  
Albanian rebels pledging in a pact with NATO to lay down their 
arms. The deal came Monday, just hours after the last of the 40,000 
Serb troops left Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20,000 or so NATO-led KFOR troops now in Kosovo said they  
were moving beyond initial attempts to quell the violence and were 
beginning to look ahead by establishing security and laying the 
groundwork for democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very soon, KFOR will be the only military security presence  
here. That is how it should be,'' British peacekeeping chief Lt. 
Gen. Mike Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Sunday, Jackson received both confirmation that the  
Yugoslav military had withdrawn its forces from Kosovo and a pledge 
from the Kosovo Liberation Army to disband, put down its weapons 
and join efforts to establish peace in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Serb forces' retreat confirmed, NATO officially ended  
its 78-day air campaign. And on Monday, the Belgrade government 
took a reciprocal step, asking parliament to end the state of war 
declared the day NATO launched its airstrikes, the state Tanjug 
news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Since March 24, the state of war has banned men of military age  
from leaving the country, let the army take over key institutions 
and subjected the news media to censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, reports of a media crackdown persisted. An umbrella group  
for Yugoslavia's fledging independent radio and television 
broadcasters said the government was forcing stations to replace 
their newscasts with those of the state-controlled networks. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, the KLA agreed to a broad demilitarization that  
will require them to leave their checkpoints and halt any military 
activity unless the peacekeepers approve it first. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they can keep their handguns, they agreed not to use  
explosives, to put remaining weapons in storage sites verified by 
NATO and to clear minefields and booby-traps within seven days. 
</P>
<P>
	A hard-line Kosovo Albanian rebel, however, said today that the  
demilitarization agreement with NATO does not require the 
guerrillas to surrender their weapons and those who expect the KLA 
to disappear have ``miscalculated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement does not demand that we give up our arms,''  
Rrustem Mustafa told the KLA's Kosova Press news service. ``The 
arms will be gathered at certain places and the KLA will take care 
of them while NATO has a right to observe them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the rank-and-file seemed to be complying with the  
demilitarization pact. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA regional commander in Prizren gave German officers maps  
of minefields -- most near the Albanian border -- as required. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N. official who essentially  
becomes Kosovo's governor under the peace deal, had expressed 
concern that KLA activities could undermine his authority. But on 
Monday, he praised the agreement, and set about the work of 
building peace. 
</P>
<P>
	His tasks include getting electricity, water and other services  
working again across Kosovo; re-establishing civilian courts and 
police forces and preparing for elections.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Start Camby in Game 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Marcus Camby solution didn't turn out  
exactly the way it was supposed to, but coach Jeff Van Gundy wasn't 
complaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure to find some offense for the struggling New York  
Knicks in the NBA Finals, Van Gundy turned to Camby, starting him 
for the first time all season Monday night in Game 3 against San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he came up with a couple of big plays in the fourth  
quarter of the Knicks' 89-81 victory, Camby was limited to just 16 
minutes and fouled out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was crazy. It's almost like a dream come true to hear your  
name being announced in the finals,'' Camby said. ``I was so pumped 
up coming out in that starting lineup, I think I was too aggressive 
coming into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I picked up two early fouls. I just know I've got to remain  
calm, settle down a little and just play smart defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Will he get another chance to start Wednesday?  
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy wasn't saying.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every game develops its own personality,'' he said. ``What you  
try to do after a win or a loss is go back, make the corrections 
that are necessary. You really have no idea how it's going to play 
out. That why everybody has to be ready to contribute what they 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Camby contributed were five points, four rebounds and three  
blocked shots. And six fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby got in foul trouble fast, committing two personals in the  
first six minutes of the game. Then, at the start of the second 
half, he picked up two more quick fouls and headed to the bench 
with no points. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a familiar situation. He finished Game 1 with five  
personals and fouled out of Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the fourth quarter, Camby had one of the rim-rattling  
follow dunks that made him such a factor in the Eastern Conference 
finals against Indiana. But he also committed his fifth personal 
foul two minutes into the period. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely hard when you're sitting on the bench,'' he  
said. ``I want to be out there, playing at all times. I think my 
enthusiasm, my energy got the best of me. I have to settle down and 
remain focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he returned to the game, he missed a dunk but then hit a  
key basket with 2:18 remaining, extending New York's lead to eight 
points. He fouled out in the final minute of the game.

<HEADLINE> U. of Maine Offering Telemarketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- The University of Maine at Augusta is  
offering a program in telemarketing, hoping to answer a growing 
demand for such workers in a state better known for lobsters and 
vacationers. 
</P>
<P>
	The customer-service and telecommunications courses will start  
in the fall. The university has not begun signing up students yet 
but says it has little doubt there is a need for the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had many, many calls from employers just jumping up and  
down they're so excited about it,'' Sheri Fraser of career services 
at UMA said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The telemarketing industry has been exploding in Maine in recent  
years, with new call centers popping up all over. An estimated 
25,000 Mainers work in the telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The UMA course will train not only telemarketers but also people  
who work customer service and help lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools that offer similar courses include Purdue  
University and the University of Central Florida.

	U S West Rebuffs Qwest  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a one-two punch, U S West Inc. became the  
second company in a week to reject, at least for now, a takeover 
bid from Qwest, which is trying to build a global 
telecommunications and Internet company. U S West, the Denver-based 
Baby Bell, decided late yesterday to proceed with its $32.2 billion 
merger with Global Crossing Ltd., spurning a slightly higher rival 
bid from Qwest Communications International Inc. Qwest must now 
decide whether to raise its offer, take the proposal directly to U 
S West shareholders, or simply walk away. Joseph P. Nacchio, 
chairman and chief executive of Qwest, sent a letter today to the 
head of U S West in an effort to open discussions.

	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Authorities are searching for an  
unlicensed money manager who vanished, allegedly with millions of 
dollars in clients' money, and left behind burned, shredded 
documents and astrological charts. Estimates of the amount of money 
missing range from $218 million to $3 billion. Martin Frankel has 
been missing since May 5, when firefighters went to his 
high-security mansion and found a blazing file cabinet and two 
fireplaces stuffed with burning documents. A federal grand jury in 
Bridgeport has been investigating Frankel and his brokerage. And 
the New York Daily News reported today, citing unidentified law

	PARIS (AP) -- French national carrier Air France said today it  
would form a partnership with Delta Air Lines to build a worldwide 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the partnership were not disclosed. Air France had said  
it was in talks with Delta and Continental Airlines and would 
select one of the two U.S. companies to create a commercial 
alliance. Air France already has code sharing agreements with both 
Delta and Continental. Under a code-sharing arrangement, airlines 
share flight numbers, meaning passengers who book flights with one 
airline may actually fly on a partner airline's jet.

<HEADLINE> Jonas Salk Biotech Co. Retrenches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- A biotech company founded by the late  
Jonas Salk to find a cure for AIDS trimmed its work force by nearly 
a third, cut salaries and shifted some of its pharmaceutical work 
to a larger partner company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immune Response Corp., based in Carlsbad, announced the  
cost-cutting moves yesterday, just a month after calling off a 
study of its Remune AIDS drug involving 2,500 patients. Company 
executives then said that it was difficult to find investors for 
new clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	The company cut 43 employees, including a vice president, and  
remaining executives will take pay cuts, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will continue work on the Remune AIDS drug with San  
Diego-based Agouron Pharmaceuticals, which was recently acquired by 
health care giant Warner-Lambert. Agouron had already been 
providing some funding for the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to make sure Remune gets to the finish line,'' said  
Dennis Carlo, chief executive for Immune Response. ``This is going 
to put us in a much better position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immune Response expects better results from new trials, but they  
won't be available until at least 2001, Carlo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new trials will measure levels of the HIV virus which causes  
AIDS rather than the time it takes patients to die. The previous 
approach proved problematic because patients were living longer due 
to advances in AIDS treatments and made it difficult to determine 
whether patients were living longer by taking Remune.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Committed to Kosovo Autonomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- The United States remains committed to  
keeping an autonomous Kosovo within Yugoslavia instead of promoting 
independence for the largely Albanian province, Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made very clear that we support a very high degree of  
autonomy for Kosovo,'' Albright told reporters after talks with 
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu. ``We have not been for 
Kosovo independence'' but rather ``the highest degree of 
autonomy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright arrived here from the Bulgarian capital of Sofia as  
part of a one-day visit to Yugoslavia's Balkan neighbors to assure 
them of U.S. support for economic development in the region. The 
NATO air campaign brought economic hardship to many Balkan 
countries that normally trade with Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has promised to promote development  
and democracy in the traditionally unstable Balkans but has made 
clear that Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia, will not 
receive assistance as long as Slobodan Milosevic remains in power. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be working very hard for supporting democratization  
... within Serbia,'' Albright said. ``We believe that ultimately a 
democratic Serbia could change the entire situation in the region 
and that we should support open media in Serbia ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	To the delight of officials and Romanian reporters present,  
Albright also said that the United States supports Romania's 
aspirations to join NATO. ``In many respects, Romania is already a 
valid member of NATO,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Yankees 7, Devil Rays 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Bernie Williams went 4-for-5 Tuesday  
night to back Orlando Hernandez, who threw the first complete game 
of the season for the New York Yankees, a three-hitter, in a 7-0 
victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, primarily a clean-up hitter this season, continued to  
flourish in the No. 2 spot in the batting order with two doubles, 
two singles and an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Spencer hit a solo homer off Alan Newman and four others --  
Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez and Jorge Posada -- also 
drove in runs for the Yankees, who are 12-1 against Tampa Bay over 
the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez (8-6) stopped the Devil Rays' longest winning streak  
in more than a month at three games by limiting Tampa Bay to 
singles by John Flaherty, Dave Martinez and Wade Boggs and not 
allowing a runner past first base. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees right-hander didn't allow a hit after the fifth  
inning, struck out three and walked one to give New York its first 
complete game since Hernandez beat Pedro Martinez and the Boston 
Red Sox 3-0 last Sept. 14 for the only other shutout of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Witt (3-4), who hasn't won in nine starts since May 1,  
allowed four runs, five hits and walked three in 1 1-3 inning, his 
shortest outing of the season for Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays starter allowed RBI singles by Jeter and O'Neill  
in the first, while a third run in the inning scored when Jeter 
stole third base and raced home on a throwing error by Flaherty. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams made it 4-0 with an RBI single off Witt in the second.  
He doubled off Rick White in the fifth before scoring on a single 
by Martinez. Posada singled two outs later to drive in Jeter, who 
had been hit by a pitch, for a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Yankees manager Joe Torre juggled the middle of his  
batting order last Friday, Williams is 9-for-16 with five 
extra-base hits and seven runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was the ninth straight at home for Tampa Bay, which won  
the last three games of a 15-day, 13-game road trip for their 
longest winning streak since mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Torre said he received a telephone message from suspended  
outfielder Darryl Strawberry and plans to return the call while the 
team is in St. Petersburg ... Witt made his team-high 14th start 
for Tampa Bay. The Devils Rays were 5-0 in his first five starts, 
but are 0-9 in his last nine. The right-hander was the loser in 
four of those games ... Tampa Bay, coming off the longest road trip 
in the club's brief history, hasn't won a home series since May 4-6 
when the Devil Rays took two of three from Kansas City. They've 
lost 11 of 12 at Tropicana Field since then ... Jeter has reached 
base in 67 of the Yankees' 68 games ... The crowd of 30,290 was the 
largest at Tropicana Field since the home opener.

flourish in the No. 2 spot in the batting order with two doubles, 
two singles and an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Spencer hit a solo homer off Alan Newman and four others --  
Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez and Jorge Posada -- also 
drove in runs for the Yankees, who are 12-1 against Tampa Bay over 
the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez (8-6) stopped the Devil Rays' longest winning streak  
in more than a month at three games by limiting Tampa Bay to 
singles by John Flaherty, Dave Martinez and Wade Boggs and not 
allowing a runner past first base. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees right-hander didn't allow a hit after the fifth  
inning, struck out three and walked one to give New York its first 
complete game since Hernandez beat Pedro Martinez and the Boston 
Red Sox 3-0 last Sept. 14 for the only other shutout of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Witt (3-4), who hasn't won in nine starts since May 1,  
allowed four runs, five hits and walked three in 1 1-3 inning, his 
shortest outing of the season for Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays starter allowed RBI singles by Jeter and O'Neill  
in the first, while a third run in the inning scored when Jeter 
stole third base and raced home on a throwing error by Flaherty. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams made it 4-0 with an RBI single off Witt in the second.  
He doubled off Rick White in the fifth before scoring on a single 
by Martinez. Posada singled two outs later to drive in Jeter, who 
had been hit by a pitch, for a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Yankees manager Joe Torre juggled the middle of his  
batting order last Friday, Williams is 9-for-16 with five 
extra-base hits and seven runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was the ninth straight at home for Tampa Bay, which won  
the last three games of a 15-day, 13-game road trip for their 
longest winning streak since mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Torre said he received a telephone message from suspended  
outfielder Darryl Strawberry and plans to return the call while the 
team is in St. Petersburg ... Witt made his team-high 14th start 
for Tampa Bay. The Devils Rays were 5-0 in his first five starts, 
but are 0-9 in his last nine. The right-hander was the loser in 
four of those games ... Tampa Bay, coming off the longest road trip 
in the club's brief history, hasn't won a home series since May 4-6 
when the Devil Rays took two of three from Kansas City. They've 
lost 11 of 12 at Tropicana Field since then ... Jeter has reached 
base in 67 of the Yankees' 68 games ... The crowd of 30,290 was the 
largest at Tropicana Field since the home opener.

<HEADLINE> Crate &AMP; Barrel Recalls Kids' Tables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Home furnishings company Crate &AMP; Barrel is  
recalling about 4,300 children's tables that have six-inch holes in 
the center because children's heads can become stuck in the holes, 
the Consumer Product Safety Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crate &AMP; Barrel, of Northbrook, Ill., has received four reports  
of children becoming trapped in the table openings. Two children 
required emergency help to free them, the CPSC said in a statement 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tables being recalled were sold at the company's stores  
around the country and through a holiday catalog for about $75 
alone or for $135 as a set with chairs. The tables, 27 inches by 27 
inches, have a red canvas bag hanging in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Crate &AMP; Barrel will provide a free repair part that will  
permanently close the hole. Consumers should call the company at 
800-897-5919 between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. EDT.

<HEADLINE>  Agent Files Lawsuit Against NFLPA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sports agent William ``Tank'' Black sued the NFL Players  
Association on Tuesday, contending his business has been hurt by a 
complaint from the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington. Mike  
Butler, spokesman for Black's company, Professional Management 
Inc., said only that the suit addresses the disciplinary complaint 
the union filed against Black last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFLPA accused Black of making improper contact with former  
Florida players. The union could revoke Black's license if it finds 
him guilty of paying players before their eligibility had expired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen it, but I can tell you this, I would expect it  
to have no effect on our disciplinary proceedings which are ongoing 
and require an answer from Mr. Black at the end of the month,'' 
NFLPA attorney Richard Berthelsen said. ``If this is an answer to 
our disciplinary complaint, it's an obvious attempt to deflect 
attention away from his conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black and lawyer Leonard Mungo have called a news conference for  
Wednesday in Orlando, Fla., to discuss the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have lost tremendously in a couple of areas,'' Black told  
The Florida Today. ``I've lost four clients -- and they were top 
clients -- and, obviously, the funds associated with the clients 
over the next 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One player, Johnny Rutledge, said he accepted $500 payments from  
Black last year while still enrolled at Florida. Rutledge said he 
and two other former Gators, Jevon Kearse and Reggie McGrew, have 
made sworn statements saying they received payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Black and Mungo have argued that the NFLPA's disciplinary system  
violates Black's civil rights, forcing the agent to prove himself 
innocent after being accused. They have also charged that the NFLPA 
unlawfully used the powers of the University of Florida police, 
which is also investigating Black, to further its own search. 
</P>
<P>
	Mungo has complained that NFLPA representative Trace Armstrong  
was present during police questioning of players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to turn down information because it comes from  
sources outside the NFL. If we did, we're not doing our jobs,'' 
Berthelsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berthelsen said the NFLPA has evidence apart from that gleaned  
during the interview that Armstrong attended. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said all agents sign a contract stating they understand  
union policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Black is also working on a reply to the NFLPA complaint.  
</P>
<P>
	University police have not filed any charges. They declined  
comment on the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Royals Claim Right-Hander Suzuki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Kansas City Royals claimed  
right-hander Mac Suzuki off waivers from the Mets on Tuesday, 
before he even pitched a game for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki, acquired Friday from Seattle with a player to be named  
for Allen Watson, needed to clear waivers before the Mets could 
send him to the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki is the first Japanese-born player to play in the major  
leagues without starting his career in Japan's professional 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	During three major league seasons with Seattle, Suzuki was 1-4  
with a 9.17 ERA in 23 games, including nine starts. He was 0-2 with 
a 9.43 ERA in 16 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets replaced Suzuki on the 25-man roster with infielder  
Melvin Mora, who was called up from Triple-A Norfolk.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall; Yield Inches Up / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Tuesday as investors continued  
to sell Treasury securities in anticipation of several upcoming 
corporate bond offerings. Yields remained above 6 percent for the 
second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 15/32  
point, or $4.69 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 6.06 percent from 6.02 percent late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Debt issuers see this week's lack of economic reports, which  
could influence interest rates, as a window of opportunity to sell 
about $10 billion in new corporate debt. That is providing 
competition to Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down between 1/16 point and 1/8 point, and intermediate 
maturities were down 5/32 point to 9/32, reported Bridge Telerate, 
a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.72 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point from Monday's auction rate to 
4.60 percent. Six-month yields were 5.03 percent, as the discount 
fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.84 percent. One-year yields were 
5.13 percent as the discount was unchanged from late Monday at 4.87 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.63 percent from 4.75 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 9/16 to 119 27/32. The average yield to 
maturity rose to 5.48 percent from 5.44 percent.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Cup TV Ratings Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time in five years, the Stanley  
Cup finals went more than four games, but television ratings didn't 
jump much. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN and Fox each aired three games in the Dallas Stars-Buffalo  
Sabres series, and both had a minimal ratings increase from last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's three-game average was a 3.09 rating, up 17 percent from  
last year's 2.65. The cable network had a controversial 
triple-overtime thriller in Game 6, which received a 3.51 mark, the 
highest-rated game in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ratings were up and everything was coming to a great ending  
for the first time in five years,'' ESPN analyst Bill Clement said. 
``But I don't think it will hurt our viewership in the long term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, which lost its NHL rights to ABC beginning next season,  
posted a 3.4 mark -- an increase of 3 percent from the 3.3 it 
received for Game 1 of the 1998 Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program.

<HEADLINE> Angels Extend Collins' Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Anaheim Angels' response to the team's free  
fall in the AL West was to give manager Terry Collins a contract 
extension Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the right guy to turn this thing around a few years  
ago, and he's still the right guy,'' general manager Bill Bavasi 
said. ``Our problems right now are that we're not hitting. We 
started working on this in the spring. We're happy to have this 
taken care of, and I'm sure Terry's happy to have it taken care 
of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The length of the extension was not revealed, but negotiations  
reportedly were for two more years through 2001 with a team option 
for 2002. Collins received a similar deal when he came to Anaheim 
in 1997 after Houston fired him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy about it because we've got some unfinished business  
to do here and we think we can still get it done,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim lost five of six on an East Coast trip and began Tuesday  
last in the AL West at 30-38, 8 1/2 games behind division-leading 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk of player dissatisfaction with Collins' style surfaced in  
late May, then quieted. The team had a 45-minute meeting last week 
in Toronto after a 13-2 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``The contract issue is a dead issue,'' Bavasi said. ``The issue  
of player complaints was a dead issue a long time ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bavasi said the complaints, which he declined to divulge, didn't  
take long to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	``As employers, we have a responsibility to listen and evaluate.  
This time, in about 15 minutes, we decided their complaints weren't 
worth worrying about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said his contract extension was a relief ``in some  
ways.'' As for the complaints, he said the team has ``a job to do 
on the field and that's where the focus should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players seemed to take sides, at least for a brief period,  
after several unidentified Angels went to Bavasi with complaints 
about Collins' managing style. 
</P>
<P>
	``All said and done,'' Bavasi said, ``it was kind of refreshing  
to have a much larger group of guys on our club more hard-edged and 
with a desire to win, who far outnumber the soft-guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, 198-191 with the Angels' going into Tuesday night's  
game, has heard criticism that is is too intense for his players. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm more emotional than Lou Piniella or Tom Lasorda,  
they're pretty good managers,'' he said. ``We all care, and that's 
all that matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim thought it would contend after signing Mo Vaughn to an  
$80 million, six-year contract in November, but Vaughn was hurt on 
opening day, just one of many injuries on the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, activated Tuesday following a  
nine-game rehabilitation assignment in the minors, hasn't played 
this year after breaking his left forearm in the spring. Sluggers 
Tim Salmon and Jim Edmonds are sidelined for extended periods. 
</P>
<P>
	``People talk about curses, things like that,'' Vaughn said.  
``Things just happen. Sometimes things get hard. The main thing is, 
no one out there is going to let up because the Angels have 
injuries. I don't like to talk about injuries too much. The other 
teams don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina broke his arm when hit by a fungo bat in February.  
Cleanup hitter Salmon is expected back soon after spraining his 
left wrist diving for a fly ball May 3. Gold Glove center fielder 
Edmonds won't play until at least August after shoulder surgery 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``All four years I've been here, I've never seen a team  
decimated like this one is,'' second baseman Randy Velarde said. 
``We lost guys for months, or a year, at a time.''

<HEADLINE> Autopsy: Tuinei Died of Overdose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	McKINNEY, Texas (AP) -- Former Dallas Cowboys offensive tackle  
Mark Tuinei died of a lethal combination of heroin and a form of 
the drug ecstasy, according to autopsy results released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its final autopsy report, the Collin County Medical  
Examiner's office ruled Tuinei's death was an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical examiner Dr. William Rohr said the autopsy showed the  
39-year-old former All-Pro offensive lineman administered the drugs 
to himself intravenously. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rohr said there's no way to tell whether Tuinei had used the  
drugs before. He says no needle marks were found on the body, but 
added Tuinei could have used a small needle without leaving a 
trace. 
</P>
<P>
	Friend and former teammate Nicky Sualua told police he found  
Tuinei unconscious in his car outside Tuinei's home in Plano the 
morning of May 6. Sualua revived him briefly through CPR, but 
Tuinei was dead when he arrived at a hospital.

that: Hours after he was charged Monday in the Gorham killings, the 
FBI said it was investigating whether he was involved in two 
killings 335 miles away in northern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez, put on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list Monday,  
is wanted for questioning in five killings in Texas and one in 
Kentucky since August 1997. Authorities suspect he has been 
hitching rides on trains, finding his victims on or near the rails. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents in Texas say they are getting calls about  
Resendez-Ramirez from all over the country. The FBI in Wisconsin 
warned law enforcement agencies to be on the lookout. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez was charged in the June 15 deaths of George  
Morber Sr. and his daughter, Carolyn Frederick, Jackson County 
State's Attorney Mike Wepseic said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morber, 80, was shot in the head with a shotgun in his mobile  
home yards from a Union Pacific rail line. Investigators say they 
believe Resendez-Ramirez used the gun to fatally beat Frederick, 
52, in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Morber's truck was found Wednesday in a school parking lot in  
Cairo, about 60 miles south of Gorham. State's Attorney Mike 
Wepseic said fingerprints connect Resendez-Ramirez to the two 
southern Illinois slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings have resulted in unusual measures for this sleepy  
farm community of some 400 people about 110 miles southeast of St. 
Louis, where the tiny downtown and many homes face railroad tracks 
across two lanes of blacktop. Residents said they are locking their 
doors and being more cautious for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our community has just been stunned by this senseless act,''  
said Morber's son, Bill Morber. ``Everyone is scared, they're on 
edge, and I think they will be until this Ramirez is caught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Meade, who said she grew up with Frederick, said residents  
of the close-knit community of farmers and prison workers were 
particularly angry that the killings robbed Frederick's three grown 
children of their mother and Morber's ailing wife of her primary 
caretakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a good mother. He was a good man,'' she said.  
``Ramirez, he deserves to be blown away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI officials said the agency was assisting authorities in Jo  
Daviess County in northwest Illinois to determine whether two 
deaths in Apple River could be linked to Resendez-Ramirez. The 
agency also said it has been asked by authorities in Pontiac, 
southwest of Chicago, to look into a killing there for any possible 
link. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Darin J. Oellerich, 23, and Rhonda Sue Wurm, 25,  
were discovered Sunday in their rented farmhouse near a railroad 
line, the Jo Daviess County sheriff's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pontiac, the body of 40-year-old Juanita Sapp was discovered  
Wednesday in the bushes outside her apartment complex across the 
street from railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of those three killings have not been released. In most  
of the killings in which Resendez-Ramirez is suspected, the victims 
were beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's demonstrated he can use almost any kind of object to take  
a human life in a very violent manner, and we've got to try and 
catch him,'' said Don K. Clark, the special agent in charge of 
FBI's Houston office and leader of a nationwide task force 
searching for the suspect. The task force has more than 200 
investigators working the case. 
</P>
<P>
	As for a motive, Clark said: ``I wish I could tell you.''  
</P>
<P>
	The task force, assembled earlier this month after authorities  
allegedly connected the killings, has stopped and searched freight 
trains as part of its manhunt, and freight railroads have stepped 
up security, watching for drifters hopping trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Resendez-Ramirez, a 38-year-old native of  
Puebla, Mexico, has used numerous aliases and changes his 
appearance by altering his hair style and wearing glasses. He has 
scars on his right ring finger, left wrist and forehead, a snake 
tattoo on his left arm and may have a flower tattoo on his left 
wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-convict has a criminal record in California, Florida and  
New Mexico on weapons and burglary charges.

<HEADLINE> Gehry To Design Wing for Corcoran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The capital's oldest art museum is about to  
get a new wing, built in big sweeping curves to contrast with the 
classic columns and broad stairways of most of Washington's 
official structures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll look something like the museum he did in Bilbao --  
unmistakably Gehry,'' said Arthur Cotton Moore, a leading architect 
who advises the Corcoran Gallery of Art. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank O. Gehry is the designer whose radical concept for the  
Guggenheim Museum in the Spanish port city helped earn him the 
American Institute of Architects gold medal this year. One 
architectural critic said it looks like ``an explosion in a 
titanium factory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian-born Gehry, 70, won the Corcoran job from 200  
competitors in a yearlong selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot depends on the site,'' said Tiko Campbell, a Washington  
architect, who thinks the original Guggenheim Museum in New York, 
designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, would look better in Central Park 
on the west side of Fifth Avenue, instead of across the street from 
the park where it was built. 
</P>
<P>
	Gehry's Cocoran site will be far different from Bilbao.  
</P>
<P>
	In Bilbao, he had a broad area on the bank of the Nervion River.  
In Washington, his new building will be invisible from the museum's 
main facade on 17th Street, just 200 yards from the west wing of 
the White House. Instead, Gehry's building will have about 200 feet 
of frontage on New York Avenue -- a much quieter street. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the site of the 1997 standoff between the Corcoran and  
the Russian Embassy, which was trying to reclaim a show that 
included imperial Russian jewels as it was being loaded for 
transport to its next exhibit site. The dispute over money was 
settled after two weeks and the show went on to a successful tour 
before returning to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	The new building will give the gallery 118,000 square feet of  
additional space, housing its art school and an expanded children's 
center. It will free up 19 galleries on the old building's upper 
floors, now used for storage and offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Cost is estimated at $40 million from private fund-raising.  
</P>
<P>
	The Corcoran's main building has a severe classical facade -- no  
columns but a doorway in ancient Greek style, flanked by bronze 
lions. The original building was constructed in 1897, with an 
addition built in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent bow to contemporary taste, the gallery erected a  
three-story statue by Roy Lichtenstein, painted black, white, 
yellow, blue and green and called ``Brushstroke Group.'' It 
advertises a gallery show of sculpture by Lichtenstein, who is 
known for the small regular dots of old comic strips that appear in 
much of his work. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Atherton, secretary of the Fine Arts Commission, said he  
was impressed with Gehry's presentation to the Corcoran. The 
architect had ``thought about it from the ground up,'' Atherton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so constrained,'' he added. ``It's an unconventional  
enclosure of space. It'll be talked about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J. Carter Brown, chairman of the commission, said he believes  
Gehry is one of the greatest architects around, but he noted that 
the panel has not given its formal approval because there has been 
no final design offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Gehry has produced several designs. Although one model is to be  
revealed Wednesday, he will work with the Corcoran staff on a final 
version.

<HEADLINE> Four ADA Cases Decided by the Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The four cases involving the Americans with Disabilities Act  
decided Tuesday by the Supreme Court: 
</P>
<P>
	--Sutton vs. United Airlines. Twin sisters Karen Sutton and  
Kimberly Hinton, both regional airline pilots based in Colorado, 
sued after United rejected their job application because they are 
extremely nearsighted. The sisters have 20-200 vision when not 
wearing glasses or contacts, but 20-20 vision when wearing them. 
Supreme Court ruled the sisters are not protected by the law. 
</P>
<P>
	--Murphy vs. UPS. Vaughn Murphy of Manhattan, Kan., sued after  
United Parcel Service in Topeka, Kan., fired him from his job as a 
truck mechanic because he has high blood pressure. Supreme Court 
ruled Murphy is not protected by the law. 
</P>
<P>
	--Albertsons vs. Kirkingburg. Hallie Kirkingburg worked for a  
supermarket chain as a truck driver before he was fired for failing 
a Department of Transportation vision test. He is almost blind in 
one eye. A veteran driver, Kirkingburg had an impeccable 
driving-safety record. Supreme Court ruled he is not protected by 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
	--Olmstead vs. L.C. Mentally disabled patients Elaine Wilson and  
Lois Curtis sued Georgia to get out of a state hospital in Atlanta 
and be placed in a home-like setting. Supreme Court ruled both 
women are protected by the law and sent the case back to a federal 
appeals court to decide whether Georgia's treatment of them was 
justified.

	Stocks Close Lower; Dow Down 94.35  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today, halting the Nasdaq  
composite index's bid for a new closing high, as investors remained 
antsy about interest rates and company profits for the nearly 
finished quarter. An afternoon rebound in the Dow Jones industrial 
average fizzled, and the blue chips finished 94.35 lower at 
10,721.63. Broader stock indicators also posted considerable 
losses. The Nasdaq composite came within 10 points of the April 26 
closing record of 2,652.05 before turning lower and ending a 
five-session winning streak that had boosted the measure nearly 10 
percent. It was down 50.02 at 2,580.26.

	Panel: E-Commerce Levy Inevitable  
</P>
<P>
	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Get set for a sales tax on internet  
purchases one of these days. That was the gist of opening remarks 
by members of a congressional Internet tax study panel at a meeting 
today. ``We must not allow the Internet to become a tax haven that 
drains the revenue governments need to provide the services that 
citizens demand,'' said commission member Joseph Guttentag, a top 
Treasury Department official. His view was echoed by the other 
federal, state and local government officials on the panel and, 
more importantly, by most of those representing the business 
sector.

	FTC Approves Supermarket Merger  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission said today it has  
approved the proposed merger of Albertson's Inc. and American 
Stores Co., after the two stores agreed to sell 144 supermarkets 
and five planned sites to settle concerns about overlapping 
markets. The agreement would require the largest retail divestiture 
ever ordered by the FTC. It was reached with the aid of attorneys 
general in the three states where antitrust regulators had charged 
the deal would substantially reduce competition -- California, 
Nevada and New Mexico. 

</P>

	Rite Aid, drugstore.com Make Deal  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp. will spend $7.6 million for about  
a 25 percent stake in online retailer drugstore.com in a move that 
will accelerate the efforts of the nation's third-largest drugstore 
chain to sell pharmaceuticals and beauty aids over the Internet. 
Through drugstore.com, shoppers will be able to buy prescription 
drugs online for delivery by mail or for same-day pickup at any of 
the 3,800 Rite Aid stores nationwide. The deal, announced today , 
will make drugstore.com the only online pharmacy that will have 
access to the more than 50 million consumers whose prescription 
drug benefits are managed by Rite Aid.

	Steel Bill Loses Key Senate Vote  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. steel industry lost a key vote in the  
Senate today as a measure to impose quotas on foreign steel 
shipments failed to clear a procedural hurdle. The Senate voted 
42-57 to restrict debate on the bill -- 18 short of the 60 votes 
needed, and short even of getting a majority. Supporters of the 
measure sought quotas as a way to help combat low-priced steel 
imports and preserve U.S. steelworking jobs. Clinton administration 
officials and other opponents of the bill argued that it might 
backfire against U.S. exports.

	World Bank Postpones Vote on China  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid mounting opposition, the World Bank put  
off until Thursday a vote on a controversial project to resettle 
58,000 poor Chinese farmers on land Tibetans say is traditionally 
theirs. The bank said today the decision to delay the meeting of 
the executive board for two days will enable James D. Wolfensohn, 
the president of the 182-nation organization, to chair the session. 
He is in Europe. But the postponement, requested by senior board 
member Andrei Bugrov of Russia, allows more time to find a 
compromise. Half the board's 24 members, including the United 
States, France, Germany and Switzerland, urged Wolfensohn to try to 
reach a settlement with Beijing.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- U S West Inc. became the second company in a  
week to reject, at least for now, a takeover bid from Qwest, which 
is trying to build a global telecommunications and Internet 
company. U S West, the Denver-based Baby Bell, decided late 
yesterday to proceed with its $32.2 billion merger with Global 
Crossing Ltd., spurning a slightly higher rival bid from Qwest 
Communications International Inc. Qwest must now decide whether to 
raise its offer, take the proposal directly to U S West 
shareholders, or simply walk away.

	Unlicensed Insurance Broker Sought  
</P>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- A money manager has vanished with as  
much as $3 billion in clients' money, leaving behind a things-to-do 
list (item No. 1: ``Launder money'') and astrological charts 
designed to answer such pressing questions as ``Will I go to 
prison?'' Martin Frankel, 44, has not been seen since May 5, when 
an automatic alarm called firefighters to his high-security mansion 
in this rich New York City suburb. They found a blazing file 
cabinet and two fireplaces stuffed with burning documents. Last 
month, insurance company regulators said Frankel's unlicensed 
brokerage -- apparently run out of the Greenwich mansion -- had 
siphoned off money from a dozen small insurance companies in five 
states. A sealed warrant has been issued for his arrest, the New 
York Daily News reported Today, citing unidentified law enforcement 
sources.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Six months after the first global conference on  
the millennium bug, experts from over 170 countries met today at 
the United Nations to assess progress in dealing with Year 2000 
problems and preparations for coping with possible computer 
glitches. Carlos Braga, director of the World Bank's Y2K program, 
said it was encouraging that over 100 developing countries had now 
initiated national programs, compared with fewer than 10 countries 
in January 1998. ``In spite of all our efforts it's impossible to 
guarantee that there will be no disruptions due to the Y2K problem. 
With less than 200 days remaining until the century date change, 
this outlook is unlikely to change significantly,'' Braga said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Offers Education Flexibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Surrounded by cheering schoolchildren from  
their districts, GOP leaders on Tuesday introduced a plan to give 
states the power to use federal funds for their own priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, the government just looked to see where the money  
went,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House 
Education and Workforce Committee. ``But all the studies, 
evaluations and reports show little or no academic results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Leader Dennis  
Hastert also threw their support behind the flexibility plan, which 
has the support of many states seeking ``freedom'' from federal 
regulations tied to the programs the Education Department 
administers. Republican lawmakers said the bill was on a 
``fast-track'' to reach their colleagues for a vote and could 
happen this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Education is number one on the Republican agenda,'' Lott said.  
</P>
<P>
	Chris Webster, a fifth-grader from Chantilly, Va., was among the  
crowd of children who stood steps away from the Capitol in front of 
a school bus decorated with balloons. 
</P>
<P>
	He too spoke about ``freedom'' -- to ride his bike this summer  
and play with his friends -- but said his parents also would have 
him write book reports, something the 11-year-old compared to what 
he called the ``accountability'' of the Republicans' bill. He added 
that the lawmakers' idea could improve his education without 
``raising my parents' taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats and some education groups say they plan will let  
states divert federal money from poor students to wealthier 
districts and allow public spending on private education. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could in fact serve as a gateway to private school  
vouchers,'' Education Secretary Richard Riley said in a statement 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. William L. Clay of Missouri, the top House Democrat that  
handles education policy, said the bill would lead to cuts in 
education spending. 
</P>
<P>
	This newest bill -- called the Academic Achievement for All Act,  
or Straight A's -- comes ahead of the expiration this year of a 
comprehensive $12 billion-a-year federal law that gives states and 
local school districts money to help poor students. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans and Democrats have been divided over  
how to rework it. 
</P>
<P>
	The first education law passed this session was the  
Republican-favored ``ed flex'' bill, which represented the first 
GOP push to give states more control. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``ed-flex'' bill, signed by Clinton, let states and school  
districts apply money for certain federal programs to other federal 
programs that serve their students best. For example, schools could 
use federal money meant for science and math teachers to boost 
reading instruction if that's what they deemed was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Straight A's would extend what the states could do with that  
money, which has drawn protests from some groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``States haven't had time to test the flexibility just granted  
them,'' said Kati Haycock of the Education Trust, a 
Washington-based research group. ``Yet Straight A's supporters are 
already saying `it's not enough.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a government report, Haycock said that in 45 of 47 states  
it was federal funds, more often than state funds, that were used 
to help poor children. And in nearly half of those states, the 
poorest districts got less state money.

<HEADLINE> Panel Weighs Internet Tax Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- If its initial squabble over fund  
raising is any guide, a commission created to recommend future 
Internet tax policy has a tough road ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural meeting Monday of the 19-member Advisory  
Commission on Electronic Commerce focused on how to solicit private 
money to operate and still avoid any perceptions of a pro-business 
bias. Congress provided no money when it created the panel last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want it to look like people are buying access, buying  
influence,'' said commission member David Pottruck, president of 
Charles Schwab Corp. ``It could become a quagmire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel could not resolve the issue Monday after several  
members balked at a proposal by its chairman, Republican Gov. Jim 
Gilmore of Virginia, for each member to contribute up to $150,000 
each -- as Virginia has already done. It is expected to try to reach 
a compromise today on how to finance a projected $1.7 million 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The fear was that contributions from well-heeled companies  
represented on the panel such, as AT&AMP;T, MCI Worldcom and Gateway 
Inc., would outstrip those from state and local governments, 
leading to a perception of bias. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the money comes disproportionately from one side of the  
debate, it my be perceived by some to taint the commission's 
ultimate conclusions,'' said panel member Andrew Pincus, general 
counsel for the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress created the commission to sort out tax issues on  
Internet commerce after lawmakers imposed a three-year moratorium 
on new e-commerce taxes. The panel's report is due in April 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission was delayed for months because organizations  
representing state and local governments filed a federal lawsuit 
claiming the initial appointments were illegally tilted toward 
business. The lawsuit was dropped after Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., replaced Netscape chief James Barksdale with a 
local government official from Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	That conflict and the one over financing demonstrate the  
sensitive nature of the commission's work: How to ensure state and 
local tax collections don't suffer from electronic commerce while 
avoiding a new, heavy tax burden on the companies doing a 
fast-growing business on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal would be to see that whatever solution comes out of  
this strikes the proper balance in a real and credible way,'' said 
Robert Novick, general counsel for U.S. Trade Representative 
Charlene Barshefsky and a commission member. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission today also planned to hear several presentations  
on tax issues surrounding the Internet, both domestic and 
international. It will have at least three other meetings -- one 
each in California's Silicon Valley, New York City and Austin, 
Texas.

that spell out the roles of state agencies and managed care 
organizations in detecting fraud and abuse in Medicaid managed care 
plans, according to a report by government auditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health and Human Services Department's inspector general  
concluded that Medicaid managed care plans face many of the same 
types of fraud and abuse found in traditional Medicaid programs. 
But unlike traditional plans, there are no clear guidelines 
detailing who is responsible for spotting and referring potential 
fraud cases for investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study of 10 states using managed care for recipients of  
Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, most state 
agencies reported limited oversight and fraud identification 
efforts. Few said they reviewed the efforts by managed care 
organizations to check for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although requirements exist for detection and investigation of  
claims related fraud cases occurring in traditional Medicaid 
programs, there have been few requirements developed to 
specifically address fraud detection and referral in the managed 
care setting,'' the auditors concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The report called on the Health Care Financing Administration to  
create guidelines that clearly define the responsibilities of state 
agencies, managed care plans and fraud control units in detecting 
abuse and fraud. It also recommended that states monitor compliance 
of managed care organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``As managed care plans provide medical services for more and  
more individuals who are on Medicaid, we must work closely with the 
managed care organizations and state agencies to ensure that they 
are fully equipped to deal with emerging fraud and abuse 
problems,'' House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va., 
said in response to the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, many of the same types of fraud found  
in traditional Medicaid programs -- kickbacks, billing for services 
not rendered and duplicate billing -- also exist in managed care 
plans. In addition, it said, Medicaid managed care plans are open 
to such abuses as enrollment fraud or failing to provide necessary 
covered medical care to recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Medicaid's traditional fee-for-service method of paying  
doctor and hospital bills, state agencies must have a unit that 
conducts post-payment reviews of claims to look for any 
aberrations. But for states with special waivers that enable them 
to place Medicaid recipients in managed care plans, there are few 
guidelines that spell out which party is responsible, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Medicaid state agencies indicated that they do not believe  
it is their responsibility to detect and refer cases of fraud. But 
some of the managed care plans said they believed that it was the 
state's role -- and not theirs -- to detect potential fraud and 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The report highlighted the efforts of Tennessee and Arizona for  
proactive efforts to detect fraud in Medicaid managed care plans. 
Those states conduct training for managed care plans and meet with 
the organizations regularly to discuss potential fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Arizona and Tennessee, the states studied were Delaware,  
Hawaii, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island and 
Vermont.

<HEADLINE> Broker Vanishes With Clients' $3B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- A money manager has vanished with as  
much as $3 billion in clients' money, leaving behind a things-to-do 
list (item No. 1: ``Launder money'') and astrological charts 
designed to answer such pressing questions as ``Will I go to 
prison?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Frankel, 44, has not been seen since May 5, when an  
automatic alarm called firefighters to his high-security mansion in 
this rich New York City suburb. They found a blazing file cabinet 
and two fireplaces stuffed with burning documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, insurance company regulators said Frankel's  
unlicensed brokerage -- apparently run out of the Greenwich mansion 
-- had siphoned off money from a dozen small insurance companies in 
five states. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies, based in Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee,  
Missouri and Arkansas, were placed in receivership when they could 
not account for assets invested with Frankel's Liberty National 
Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators said the insurers are missing at least $218 million,  
but a lawsuit filed by some of the companies put the loss at $915 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing is as much as $1.98 billion from the St. Francis of  
Assisi Foundation, which was established by Frankel in the British 
Virgin Islands last August. It was supposedly a charity to help 
sick kids, but investigators suspect it was only a front for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in Bridgeport has been investigating  
Frankel since mid-May, the Greenwich Time reported last month. A 
sealed warrant has been issued for his arrest, the New York Daily 
News reported Tuesday, citing unidentified law enforcement sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the papers seized after the fire was a handwritten list of  
tasks, the first of which was ``Launder money.'' The second item on 
the list: ``Get $ to Israel get it back in,'' according to a May 25 
FBI affidavit filed in federal court in Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
	Also seized, according to the affidavit, were personalized  
astrological charts answering such questions as: ``Will I go to 
prison?'' ``Should I leave?'' and ``Will I be safe?'' The affidavit 
does not indicate what the stars held for him. 
</P>
<P>
	No attorney has identified himself as representing Frankel, and  
family members in Ohio, including Frankel's mother, told The Blade 
of Toledo that they had not heard from him in several weeks. He 
apparently was not married. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials said Frankel used several aliases,  
including the name of his bodyguard, after being barred from 
trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the insurance companies are owned by Thunor Trust, which  
lists Tennessee-based businessman John Hackney as trustee. Hackney 
did not return a call Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the months before the fire, Frankel spent more than $1  
million on shopping sprees at Baccarat, Tiffany and Gianni Versace 
and trips to Rome, Geneva and London, according to financial 
records obtained by the Time. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel's stone mansion is in Greenwich's ``backcountry,'' a  
secluded area of multimillion-dollar estates, woods and horse 
trails. Since the fire, the long, hilly driveway that leads to his 
home and several other houses has been guarded by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, a native of Toledo, Ohio, had converted his $3 million  
home into a maze of offices with more than 80 computers and 
wide-screen televisions tuned to financial news channels. Frankel 
also owned a home next door. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors complained repeatedly about cars coming and going day  
and night. But the activity only increased, said Phil Russell, a 
lawyer who represents three neighbors on the cul-de-sac. Russell 
said Frankel did not socialize with his neighbors and never told 
them what kind of business he was in. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and federal prosecutors in Connecticut refused to  
comment on the case Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Cisneros' Ex-Mistress Takes Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ex-mistress of former Housing Secretary  
Henry Cisneros has testified that she began surreptitiously taping 
their phone conversations as the relationship soured and she became 
concerned he would not live up to his commitment to support her 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Jones' motives in making the recordings are under scrutiny  
as Cisneros' lawyers seek to quash use of the tapes at his 
September trial on charges that he conspired to conceal from the 
FBI the scope of the payments. 
</P>
<P>
	They argue the tapes are inadmissible on two grounds: Because  
Ms. Jones altered some of the recordings and because she had an 
illegal intent in making them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is (what) the government has advised the court  
already. ... They were tampered with. End of story,'' Cisneros 
lawyer Barry Simon said at a pre-trial hearing Monday that appears 
likely to stretch into the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to use the tapes to corroborate witness  
testimony that Cisneros conspired with Ms. Jones to conceal more 
than $264,000 in ``hush money'' payments to her. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, who served as HUD secretary from 1993 to 1996, was  
indicted in December 1997 on 18 felony counts of conspiracy, 
obstructing justice and making false statements to the FBI. He has 
pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the witness stand Monday, Ms. Jones said she began the  
taping after Cisneros refused to sign an agreement outlining his 
financial support. She also said she taped him out of concern that 
he was feeding erroneous information to reporters about the status 
of their highly publicized relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	As Cisneros came under consideration for a Cabinet post and  
talked to Bill Clinton's advisers in late 1992, Ms. Jones said she 
became increasingly worried that the payments would cease. She said 
Cisneros told her Clinton officials had cautioned him the support 
``looked like hush money, blackmail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She acknowledged threatening Cisneros by saying she would  
publicize the payments: ``I knew I was threatening him; I didn't 
ever think about it in legal terms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Jackowski acknowledged that Ms. Jones deleted  
the threats as well as passages of a sexual nature or dealing with 
other people. But he said only five of the 33 tapes prosecutors are 
seeking to use at trial were altered. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones ran afoul of the Cisneros prosecutors and was put in  
prison in part because she misrepresented the tapes as originals. 
</P>
<P>
	She is serving a 3 1/2-year prison sentence at a federal medical  
facility in Fort Worth after pleading guilty last year to 28 counts 
involving fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and obstruction. 
Barrett's office has suggested a willingness to support a reduction 
in her sentence and dismiss two pending counts depending on her 
level of cooperation at Cisneros' trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on her 50th birthday, Ms. Jones said she was  
``devastated'' by media reports in the fall of 1988 of her affair 
with Cisneros, then mayor of San Antonio. Her husband filed for 
divorce and the publicity cost her career as a political fund 
raiser, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones said she and Cisneros began discussing financial  
support for her after he returned to his wife in late 1989. ``He 
knew what a position I was in. I didn't have a way to support my 
daughter and I didn't see a way to do it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Cisneros acknowledged providing financial support,  
prosecutors contend he falsely told the FBI during his Cabinet 
background check that he never paid her more than $2,500 at one 
time or more than $10,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that he paid her more than $264,000  
between 1990 and 1993, in installments as high as $15,000.

<HEADLINE> Wife Accused of Hammer Beating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSSIER CITY, La. (AP) -- A woman, her daughter and niece took a  
hammer to her abusive husband's head after giving him horse 
tranquilizers in an attempt to kill him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The women gave Michael Glass, 33, some of the tranquilizer in a  
drink and injected more into him once he was unconscious, police 
spokesman Mike Halphen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when they began beating him about the head,'' police  
spokesman Mike Halphen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glass woke up, ran to a neighbor's house and called police. He  
was recovering in a hospital Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brenda Glass, 38, her daughter, Brandy Jordan, 20, and Stephanie  
Jackson, 27, told police they wanted to kill Glass because he 
abused his wife, Halphen said.

	They were booked on charges of conspiracy and attempted murder  
and held.

	In 1972, President Nixon and White House chief of staff H.R.  
Haldeman discussed a plan to use the CIA to obstruct the FBI's 
Watergate investigation. (Revelation of the tape recording of this 
conversation sparked Nixon's resignation in 1974.) 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, all 329 people aboard an Air-India Boeing 747 were

<HEADLINE> Unlicensed Insurance Broker Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Authorities are searching for an  
unlicensed money manager who vanished, allegedly with millions of 
dollars in clients' money, and left behind burned, shredded 
documents and astrological charts. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates of the amount of money missing range from $218 million  
to $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Frankel has been missing since May 5, when firefighters  
went to his high-security mansion and found a blazing file cabinet 
and two fireplaces stuffed with burning documents. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in Bridgeport has been investigating  
Frankel and his brokerage since mid-May, the Greenwich Time 
reported last month. The New York Daily News reported today, citing 
unidentified law enforcement sources, that a sealed warrant had 
been issued for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, insurance company regulators said Frankel's  
unlicensed brokerage was responsible for the disappearance of 
assets from a dozen small insurance firms in five states. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies, based in Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee,  
Missouri and Arkansas, were placed in receivership when they were 
unable to account for assets that had been invested with Frankel's 
Liberty National Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI affidavit said: ``Frankel systematically drained these  
assets through various financial accounts and transferred them into 
accounts in and outside this country under his control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say the insurance companies are missing at least $218  
million, but a lawsuit filed by some of the companies puts the loss 
at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing is as much as $1.98 billion from the St. Francis of  
Assisi Foundation, which investigators say was established by 
Frankel in the British Virgin Islands last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, 44, had turned his $3 million home into a warren of  
offices with nearly 100 computers and wide-screen televisions tuned 
to financial news channels, according to court papers filed by the 
FBI. Some of the rooms had electronic locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the papers seized was a handwritten list of tasks such as  
``launder money,'' investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also seized, according to the FBI affidavit, were personalized  
astrological charts answering such questions as: ``Will I go to 
prison?'' ``Should I leave?'' and ``Will I be safe?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials have said Frankel used several aliases  
after being barred from trading by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in 1992.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros manager Larry Dierker was expected  
to be released from a hospital Wednesday, eight days after surgeons 
removed tangled blood vessels in his brain that caused a seizure.

to make a full recovery and return to the dugout sometime in July. 
An angiogram after the operation showed no more abnormal blood 
vessels. 
</P>

	Dierker was the third member of the Astros staff to become ill  
this season. First-base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 
because of an irregular heartbeat and returned last week. Hitting 
coach Tom McCraw left May 16 for prostate cancer treatment.

<HEADLINE> Court Limits ADA Protections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court excluded more than 100  
million Americans with physical impairments from the protection of 
a key anti-discrimination law Tuesday, ruling the law generally 
does not cover people with poor eyesight or other correctable 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court said the same law, the Americans with Disabilities  
Act, may require states to take mentally disabled people out of 
hospitals and let them live in homelike settings. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving toward Wednesday's conclusion of its 1998-99 term, the  
nation's highest court offered dramatic new meaning -- in four 
separate decisions -- to a federal law best known for requiring 
handicap access ramps at public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The rulings, however, did not answer all questions about the  
1990 law's scope. Future court battles are certain. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the four disputes decided Tuesday were viewed as a  
legal watershed by advocates for the disabled, who were outraged by 
three rulings affecting American workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These decisions create the absurd result of a person being  
disabled enough to be fired from a job but not disabled enough to 
challenge the firing,'' said Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown University 
law professor. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stephen Bokat, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce general counsel,  
said the rulings offered welcome shelter for employers flooded by 
employee lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means that those with true disabilities will continue to be  
covered, but people with easily correctable conditions will not be 
considered disabled,'' Bokat said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three rulings, the court said people with correctable  
physical impairments generally cannot rely on the ADA to sue their 
employers over alleged discrimination. Otherwise, the court said, 
more than 160 million Americans would be protected by the law, not 
just an estimated 43 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On the rights of people in state mental hospitals, the court  
fashioned a narrow, middle-of-the-road decision that left both 
sides of the conflict claiming victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the 1990 law requires states to place the  
mentally disabled in the ``most integrated setting'' appropriate, 
but only after ``taking into account the resources available to the 
state and the needs of others with mental disabilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no way to know how many of the 70,000 mentally  
disabled people living in state hospitals nationwide might be 
affected by the ruling in a Georgia case. 
</P>
<P>
	ADAPT, a national disability rights group based in Denver,  
praised the ruling for reinforcing ``the fundamental intent of the 
ADA, which is to prevent discrimination and promote the integration 
of people with disabilities into our communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Downing, a Georgia assistant attorney general, said her  
state could live with a ruling that ``doesn't appear to be too 
burdensome.'' She noted that the court, among other things, did not 
condemn a state's practice of keeping eligible people on a 
community-placement waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	She also praised the justices for ruling that a state's overall  
budget and its commitment to all mentally disabled people must be 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court's 6-3 majority  
in the Georgia case. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and 
Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia dissented. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's three rulings on the ADA's applicability for people  
whose conditions are readily corrected with medication or devices 
such as eyeglasses doomed lawsuits that alleged illegal bias 
against two nearsighted pilots, a truck driver almost blind in one 
eye and a mechanic with high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-bias law prohibits employers from discriminating  
against a ``qualified individual with a disability'' because of 
that disability. 
</P>
<P>
	A qualified person is defined as one who can perform a job when  
given reasonable accommodation, and a disability is defined as 
condition that substantially limits a major life activity. The law 
also protects people who are discriminated against because they are 
``regarded as'' having a disability. 
</P>
<P>
	The court announced its main ruling in the case of two  
nearsighted Colorado sisters, both regional airline pilots, who 
sued after their job applications with United Air Lines were 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The determination of whether a person is protected by the law,  
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the 7-2 court, ``should be 
made with reference to measures that mitigate the individual's 
impairment, including, in this instance, eyeglasses and contact 
lenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court concluded that the two sisters are not disabled as  
defined by the law, and therefore could not invoke the law to sue 
United. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor noted that Congress, in enacting the law, made  
reference to 43 million disabled Americans. If it had intended to 
include everyone with a correctable impairment, Congress would have 
used a number closer to 160 million, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 43 million figure reflects an understanding that those  
whose impairments are largely corrected by medication or other 
devices are not 'disabled' within the meaning of the ADA,'' 
O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen G. Breyer dissented.  
Writing for the two, Stevens -- the only justice with a pilot's 
license -- accused the court having ``crabbed vision'' and adopting 
a ``miserly construction'' of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	An identical 7-2 lineup ruled against a Kansas truck mechanic  
with high blood pressure. The court, with Justice David H. Souter 
writing for it, ruled unanimously against an Oregon truck driver 
who is virtually blind in one eye.

<HEADLINE> Swiss at Loss After Losing 2006 Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- In a national bout of soul-searching following the  
unexpected loss of the 2006 Winter Olympics, Switzerland has 
concluded that it is isolated and unloved as never before. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend decision by the International Olympic Committee to  
award the 2006 Games to the Italian city of Turin rather than Swiss 
front-runner Sion has unleashed anger and accusations of dirty 
tricks in the scandal-ridden International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is also seen as a political rebuke for the Swiss, whose  
international reputation has been tarnished by allegations of 
wartime collusion with the Nazis. There is a growing realization 
that the small Alpine nation -- which champions its neutrality and 
is a member of neither the United Nations nor European Union -- must 
change its ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never even dreamed that we had such a bad reputation,''  
Sports Minister Adolf Ogi told the Le Temps newspaper in an 
interview published Tuesday. ``We have a strong economic presence 
worldwide, but politically we are alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard delegates say they wanted the Swiss to lose. People  
don't like Switzerland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of neutral Switzerland's World War II role and its  
treatment of Holocaust victims' assets has led to frayed relations 
with the United States and other countries. Jewish groups have 
accused it of profiting from the Holocaust, by retaining the assets 
of Jews slain by the Nazis and acting as Adolf Hitler's banker, 
trafficking in gold stolen by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, after much foot-dragging, Switzerland's two biggest  
banks agreed to pay $1.25 billion in an out-of-court settlement of 
Holocaust survivors' claims for wartime losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Ogi, like most other commentators, said the overwhelming  
53-36 Olympic vote in favor of Turin was principally a backlash 
against Swiss IOC member Marc Hodler. It was Hodler who blew the 
whistle on wrong-doing by Salt Lake City and forced the 
Swiss-headquartered Olympic movement into an anti-corruption drive 
which forced out nine members and cost the rest their privileges. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, a shaken Ogi conceded that Switzerland's image  
problem stemmed from ``our attitude.'' Numerous IOC members and 
other Olympic officials have said the loss was as much because the 
Swiss were perceived as arrogant and overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We claim to be the best. We play at being school masters and  
teaching others lessons. We overestimate ourselves,'' said Ogi, who 
is also Swiss vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite initial concern about costs and the environment,  
Switzerland's Olympic bid was remarkable because of the popular 
enthusiasm and financial sponsorship it gathered in this 
traditionally cautious country. The red-and-white Sion logo was 
emblazoned over trains, buses, bottles of wine, chocolate and even 
toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC evaluation commission earlier this year gave Sion a much  
better rating than Turin or other rivals. After losing out to Salt 
Lake City for the 2002 Games, the Swiss brimmed with confidence and 
planned a huge party in Sion's main square to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	There were hopes the Games would create up to 15,000 new jobs  
and revitalize the tourist industry in the southern Valais Alps. 
The Games were also seen as a vital chance of repairing the public 
relations damage inflicted by the Holocaust controversy. The mass 
influx of visitors was also expected to make the notoriously 
insular Swiss more open to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the nation is geographically in the heart of Europe,  
voters in 1992 rejected government plans to join a lose trade pact, 
putting a formal membership application for the European Union on 
indefinite hold. 
</P>
<P>
	After tortuous negotiations, Swiss ministers signed an agreement  
Monday for freer trade in sectors like agriculture, transport, 
labor and research. But diehard defenders of Swiss neutrality have 
indicated they will try to drum up enough support to hold a 
national referendum to throw out the accords. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we are almost European,'' was the headline comment in the  
mass-selling Blick newspaper Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the paper topped its front page with a survey on ``Why the  
world doesn't love us'' in which its foreign correspondents 
canvassed foreign opinions about the Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
	From Italy came the view that the Swiss are racist; from France  
came the notion that all Swiss were ``stinking rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The British criticized the Swiss for being boring and  
obsessively tidy. Israelis found them anti-Semitic and ``a good 
sleeping pill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans said Switzerland was a ``sterile picture postcard''  
inhabited by colorless people always looking for their own 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pedantic and humorless. We are greedy profiteers. We  
are arrogant. We are bad losers,'' summarized Blick. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how the world sees us.''

<HEADLINE> Turner Buys Another Large Ranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Ted Turner, bison guy, has bought another  
large ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The media mogul paid $6.8 million earlier this month for 34,186  
acres of bison grazing land straddling the Nebraska-South Dakota 
line, said Russ Miller, who manages Turner's ranches. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said Turner admires the ``good grass, good water and good  
people'' of the Sandhills. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we're doing is confirming what we said when we first  
bought land there: This is good country,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the CNN founder owns about 1.6 million acres of  
ranchland, mostly in New Mexico and Montana. He also owns one of 
the largest commercials bison herds in the nation -- about 17,000 
head.

<HEADLINE> Phil Mickelson's Wife Gives Birth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- It's a good thing Phil Mickelson didn't  
go into a playoff at the U.S. Open after all. 
</P>
<P>
	His baby, Amanda Brynn, was born one day after he finished  
second in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Mickelson gave birth on Monday night to the healthy,  
7-pound, 4-ounce girl. Mother and daughter were doing fine, 
Mickelson spokesman Mike Biggs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson, who already has won 13 times on the PGA Tour but has  
never won a major championship, wasn't even sure he was going to 
play in the U.S. Open until last Tuesday, when doctors estimated 
that his wife would carry their first child for at least another 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he had a beeper in his bag and vowed he would leave if  
his wife went into labor -- even in the final round or a playoff 
with a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson was leading by one stroke with three holes to play  
Sunday at Pinehurst No. 2 until Payne Stewart rallied to win the 
U.S. Open by making a 15-foot par putt on the 72nd hole. Otherwise, 
he and Mickelson would have played an 18-hole playoff on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Biggs said Mickelson's wife went into labor about 3 p.m. EDT --  
or about the time Stewart and Mickelson would have been making the 
turn.

<HEADLINE> John Adams Letter Goes for $575,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A letter written by John Adams three days before  
the signing of the Declaration of Independence, predicting ``a 
great expence of blood'' to secure freedom from England, sold at 
auction Tuesday for a record $635,000. 
</P>
<P>
	An anonymous buyer captured the letter in spirited bidding  
against a New York documents dealer representing an unidentified 
museum. The price was a record for a letter by Adams, the 
Revolutionary War figure and second president, and a record for any 
signer of the Declaration of Independence. The seller was not 
identified, Sotheby's said. 
</P>
<P>
	The July 1, 1776, letter was sent to Archibald Bullock, a former  
member of the Continental Congress from Georgia. In it, Adams 
refers to the discussion about the Declaration of Independence -- 
due to begin in Philadelphia that day -- as ``the greatest debate of 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``May Heaven prosper, the newborn Republic, and make it more  
glorious than any former Republicks have been,'' he wrote in the 
letter, complete with idiosyncratic spelling and capitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams further wrote: ``The object is great which We have in  
View, and We must expect a great expence of blood to obtain it. But 
We Should always remember that a free Constitution of civil 
Government cannot be purchased at too dear a rate as there is 
nothing, on this side (of) the New Jerusalem, of equal importance 
to Mankind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sotheby's spokesman Emma Cunningham said the previous record for  
an Adams letter, set in 1993, was $380,000 for a 1775 plan for new 
state governments. The previous record was for any letter written 
by a Declaration of Independence signer was $440,000 for a letter 
written on July 4, 1776, by Caesar Rodney. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Kaller, a dealer in Americana who lost the bidding for the  
latest Adams letter, called the document ``certainly worth what it 
went for, and probably worth a lot more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All prices include a buyer's premium, on top of the bid price,  
paid to the auction house.

<HEADLINE> Kids Get a Kick Out of U.S. Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOCKPORT, Ill. (AP) -- As goalie Saskia Webber walked toward a  
house at the SOS Children's Village, deep in discussion with 
8-year-old Tevin about her new red-white-and-blue sneakers, she 
spotted Jon racing around, trying to get autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, I hear you're a pretty good artist,'' she said as the boy  
nodded. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-hour later, Webber and a few others from the U.S. women's  
World Cup team huddled around a table as Jon brought out a folder 
of drawings. As the women oohed and aahed at the pictures -- there 
were Power Rangers, Mario from the Nintendo game and a Tasmanian 
Devil that looked like it came straight from the cartoon -- Jon hung 
back, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought they were just going to come over and look at  
things,'' he said. ``I didn't know they were going to play with 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American women are on a quest to regain the World Cup,  
soccer's most prestigious title and one they lost four years ago to 
Norway. With one victory already behind them, they're gearing up 
for their game against Nigeria on Thursday at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a hectic time, with training and travel taking up most of  
their days. Yet nine team members and two assistant coaches took 
the morning off Tuesday to visit the SOS Children's Village, a home 
for abused and neglected children southwest of Chicago. SOS 
Children's Villages International is the official charity of FIFA, 
soccer's world governing body. Children from the Lockport village 
will lead players onto the field Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It puts things in perspective,'' Webber said. ``I don't think  
our team gets caught up in things, but you see how fortunate we 
are. We realize how much playing for the team is a gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SOS Children's Village, one of two in the United States, is  
home to 40 children. Their stories aren't pretty, with most 
becoming wards of the state because of abuse or neglect. They've 
bounced around from foster home to foster home, averaging six 
placements before they get to the village. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's goal is to keep families together, so they live in  
individual homes with a house parent. It's as normal an existence 
as possible, with the village set up to look like any other 
subdivision -- complete with a playground behind the houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of these kids come in on a survival basis,'' said Bill  
Mathis, executive director of SOS Children's Village Illinois. 
``Two days before one of the most important games of their lives, 
and they come to see kids that have been abused and abandoned. It's 
an exciting thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the players arrived, a group of 10 children decked out in  
soccer jerseys was waiting. The players handed out team photos and 
pins and then trooped around the grounds, wandering through the 
houses, signing autographs and playing with the children. 
</P>
<P>
	One little boy grabbed forward Danielle Fotopoulos and took her  
to show off his room. Anthony brought out his book of awards from 
school. Calvin scrambled to get next to midfielder Tiffany Roberts 
when the children took a picture with the team -- and was clearly 
disappointed when he was aced out by someone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the children are wards of the state, they can only be  
identified by their first names. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love seeing kids have smiles on their faces,'' Roberts said.  
``To know we can bring them out is awesome. Any impact we can make 
on young children is important. I think we can inspire kids in many 
ways, and it's not just younger girls. It's younger boys, as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While most of the players on hand were reserves, the entire team  
wanted to be there, forward Shannon MacMillan said. But coach Tony 
DiCicco wanted his starters to rest, so they had to stay back at 
the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't see this as a chore or something we have to do,''  
Roberts said. ``It makes us feel good, and at the same time, we're 
making them feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Take Sharon, 11. She and her sister have been reading soccer  
magazines for the last few years and are big fans of defender 
Brandi Chastain. When Sharon heard the team was coming to visit, 
she figured one player might show up. She couldn't believe it when 
she saw everyone climbing off the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like, `Wow.' I'm really excited about meeting them  
before Thursday,'' Sharon said. ``Now we won't be shy. We can say, 
`Hi,' and maybe they can call out our names.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the team left, the players and kids were fast  
friends. There were hugs and high-fives all around. Tevin and his 
7-year-old brother, Kevin, were already planning where to put the 
team photo in their room. And Tevin plans to wear his new pin all 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Standing on the podium is the easy part. All of our success is  
founded on the moments people aren't watching us,'' said Lauren 
Gregg, an assistant coach. ``It doesn't matter to them that we're 
soccer players. It's that they matter enough to us for us to come 
see them, see their houses, look at their artwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came here to brighten their days. But I'll go back with  
their smiles and eyes in my heart and I'll feel good.''

<HEADLINE>  It's Twin Towers vs. Twin Terrors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If San Antonio has Twin Towers in David Robinson  
and Tim Duncan, then New York has Twin Terrors in Latrell Sprewell 
and Allan Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Me and Allan can pressure defenses,'' Sprewell said.  
</P>
<P>
	That they do.  
</P>
<P>
	Houston (34) and Sprewell (24) combined for 58 points in the  
Knicks' 89-81 Game 2 victory that left New York trailing the 
best-of-7 series 2-1. They are the only Knicks averaging in double 
figures in the series, Houston at 24 points a game and Sprewell at 
23. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of their success has been getting the ball in the  
right place at the right time. Houston was able to do that 
repeatedly in Game 2, nailing midrange jump shots to keep the 
Knicks in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 15-to-20 footer has always been my strength,'' he said.  
``Shooting off the dribble, it's kind of paying off. The way the 
game is played now, that shot can be very effective. The great 
scorers, Walt Frazier, Earl Monroe, Oscar Robertson lived off that 
midrange shot. It's something I can be successful with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, on the other hand, darts and drives to the basket, and  
is more effective in the open court transition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they pose problems for defenses, especially on those  
occasions when Sprewell plays point guard alongside Houston in the 
backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we go big in the backcourt, we can force them to double,''  
Sprewell said. 
</P>
<P>
	As effective as Sprewell's open court game has been, the Knicks'  
success more and more often revolves around Houston, especially 
with leading scorer Patrick Ewing sidelined because of a torn 
Achilles' tendon. Since Ewing went out after the second game of the 
Eastern Conference finals, Houston has become New York's No. 1 
scoring option. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a good feel for the game in the sense of assessing  
spatial relationship with the defender,'' Spurs coach Gregg 
Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson put Houston's success in less mathematical terms.  
</P>
<P>
	``He seems very relaxed out there, just having fun,'' he said.  
``He was making tough shots and looked like he felt good. When a 
guy gets in that place, it's very dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston hopes so.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to be consistent,'' he said. ``I don't want to  
score 30 points one night and 10 the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consistency has sometimes been missing from Sprewell's game.  
Scoreless in the third quarter of Game 3, he had 10 points in the 
fourth. After hitting 10 straight free throws in Game 2, he missed 
four of five attempts during one key stretch in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, both players were key elements of the victory.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy sees an approach in Houston that was not  
there in his first two seasons in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``His hunger is different now,'' Van Gundy said. ``He was  
content before to score his 20 points. Now, he has a continuing 
hunger to score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston confirmed his coach's assessment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's right,'' he said. ``Look at the great scorers.  
They're not happy with 20. If they have a great start, they want to 
keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early on, I was a little unselfish. I found there was a way to  
do both. It hasn't happened overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston said his evolution was natural. He was signed to a $54  
million free agent contract as a scorer and now he scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our job, to put the ball in the basket,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Then he thought about the name of his position -- shooting guard.  
</P>
<P>
	``The first part of the position is `shooting,''' he said.  
``That's what we do best.''

score 30 points one night and 10 the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consistency has sometimes been missing from Sprewell's game.  
Scoreless in the third quarter of Game 3, he had 10 points in the 
fourth. After hitting 10 straight free throws in Game 2, he missed 
four of five attempts during one key stretch in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, both players were key elements of the victory.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy sees an approach in Houston that was not  
there in his first two seasons in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``His hunger is different now,'' Van Gundy said. ``He was  
content before to score his 20 points. Now, he has a continuing 
hunger to score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston confirmed his coach's assessment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's right,'' he said. ``Look at the great scorers.  
They're not happy with 20. If they have a great start, they want to 
keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early on, I was a little unselfish. I found there was a way to  
do both. It hasn't happened overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston said his evolution was natural. He was signed to a $54  
million free agent contract as a scorer and now he scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our job, to put the ball in the basket,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Then he thought about the name of his position -- shooting guard.  
</P>
<P>
	``The first part of the position is `shooting,''' he said.  
``That's what we do best.''

<HEADLINE> New Name For Tennis Fans: Dokic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Remember this name: Jelena Dokic.  
</P>
<P>
	Casual tennis fans may not know her, but this 16-year-old  
qualifier can play. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, she rocked Wimbledon with a 6-2, 6-0 victory over  
No. 1 Martina Hingis in one of the great upsets in tournament 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still can't believe I've beaten her,'' Dokic said.  
</P>
<P>
	The world's top junior last year and the defending U.S. Open  
junior champion, Dokic had already beaten three top 20 players this 
year. Among them was Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the winner of four 
Grand Slams. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis became No. 4. She also became only the third top-seeded  
woman in Wimbledon history to lose her opening match. 
</P>
<P>
	True, Dokic entered Wimbledon as a qualifier, but only because  
at 16 she's limited by the WTA Tour to 10 tournaments and four 
Grand Slams. 
</P>
<P>
	True, she's ranked only No. 129 but next week she'll soar into  
the top 50. And the top 10 can't be far off. 
</P>
<P>
	Dokic (pronounced DAH-kick) lives in Sydney, Australia,  
emigrating in 1994 with her family from war-torn Yugoslavia. She 
turned professional late last year and is coached by her father, 
Damir, and former professional Wally Masur. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father made headlines a few weeks ago when he was ejected  
from a grass-court match in Birmingham, England, for abusing 
officials. Outside the grounds he was arrested -- and later released 
-- for stopping traffic and throwing himself on the hood of a 
passing car. 
</P>
<P>
	Warned he'd be under surveillance at Wimbledon, he watched  
Tuesday in near silence as his daughter routed Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
	Dokic forced Hingis to stay deep and delivered an assortment of  
two-handed backhands, searing forehands and deft drop shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Dokic, who is 5-foot-6 and athletic and quick, won 11 straight  
games in one stretch. Up 4-0 in the second set and waiting for a 
dispirited Hingis to serve the fifth, she bobbed up and down at the 
baseline like a boxer warming up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because I beat Hingis, doesn't mean I have to come out  
and win the tournament now. ... I have to keep my feet on the 
ground,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five months ago in the Australian Open, Hingis brushed off Dokic  
6-1, 6-2 in the third round. In the French Open, Dokic was ousted 
in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude of Tuesday's upset even got to her boisterous  
father. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he said to her afterward, she replied, ``He was out  
of words.''

<HEADLINE> Nuke Scientists To Take Lie Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As many as 5,000 nuclear scientists and other  
officials with top-secret clearances at the Energy Department will 
be given lie detector tests as part of a broader program to beef up 
security and anti-espionage programs, department officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was expected to provide details  
of the polygraph testing program today at a Senate hearing where he 
also was to resist broader restructuring of his department -- a 
reorganization that critics say would give weapons programs greater 
autonomy and safeguard nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Senate committees -- Armed Services, Intelligence, Energy,  
and Governmental Affairs -- were scheduled to hear from Richardson 
as well as former Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, chairman of 
a presidential advisory panel that last week called for a dramatic 
reshuffling of the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudman's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, in a report highly  
critical of security at the department, urged creation of a 
semiautonomous agency within the department to run the nuclear 
weapons programs, including the weapons labs. A Senate proposal, 
likely to be offered within weeks, will be fashioned after the 
Rudman recommendation and could be voted on by the full Senate 
before the summer recess, Senate sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has called such a move unwise and argued that his  
initiatives -- streamlining counterintelligence and security and 
giving those offices more clout -- will protect America's nuclear 
secrets. Part of the security push will be a wide use of polygraph 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward J. Curran, the DOE's director of the counterintelligence,  
said Monday that he anticipates as many as 5,000 nuclear weapons 
scientists and other employees in sensitive jobs will be tested, 
some possibly as early as August. Curran, a veteran FBI agent and 
counterintelligence expert, said he was the first to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing program is expected to be in full swing by  
September, with more than 200 tests a month, or 2,500 a year, 
Curran said. So far 56 counterintelligence officers, including some 
at the nuclear weapons laboratories, have been tested voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulation covering the tests will be published in the  
Federal Register possibly this week, followed by a 30-day comment 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first time any agency outside of the Central  
Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency has engaged in 
widespread use of polygraph tests on workers. The FBI uses the 
devices to screen prospective employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of testing thousands of workers, including most of  
the nuclear weapons scientists at the research labs, has raised 
concern among scientists at the labs. Some worry about the 
reliability of the polygraph and the possibility of career-ending 
``false positive'' findings. Others fear the department probing 
their private lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials at the weapons labs -- Los Alamos, Sandia and  
Livermore -- are worried the push for such widespread testing might 
drive topflight scientists away to universities where they need not 
deal with such scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Curran said the tests, which will be administered by  
contractors, will be ``very focused'' and the core questions 
limited to ``deal only with espionage'' and not personal or 
``lifestyle'' matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been very careful that we have everybody's concerns  
addressed. This is a technique that is used in the interest of 
protecting national security. The more focused it is, the better 
the results,'' Curran said.

<HEADLINE> Carolina Coach Signs Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Is Paul Maurice the next Scotty Bowman?  
</P>
<P>
	The Carolina Hurricanes would like to think so, announcing a  
three-year contract extension Tuesday for Maurice that would put 
him second behind Bowman in current NHL coaching tenure with the 
same team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to think that Paul can be Scotty Bowman someday,  
and that people still want him to coach when he's in his 60s,'' 
Carolina general manager Jim Rutherford said, referring to the 
Detroit coach. ``You can ask Scotty Bowman, he's a better coach 
today than when he first started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rutherford had a good comeback when informed that Bowman has won  
eight Stanley Cups, and Maurice none. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at least eight years away from that in Carolina,'' he  
said, joking. 
</P>
<P>
	All kidding aside, Rutherford believes Maurice, 32, is ``ahead  
of his time'' as an NHL coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice, 128-143-45 in four seasons, has been a part of owner  
Peter Karmanos' Compuware hockey organization for 14 years, joining 
the then-Hartford Whalers as an assistant coach in June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul started coaching in his 20s. Most guys serve their  
apprenticeship in their 30s and 40s,'' Rutherford said. ``It's not 
an age factor, it's an experience factor, and he's gained a lot of 
experience, maybe more experience than any other coach in 
professional sports in the last three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported a month ago that Maurice, one of  
the NHL's lowest-paid coaches, would be offered an extension worth 
between $1.2 million and $1.5 million over three years. The death 
of defenseman Steve Chiasson set contract talks back several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice and his coaching staff implemented a trapping system  
last season that allowed the team to capture the Southeast Division 
with a 34-30-18 record and the franchise's first playoff berth 
since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year when the players come back we want to see  
improvement and I would think the players would expect the same 
from their coach,'' Maurice said late Tuesday in a telephone 
interview from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the Canadian media predicted Maurice would be the first  
NHL coach fired last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't thinking a whole lot about it,'' Maurice said when  
asked about his job security. ``I had conditioned myself not to 
think about getting fired or staying -- just do the job and see. 
What I do for a living is so subjective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina was in first place for 175 days of the 192-day  
schedule, and Carolina's 86 points were the second-most in the 20 
years of the franchise. The Hurricanes lost the Boston series 4-2 
in the opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that professional sports is too quick to blame  
coaches, especially in our situation with the circumstances that 
we've had with leaving a city in one year, playing in an interim 
facility and city for two more years,'' Rutherford said. ``Paul did 
such an exceptional job to keep our team focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Maurice's failures this past season was a power-play unit  
that scored just 11 percent of the time -- last in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the coach has to take some responsibility for the  
power play -- that's his job,'' Rutherford said. ``But sometimes you 
get too many different opinions (from players), and we had too many 
different opinions on our power play. We've got to correct that.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Says Competition Is Fierce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Microsoft Corp. contended Tuesday it is  
awash in a raging sea of competition so intense that no federal 
intervention is necessary to preserve the nation's booming 
high-tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat of future competition requires Microsoft to  
innovate rapidly, to evangelize, to invest in improvements,'' said 
the company's final witness, economist Richard Schmalensee. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee told U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson  
that Microsoft is challenged by a newly resurgent Apple Computer 
Inc. and an upstart software movement surrounding the Linux 
computer operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was clearly impressed with Schmalensee's depiction of a  
new generation of so-called ``server-based'' software -- programs 
that will be delivered across emerging high-speed Internet 
connections rather than relying on Microsoft's dominant Windows 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you do that?'' asked Jackson, adding later: ``The concept  
to me sounds very attractive. I can't imagine why ISVs (independent 
software vendors) aren't developing applications in droves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee reminded the judge of testimony last week from  
another Microsoft witness, software executive Gordon Eubanks, who 
said the Internet has become ``the platform of choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's top lawyer for the case, David Boies,  
was expected to begin questioning Schmalensee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies said outside the courtroom that Microsoft was trying to  
muddy the waters by drawing attention away from the dominance of 
its Windows software, which runs most of the world's personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is operating systems,'' Boies said. ``Things that  
compete with operating systems are other operating systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft also told Jackson on Tuesday that it faces more  
new competition from the recent $10 billion merger between America 
Online Inc., the world's largest Internet provider, and Netscape 
Communications Corp., the Internet software pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee cited internal AOL documents revealing plans ``to  
absorb more share of computing time, with the goal of becoming 
users' de facto environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL does not plan to produce an operating system, but it plans  
to be effectively the operating system,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee also described investments by companies that produce  
rival technologies, such as Sun Microsystems Inc., saying those 
expenditures don't match the government's claims that Microsoft is 
an entrenched monopolist that won't be overthrown without a judge's 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either Sun is throwing away money, or it has a rather  
different view of the world than plaintiffs,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Feds Authorize Cuban Wire Transfers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The federal government has authorized Western Union  
to handle wire transfers of money to Cuba, making it easier for 
exiles to send funds to friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said Monday that Western Union will be able  
to process the transfers starting July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Under new federal rules, anyone in the United States can send up  
to $300 every three months, but not to senior Cuban government or 
party officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Western Union previously had been permitted to handle cash  
transfers only for emergency expenses or emigration costs. 
</P>
<P>
	For other transfers, Cuban exiles have relied on a network of  
agencies with links to businesses in Cuba. These agencies could set 
their own price, but Western Union will charge $29 for sending $200 
to $300. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new system using Western Union, ``we can avoid  
speculators from taking advantage of people who are sending 
money,'' said Ninoska Perez Castellon, a spokesman for the Cuban 
American National Foundation, an exile lobbying organization,

	AUSTIN (AP) -- Bass fishing and longhorns may replace the  
bluefish and speedboats of his father's administration if Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush wins the presidency in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is considering buying a ranch of several hundred acres just  
west of Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	His spokesman, Scott McClellan, confirmed Tuesday that the Texas  
governor with White House ambitions is ``interested'' in the area, 
although he said nothing has been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. David Sibley, a Waco Republican, said the deal is  
contingent upon Bush's hobby -- fishing. Bush was awaiting an 
engineer's report on whether the land will hold water, Sibley told 
the Waco Tribune-Herald. That would tell him whether he could build 
a stocked fishing pond on the property. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibley refused to comment further Tuesday on the status of the  
ranch purchase or the asking price. But Martha McCoy, a real estate 
agent who works in nearby Gatesville, estimated the land probably 
would run between $800 and $850 an acre.

	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama is taking steps to make itself a  
bigger player in selecting the Republican Party's presidential 
nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican organizers have 67 meeting places reserved Saturday --  
one in each county -- to start taking applications from prospective 
delegates to the party's first presidential straw poll, Aug. 28 in 
Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	The straw poll, set three weeks after the party's  
election-season opener in Iowa, is the ``South's first stop on the 
road to the White House,'' said Alabama GOP Chairman Winton Blount. 
</P>
<P>
	At the straw poll, delegates will hear from presidential  
candidates and cast votes. 
</P>
<P>
	At the county conventions Saturday, each applicant will have to  
provide proof of being a registered voter in Alabama, show a photo 
ID and pay a $15 registration fee, said Chris Neeley, the party's 
state director. No previous allegiance to the GOP is required, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you wake up in the morning and say, `I am a Republican,'  
then you can come down and register as a delegate and take part,'' 
Neeley said. 
</P>
<P>
	In each county, random drawings will be used to pick delegates  
to the straw poll, where another registration fee -- up to $35 -- 
will be charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates will not be asked in advance of the straw poll to  
pledge support to any presidential candidate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,700 delegates, including GOP officials and large  
contingents selected by the candidates, are expected to attend the 
straw poll.

<HEADLINE> Roseanne Wants To Study in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Comedian and talk show host Roseanne compared  
the Bible to a sitcom Tuesday and then cried as Jerusalem's mayor 
showed her historic sites of the holy land from the roof of city 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Roseanne and Mayor Ehud Olmert held each other close as he  
pointed out the Herodian citadel, the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church 
of the Holy Sepulcher. ``It's amazing! It's amazing,'' she said, 
``this small piece of earth that's holy to three nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The entertainer is in Israel to inaugurate the Jerusalem branch  
of a Jewish mysticism school where she studies in Los Angeles. She 
told reporters she will return to Jerusalem ``when I can stay 
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when that would be, she replied ``well I gotta go home and  
pack.'' She said she wants to study Jewish mysticism, known as 
Kabbalah, in Jerusalem and has brought all her books with her. 
</P>
<P>
	She gave reporters a glimpse of her highly personal brand of  
Judaism. ``The Bible is very funny ... it's like one great 
sitcom,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes after her emotional reaction to looking at the city,  
Roseanne recovered her composure and her quick wit. When a reporter 
asked why she had wept, she quipped that the mayor ``was pinching 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turning serious, however, Roseanne said she cried ``Because I'm  
Jewish ... because for 46 years I've said `Next year in 
Jerusalem.'''

<HEADLINE> Paraguayan Bank Stops Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Paraguayan President Luis Gonzalez  
Macchi said Tuesday that the Central Bank has ceased intervening in 
its foreign exchange market while the currency slides under intense 
market pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez Macchi said the Central Bank intends to allow the  
currency, the guarani, to weaken to its natural level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week the Central Bank intervened in the foreign exchange  
market to brake the dollar's rise, but yesterday it decided to 
withdraw because the dollar will stabilize when it reaches the 
right balance,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez Macchi forecast that level would be 3,250 guaranis to  
the dollar, but the currency plunged to 3,600 in trading Tuesday. 
The currency opened around 3,160 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank devalued the currency by 2.5 percent last  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear, however, whether the non-intervention would  
remain as Paraguay's permanent foreign exchange policy -- amounting 
to a free-float. 
</P>
<P>
	Paraguay has suffered both politically and economically this  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez Macchi became president in late March, after his  
predecessor, Raul Cubas, was forced to resign following the 
assassination of the vice president. And Paraguay is heavily 
dependent on trade with Brazil, which allowed its currency to float 
freely against the dollar in mid-January, leading to a 30 percent 
devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paraguayan currency lost around 8 percent of its value in  
the first six months of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Drug Cos. Fight Bill for Seniors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Drug companies are spreading disinformation  
about legislation that could cut prescription drug prices by up to 
40 percent for senior citizens, the bill's sponsor says. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, introduced by Rep. Thomas Allen, D-Maine, would  
require drug companies to sell drugs to pharmacies that serve 
Medicare beneficiaries at prices currently available to health 
maintenance organizations, large insurance companies, certain 
government agencies and other preferred customers who buy in bulk. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical companies have complained that giving senior  
citizens a discount rate would force them to reduce their research 
and development investments. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bill's supporters say competition would force the  
companies to invest in research regardless. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would reduce ``the cost of prescription drugs for  
Medicare beneficiaries at virtually no cost to the federal 
government. But it might suppress enormous industry profits,'' 
Allen said. ``Therefore, the pharmaceutical industry has embarked 
on a campaign of disinformation fueled by the enormous profits they 
make at the expense of America's seniors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Older Americans who lack prescription drug insurance coverage  
often pay two or three times as much for common medicines than do 
people who have such coverage, said supporters of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if we don't do something about this price  
discrimination soon, we, as members of Congress, should be 
condemned,'' said Rep. Karen Thurman, D-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	But a trade group said the bill could harm new biotechnology  
companies, which are working on new medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are unalterably opposed to the Allen bill's price-control  
approach,'' said Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology 
Industry Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was completely overlooked was the fact that these  
entrepreneurial companies, which are not making any profits, are 
developing the next generation of medicines for the very same 
seniors that this bill purports to protect,'' Feldbaum said. '' ... 
This will keep them from raising the private-sector funds they need 
to continue their biomedical research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Tim Johnson, D-S.D., have  
introduced a companion bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton plans to announce the details of his own  
proposal for reducing prescription drug costs for senior citizens 
later this month. Senior citizens would get Medicare prescription 
drug benefits for the first time under that plan, but they would 
have to pay a monthly premium to help cover the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, a proposal agreed to by 10 of 17 members of the  
National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare earlier 
this year would provide government-subsidized drug benefits only 
for those living near the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the Allen bill, however, have said they support  
changing the Medicare program, but they don't think Congress would 
soon pass a more expensive plan to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 664.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Sheriff Won't Drop Chain Gang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARTMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- The showdown over chain gangs in  
Massachusetts intensified as two more towns joined a growing list 
of communities to reject them. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite votes Monday by selectmen in Dartmouth and Freetown to  
ban community cleanup work by shackled inmates, Bristol County 
Sheriff Thomas Hodgson promised Tuesday to press on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to do our work, and we're going to keep doing  
it,'' he said. ``This is the right thing for the taxpayer, and 
frankly, I'm not going to apologize for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chain gangs, which Hodgson calls tandem work crews, began  
work Thursday in New Bedford. Two groups of five men, chained 
together at the ankle and under guard, painted a fence at a drug 
treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
	Participation in what is believed to be the first chain gang  
program in Massachusetts is strictly voluntary. Inmates with little 
time left to serve are allowed to work in the community without 
chains. The chain gang is for inmates who would normally not be 
eligible for outside work because of the length of their remaining 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some chain gang members said they enjoyed the chance to  
work outdoors, the crews have proved unpopular among some elected 
officials and advocacy groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty International contends chain gangs are degrading ``and  
directly violate international human rights agreements the U.S. 
helped to develop,'' said Joshua Rubenstein, northeast regional 
director for Amnesty International USA.

<HEADLINE> Judge Bars Any Link To Slasher Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Attorneys for two teen-agers accused of  
murdering one youth's mother will not be allowed to introduce 
evidence linking the killing to the slasher movie ``Scream,'' a 
judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge John J. Cheroske gave no explanation for  
the ruling in his court order released Monday. Prosecutors and 
defense lawyers were forbidden from discussing the case with the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court orders that any and all 'Scream' evidence is  
excluded from this trial,'' the judge's order said. ``The court 
orders that this case is not to be referred to as the 'Scream' 
murder case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge on Monday also summoned a panel of prospective jurors  
and began the process of choosing two separate juries for the 
defendants, cousins Mario Salvador Padilla, 17, and Samuel Jeremias 
Ramirez, 16. 
</P>
<P>
	They are being tried as adults in the slaying of Padilla's  
mother, Gina Castillo, 37, who managed to call 911 after she was 
stabbed. The judge said the transcript of the woman's dying words, 
allegedly declaring that her son, Mario, had killed her, would be 
admitted as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	After the January 1998 killing, the boys allegedly confessed and  
said their actions were inspired by the horror movies ``Scream'' 
and Scream II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They admitted to homicide investigators that they killed the  
mother after getting the idea from the movies,'' said Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Sgt. Robert Stoneman said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The case had been seen as an important factor in the current  
national dialogue regarding teen violence and the influence of 
violent movies on youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge sought to limit access by barring TV cameras from  
the trial and clamping a gag order on all participants, instructing 
them not to talk to reporters. He also ordered that transcripts of 
all proceedings, including the preliminary hearing in the case, be 
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Padilla pleaded no contest to a charge of making  
terrorist threats against a classmate, but he was not sentenced 
pending resolution of the slaying case. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge agreed to dismiss so-called special circumstance  
allegations against Ramirez, which means the younger defendant is 
not eligible for the death penalty. No explanation was given. 
</P>
<P>
	Padilla could be sentenced to death if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Stars Celebrate Stanley Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The 50th straight full house at Reunion Arena was  
the most satisfying for Dallas Stars fans, even though a puck was 
never dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	A standing-room-only crowd enjoyed an hour-long celebration  
Monday in honor of the Stanley Cup champions. It was the first 
chance for most fans to see the team and the trophy since the title 
was won early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what happens when you get everyone pulling the rope in  
the same direction,'' general manager Bob Gainey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, who moved to Dallas six years ago after 26 seasons in  
Minnesota, are the southernmost champions the NHL ever had. 
Monday's parade and pep rally definitely had a Texas flair. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Tom Hicks proudly tugged his pant legs to reveal  
black boots with shiny Stanley Cups emblazoned on each shin and the 
team's logo on the back of each calf. Forward Dave Reid wore a 
black cowboy hat throughout the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars won their first title early Sunday with a 2-1  
triple-overtime victory over the Buffalo Sabres. The clinching game 
was on the road and it ended around 12:30 a.m., after many fans 
were asleep and too late to make some editions of the local 
newspapers. Only about 200 fans made it to the airport to greet the 
plane at 6:45 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 75,000 people lined the route for the 45-minute parade  
from City Hall to Reunion Arena. Another 20,000 packed the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The players walked onto a stage one by one, passing through a  
giant star-shaped structure. The last one out was team captain 
Derian Hatcher, who ushered in the Cup beneath a shower of 
fireworks and a burning, revolving star. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher placed the trophy on a 5-foot pedestal in the center of  
the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have it here and it looks good here,'' he said.  
``Hopefully, we can build a nice little house for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each player got a turn hoisting the Cup, and most of them kissed  
the trophy, Mike Modano doing so several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalie Ed Belfour, serenaded by cheers of ``Ed-die! Ed-die!''  
throughout the hour-long show, savored the Cup the longest. He 
circled the stage while Hicks, team president Jim Lites and Gainey 
led a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans goaded Belfour into speaking and, with a voice hoarse from  
36 hours of celebrating, he thanked the crowd for its support. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an unbelievable year,'' said Belfour, who  
inspired one fan to write ``In Eddie We Trust'' on the back of a 
car. ``This is a great moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Ron Kirk read a letter from Gov. George W. Bush, then  
Lites and Hicks addressed the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never, ever for a minute regretted coming here,'' said  
Lites, who joined the organization following the move from 
Minneapolis. ``It's been a great, great, great experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the parade participants were the Reunion Arena Zamboni and  
the heavy metal band Pantera. 
</P>
<P>
	Band members are fans of the team and friends with several  
players. During the parade, the group played their song featuring 
only the words ``Dallas! Stars!'' that is cranked up at Reunion 
during games. 
</P>
<P>
	A much different sort of singer performed at the pep rally.  
</P>
<P>
	B.J. Thomas, best known for ``Raindrops Keep Falling On My  
Head,'' sang the national anthem for the seventh time this season. 
The Stars were 6-0 when he sang, including a victory in Game 5 of 
the finals.

<HEADLINE> Judge Challenges Microsoft Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Microsoft Corp. is wrestling with  
indications from the judge at its trial that he may consider the 
company's intentions toward industry rivals when he decides whether 
it broke antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusually frank exchange with the company's final witness  
Monday, the judge challenged him directly over whether such 
consideration is appropriate as he delivers his verdict later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The move could bode poorly for Microsoft, whose incendiary  
e-mails among top executives describing plans to topple competitors 
have become important evidence in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Richard Schmalensee, who will finish testifying later  
this week, argued that Microsoft's decision to give away its 
Internet software can't be considered ``predatory,'' partly because 
there is no evidence that it planned eventually to begin charging 
for the software. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges in its antitrust case that Microsoft gave  
its software away to undermine sales of a popular rival Web browser 
from Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schmalensee said that without any evidence showing  
Microsoft's pricing strategy was illegal, the judge shouldn't try 
to interpret the company's intentions. That, he said, would be 
``slippery, difficult and fraught with peril.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to know what the intent is of a multiperson  
organization,'' Schmalensee said. ``Most economists would not 
attach high importance to intent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what courts do every day,'' U.S. District Judge Thomas  
Penfield Jackson said, interrupting. Without another way to know 
whether Microsoft set its software prices illegally low, ``I can 
see for the court's purposes why intent might be relevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee testified that even at companies competing fairly,  
``Somebody will write a document that says, 'Let's kill them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's any simpler for the court or for a jury,''  
the judge said. But ``juries are called to do this all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer John Warden said outside court that focusing on  
the rallying cries of employees at the height of the infamous 
``browser wars'' carries ``tremendous risks'' and violates 
principles surrounding antitrust verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very, very difficult to distinguish between the intent  
to get all the business and the intent to drive all the rivals 
out,'' Warden said. ``The same words can mean both those things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, Schmalensee sought to convince the judge that  
federal intervention isn't needed to preserve competition in the 
industry's fight over Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way to see if a war is over is to see whether the sides  
are still firing, and both sides are still firing,'' said 
Schmalensee, citing Netscape's recent purchase for $10 billion by 
America Online Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee maintained that the government, in more than five  
months in the courtroom, has failed to prove that Microsoft's 
behavior toward software rivals hurt consumers -- the guiding 
principle toward applying antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
	The government was expected to begin questioning Schmalensee on  
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> General Dynamics To Buy GTE Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- General Dynamics is buying three  
government systems businesses from the telecommunications company 
GTE Corp. for $1.05 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction, announced Tuesday, has been approved by  
directors of both companies and is expected to close within 60 
days. It is subject to regulatory approval, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the purchase are GTE's Communication Systems  
Division in Taunton, Mass.; Worldwide Telecommunications Services 
in Needham Heights, Mass.; and Electronic Systems Division in 
Mountain View, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The three units have about 6,200 employees are expected to have  
about $1.2 billion in 1999 revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a solid addition to our defense core and a superb  
strategic fit,'' said Nicholas D. Chabraja, chairman and chief 
executive officer of Falls Church, Va.-based General Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the acquisition will more than double the size of the  
defense contractor's information systems and technology unit, which 
had projected 1999 revenues of $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles R. Lee, chairman and CEO of Irving, Tex.-based GTE, said  
the sale will allow GTE to focus on its core telecommunications 
services and reposition for future growth.

<HEADLINE> Marks &AMP; Spencer Chairman Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The chairman of retail chain Marks &AMP; Spencer  
retired today, one month after the company announced a steep plunge 
in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Richard Greenbury had been expected to retire this year, and  
the company had announced it was searching for someone to replace 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that my contribution is complete and that now is the  
right time for me to retire as the business is clearly entering a 
new era,'' said Greenbury, who worked for the chain for 46 years 
and had been chairman for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Baldock, a non-executive director, will serve as chairman  
until a full-time replacement can be found. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretax profits for the year ended March 31 fell 41 percent from  
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the chain announced it was closing its 38 Canadian  
stores this year after mounting losses. It also began laying off 
hundreds of managers.

<HEADLINE> Regulators To OK Supermarket Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Antitrust regulators plan to approve a  
proposed merger of supermarket chain Albertson's Inc. and 
competitor American Stores Co., but have ordered Albertson's to 
sell off about 140 of its stores, according to a source familiar 
with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission has been reviewing the $12 billion  
deal, which was announced in August, but would not comment Monday 
on the status of the investigation. Company officials could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The divestitures would settle antitrust concerns about  
overlapping stores, particularly in California, Nevada and New 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Albertson's, of Boise, Idaho, operates in the Midwest, West and  
Southern states. The Salt Lake City-based American Stores is spread 
across the country from Boston to California but most of its stores 
are in California and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of both grocery stores gave their blessing in  
November to the merger, which would give the companies annual 
revenues topping $36 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would create the nation's second largest supermarket  
chain behind the Cincinnati-based Kroger, which last month 
completed its acquisition of Fred Meyer Inc., bringing its combined 
sales to $43.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of divestitures is larger than analysts had predicted  
and brings Albertson's close to its ``walk away provision,'' said 
Mike Shea, an analyst with D.A. Davidson &AMP; Co. in Portland, Ore. 
The supermarket chain had said if more than a certain percent of 
their stores had to be divested, it would abandon the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's larger than expected, no question,'' Shea said. Analysts  
had initially anticipated between 50 and 100 divestitures. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though Albertson's will have to sell a chunk of their  
California stores, the state remains a strong market for the 
company, he said. And the companies have also said they expect to 
save $300 million by combining their operation within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a great deal long-term of Albertson's,'' Shea  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea added that he thinks it's unlikely that the sizable  
divestiture requirements ordered by the commission will put a halt 
to the current merger fever in the grocery and drugstore arena.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Loses in Big Wimbledon Upset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Martina Hingis couldn't cry on her  
mother's shoulder this time. 
</P>
<P>
	She told her mother to stay away from Wimbledon, give her more  
space, let her practice, play and grow up more on her own. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after suffering the greatest upset in women's tennis  
history, two weeks after her tearful exit in her mother's arms at 
the French Open final, Hingis felt terribly alone as she moped away 
in stunned silence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I need to take some time off,'' the 18-year-old Hingis  
said, her career suddenly in disarray after a 6-2, 6-0 thrashing 
Tuesday by 16-year-old Australian Jelena Dokic. 
</P>
<P>
	No top-seeded woman had ever lost in the first round of a Grand  
Slam tournament to a player ranked as low as the No. 129 Dokic, who 
had to win three qualifying matches to reach the main draw of her 
third major. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other top-seeded women in the open era -- Steffi Graf at  
Wimbledon in 1994 and Virginia Ruzici at the Australian in 1979 -- 
lost in the first round and neither of their opponents was ranked 
as low as Dokic. 
</P>
<P>
	Dokic turned to her father, Damir, after the match and found him  
``out of words,'' which is just the way tennis officials would like 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, he was ejected from a tuneup tournament for  
shouting abuse at officials during his daughter's match. He was 
later arrested for lying down in traffic and jumping on the hood of 
a car. Police said he had been drinking and was arrested ``for his 
own safety.'' He was not charged, and was released after three 
hours ``when he sobered up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet as he watched his daughter beat Hingis, the 1997 Wimbledon  
champ and winner of five Grand Slam titles, Dokic was a model of 
decorum. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still hard to believe that I've beaten Martina,'' Jelena  
said. ``But I have to keep my feet on the ground because anything 
can happen in the next match. Just because I've beaten Martina 
doesn't mean I'll win the tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That match was the biggest surprise in a day of surprises.  
</P>
<P>
	There was Boris Becker, raising his arms in weary triumph after  
four hours, the victor in one of the great comebacks in men's 
tennis history. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker didn't just fight back from two sets down -- he'd done  
that nine times before -- and three match points in the fourth set. 
He came back from two years away from Grand Slam tennis, beginning 
perhaps his last Wimbledon with a 5-7, 6-7 (7-9), 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 
victory over British wild card Miles Maclagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker's biggest worry in the match wasn't actually losing. It  
was the chance that his pregnant wife, Barbara, might go into labor 
watching him. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was getting very excited toward the end of the fourth set,  
and I turned to her and told her to be quiet, to calm down a little 
because otherwise we have a baby on the court,'' Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their second child is due in mid-August, Becker said, ``but  
another five-setter and I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only surprise Andre Agassi came up with was a new  
clean-shaven look as he came back two weeks after winning the 
French Open to beat Andrei Pavel 6-1, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a mild surprise in seeing Jennifer Capriati continue  
her own comeback by completing a 5-7, 6-3, 9-7 victory over Anke 
Huber in a match that had been suspended at 5-5 in the third set 
the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was a surprise in seeing Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario,  
twice a Wimbledon finalist, struggle so much before beating 
qualifier Anna-Maria Foldenyi 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing quite dazzled the crowd like Dokic's rout of Hingis.  
</P>
<P>
	Dokic, 5-foot-6 and quick as a sprinter, kept Hingis deep and  
drove her wide with angled, two-fisted backhands and huge 
forehands. Deft drop shots made Hingis pay for staying back. During 
a stretch of 11 straight games that she won, Dokic bobbed up and 
down at the baseline like a boxer warming up. 
</P>
<P>
	Five months ago in the Australian Open, it was Hingis who did  
the bobbing, beating the then-15-year-old Dokic 6-1, 6-2 in the 
third round. But that was hardly representative of the kind of 
tennis Dokic can play. 
</P>
<P>
	Though unknown to casual fans, Dokic was the 1998 world junior  
champion. She immigrated to Australia in 1994 from her native 
Serbia and turned pro late last year. She is coached by her father 
and, recently, former pro Wally Masur. 
</P>
<P>
	She made a big splash in early January when she beat  
Sanchez-Vicario, ranked No. 4 at the time, and Sandrine Testud, No. 
15, as she combined with Mark Philippoussis to lead Australia to 
its first Hopman Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fed Cup play a few months later, she beat another tough  
player, No. 19 Barbara Schett. 
</P>
<P>
	Dokic's low ranking coming into Wimbledon didn't reflect the  
quality of her game as much as the limited opportunity she had to 
play tournaments. Age restrictions on the WTA Tour allow her to 
play only 10 tournaments and four Grand Slam events this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory over Hingis should put Dokic in the top 50, and she  
seems headed for the top 10 within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``She played a great match today,'' said Hingis, who recently  
invited Dokic to practice with her in Switzerland. ``She didn't 
really let me get back into it. I had a few chances, of course, but 
I didn't take them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis later pulled out of the doubles competition, citing an  
unspecified medical problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``What went wrong?'' Hingis was asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am not sure what went right, actually,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	She needs time off ``from everything,'' she said, and won't play  
tennis for at least another month. Whether her mother, Melanie 
Molitor, is at courtside when she returns is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just decided to have a little bit of distance and work more  
on our private lives,'' Hingis said. 
</P>
<P>
	This tournament was the first time mother and daughter have been  
apart at a Grand Slam event. Asked if that made a difference, 
Hingis responded: 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess so. A pretty big one.''

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Ban on Burma Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a lower  
court decision to strike down a Massachusetts law that bars the 
state from doing business with companies that trade with Myanmar, 
formerly known as Burma. 
</P>
<P>
	In a decision that could affect dozens of states and local  
governments with economic boycotts protesting perceived social or 
political injustices in foreign lands, a three-judge panel of the 
1st Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Massachusetts law 
``interferes with the foreign affairs power of the federal 
government and is thus unconstitutional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts enacted its law in 1996 because of human rights  
violations by Burma's military dictators. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's decision could affect 20-plus states and local  
governments -- including New York City, San Francisco and Portland, 
Ore. -- that have Burma boycott laws. It could also endanger laws 
barring the buying of goods from sweatshops or bans on investments 
in Northern Ireland-based companies that engage in religious 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court ruling reaffirmed a November decision by U.S.  
District Court Judge Joseph Tauro declaring that the Massachusetts 
Burma Law ``impermissibly infringes on the federal government's 
power to regulate foreign affairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was brought by the National Foreign Trade Council,  
which represents major U.S. corporations that it won't name for 
fear consumers will boycott them. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFTC had argued that local and state governments have no  
right to interfere in foreign policy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The state had argued that it is Congress who must decide whether  
a state or local government may enact legislation that affects 
foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress, the state argued, enacted federal sanctions against  
Myanmar several months after Massachusetts enacted its law -- and 
chose not to override the state law. Furthermore, the state isn't 
regulating conduct, it is merely choosing how to spend taxpayers' 
money, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	NFTC President Frank Kittredge applauded Tuesday's decision,  
calling it a ``full and sweeping'' rejection of Massachusetts' 
right to impose its own economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Massachusetts has no authority in setting foreign policy or  
being involved in foreign commerce,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said while the Massachusetts law had limited impact, that ban  
combined with other state and local sanctions made the U.S. appear 
as an unreliable trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the state said they were disappointed by the  
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish it had come out the other way, we're reviewing the  
decision and considering options,'' said Assistant Attorney General 
Thomas A. Barnico. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has 90 days to decide whether to appeal to the U.S.  
Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chicago Cop Sentenced to 4 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The last of seven former police officers charged  
with taking payoffs from drug dealers was sentenced Tuesday to 
nearly four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Taran Hunter, who worked for the suburban Ford Heights  
force, pleaded guilty to racketeering. He is to begin his sentence 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers, comprising most of the Ford Heights force, were  
arrested in 1996 on charges of taking cash in exchange for ignoring 
drug dealing. The six other defendants have been sentenced, most to 
longer prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter acknowledged that he had taken two payoffs from FBI  
cooperating witnesses who taped the deals. One posed as a drug 
dealer, and Hunter agreed to protect his operations. The other was 
charged with battery, and Hunter promised to arrange for the 
dismissal of the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Hunter said that he took periodic payments from a  
real drug dealer and accepted $3,000 in exchange for allowing an 
inmate to leave his cell temporarily.

<HEADLINE> NHL Irons Out Crease Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NHL has already made its case about puck  
control in the crease. Now officials will look at what control the 
league can have over an arena at the end of a Stanley Cup playoff 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said Tuesday that was a league  
priority, particularly after a celebration scene took place on the 
ice before officials had ruled on the legality of Dallas' 
Cup-winning goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to take a good look at what precisely  
happened for opening the doors,'' Bettman said 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman and several other officials held a conference call with  
the media in an attempt to further clarify the controversy 
involving Brett Hull's goal that gave Dallas a 2-1 triple-overtime 
victory early Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Included were Bettman, director of hockey operations Colin  
Campbell, supervisor of officials Bryan Lewis and Terry Gregson, 
one of the two referees at decisive Game 6 at Buffalo's Marine 
Midland Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	While the officials reiterated why the goal was good, one  
question still hanging concerned the opening of the doors used by 
the Zamboni to get to the ice surface, and a flood of photographers 
on the rink immediately after Hull's goal. 
</P>
<P>
	All this happened while officials were reviewing the goal, which  
was scored by Hull with one of his skates in the crease. At first 
it appeared to violate the NHL's man-in-the-crease rule. The goal 
was eventually allowed because, as officials pointed out, Hull had 
control of the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the quick opening of the doors that allowed people,  
other than players, on the ice, Bettman said the league controlled 
many aspects of a playoff game, but not everything. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we should have our own operator drive the Zamboni and  
maybe we should have our PA announcer. We do change a lot of things 
for the playoffs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of scoring, we bring our own crews and our own  
off-ice officials from other cities at considerable expense. It's 
generally tough to replace building security with your own 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the scene on the ice immediately after the game,  
Campbell said, ``Security controls the doors -- ask Midland 
security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said he was too busy reviewing the goal to notice what was  
happening on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our immediate response was to review the goal,'' Lewis said.  
``I'm just concerned about the legality of the goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In answer to a question, Lewis said the premature celebration  
did not sway the officials' call one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's conference call came one day after the league  
announced it will no longer use videotape replays to decide 
disputed calls when a player is in the crease. Replays will be used 
for all other goal disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman said the action had nothing to do with the recent uproar  
at the finals, but rather with keeping the game more spontaneous. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dallas, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock called it ``a great rule.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We put more responsibility back to the referees, where it  
belongs. Goals will increase. People will get a little more 
determined around the net area. You'll see offense go up quite a 
bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offensive hockey is coming back.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock also liked another new rule: using four skaters  
instead of five in overtime to help break ties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wait until you see 4-on-4. I saw two games on tape of 4-on-4  
overtimes and they are wild, absolutely wild,'' Hitchcock said. 
``Now people will have to stay in the building in overtime and not 
go home. 
</P>
<P>
	``You start overtime trying for the knockout punch. You can't  
play it conservatively because as soon as you back off, the other 
team comes at you with too much speed because there's too much 
room. So you better go and get them before they get you because 
it's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teams will get one point each in the standings for the tie in  
regulation, and the winner in overtime will get one more point.

<HEADLINE> Rats Brain Activity Controls Robot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists have gotten rats to control a simple  
robot arm through the activity of their brain cells. That might be 
a step toward letting paralyzed people control prosthetic limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Six rats learned at first to press a lever to make the arm move  
back and forth like a windshield wiper. Then scientists implanted 
electrodes in the animals' brains, to detect the pattern of brain 
cell activity that made the animals' legs press the lever. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the scientists switched control of the arm to a device  
that monitored the rats' brains and moved the arm when the 
appropriate brain activity appeared. Four animals were able to 
continue controlling the arm in this way. 
</P>
<P>
	The work is reported in the July issue of the journal Nature  
Neuroscience by scientists at the Duke University Medical Center in 
Durham, N.C., and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, scientists have reported that paralyzed people can  
learn to use their brain waves to control the movement of a cursor 
on a computer screen. The brain activity was picked up by 
electrodes that had been implanted or placed on the scalp. 
</P>
<P>
	By moving the cursor, the paralyzed people were able to  
communicate.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Outfielder Armando Rios was placed on the  
15-day disabled list by the San Francisco Giants on Tuesday with a 
partial tear of his left rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios was scheduled for arthroscopic surgery Tuesday, but decided  
to put off the operation until after getting a second opinion from 
orthopedist Jim Andrews in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't know if it's a partial or the whole tear,'' said  
Rios, who will pay his own way to Alabama for the second opinion. 
``I just feel like if someone's going to go in, I don't want just 
one person's opinion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rios, who partially tore his right rotator cuff in 1997, left  
Monday night's game against the Milwaukee Brewers in the eighth 
inning with a jammed shoulder. He was injured an inning earlier

<HEADLINE> Newton, Orlando Feud Hits Sour Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- The feud between singers Wayne Newton  
and Tony Orlando has hit another sour note. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the performers shared what was then the Talk of the  
T.O.W.N. Theatre until Newton, whose company leased the building, 
allegedly locked Orlando out, saying Orlando owed him more than $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Orlando sued Newton in federal court, claiming the  
lockout cost him $125,000 from 11 canceled shows last year, and 
millions more in projected earnings over the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton countersued on Monday, seeking more than $20 million in  
damages. His suit disputes Orlando's account, and accuses him of 
spreading false claims in the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	The countersuit also accuses Orlando of providing false  
information that led to their professional relationship, including 
the average number of tickets he sold during the prior season, and 
claims of how many people he could draw to the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the breakup, the two said they had been friends more than  
30 years.

<HEADLINE> Swiss at Loss After Losing 2006 Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- In a national bout of soul-searching following the  
unexpected loss of the 2006 Winter Olympics, Switzerland has 
concluded that it is isolated and unloved as never before. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend decision by the International Olympic Committee to  
award the 2006 Games to the Italian city of Turin rather than Swiss 
front-runner Sion has unleashed anger and accusations of dirty 
tricks in the scandal-ridden International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is also seen as a political rebuke for the Swiss, whose  
international reputation has been tarnished by allegations of 
wartime collusion with the Nazis. There is a growing realization 
that the small Alpine nation -- which champions its neutrality and 
is a member of neither the United Nations nor European Union -- must 
change its ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never even dreamed that we had such a bad reputation,''  
Sports Minister Adolf Ogi told the Le Temps newspaper in an 
interview published Tuesday. ``We have a strong economic presence 
worldwide, but politically we are alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard delegates say they wanted the Swiss to lose. People  
don't like Switzerland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of neutral Switzerland's World War II role and its  
treatment of Holocaust victims' assets has led to frayed relations 
with the United States and other countries. Jewish groups have 
accused it of profiting from the Holocaust, by retaining the assets 
of Jews slain by the Nazis and acting as Adolf Hitler's banker, 
trafficking in gold stolen by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, after much foot-dragging, Switzerland's two biggest  
banks agreed to pay $1.25 billion in an out-of-court settlement of 
Holocaust survivors' claims for wartime losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Ogi, like most other commentators, said the overwhelming  
53-36 Olympic vote in favor of Turin was principally a backlash 
against Swiss IOC member Marc Hodler. It was Hodler who blew the 
whistle on wrong-doing by Salt Lake City and forced the 
Swiss-headquartered Olympic movement into an anti-corruption drive 
which forced out nine members and cost the rest their privileges. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, a shaken Ogi conceded that Switzerland's image  
problem stemmed from ``our attitude.'' Numerous IOC members and 
other Olympic officials have said the loss was as much because the 
Swiss were perceived as arrogant and overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We claim to be the best. We play at being school masters and  
teaching others lessons. We overestimate ourselves,'' said Ogi, who 
is also Swiss vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite initial concern about costs and the environment,  
Switzerland's Olympic bid was remarkable because of the popular 
enthusiasm and financial sponsorship it gathered in this 
traditionally cautious country. The red-and-white Sion logo was 
emblazoned over trains, buses, bottles of wine, chocolate and even 
toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC evaluation commission earlier this year gave Sion a much  
better rating than Turin or other rivals. After losing out to Salt 
Lake City for the 2002 Games, the Swiss brimmed with confidence and 
planned a huge party in Sion's main square to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	There were hopes the Games would create up to 15,000 new jobs  
and revitalize the tourist industry in the southern Valais Alps. 
The Games were also seen as a vital chance of repairing the public 
relations damage inflicted by the Holocaust controversy. The mass 
influx of visitors was also expected to make the notoriously 
insular Swiss more open to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the nation is geographically in the heart of Europe,  
voters in 1992 rejected government plans to join a lose trade pact, 
putting a formal membership application for the European Union on 
indefinite hold. 
</P>
<P>
	After tortuous negotiations, Swiss ministers signed an agreement  
Monday for freer trade in sectors like agriculture, transport, 
labor and research. But diehard defenders of Swiss neutrality have 
indicated they will try to drum up enough support to hold a 
national referendum to throw out the accords. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we are almost European,'' was the headline comment in the  
mass-selling Blick newspaper Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the paper topped its front page with a survey on ``Why the  
world doesn't love us'' in which its foreign correspondents 
canvassed foreign opinions about the Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
	From Italy came the view that the Swiss are racist; from France  
came the notion that all Swiss were ``stinking rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The British criticized the Swiss for being boring and  
obsessively tidy. Israelis found them anti-Semitic and ``a good 
sleeping pill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans said Switzerland was a ``sterile picture postcard''  
inhabited by colorless people always looking for their own 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pedantic and humorless. We are greedy profiteers. We  
are arrogant. We are bad losers,'' summarized Blick. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how the world sees us.''

<HEADLINE> Truck With 3 Bodies Pulled From Pond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CELEBRATION, Fla. (AP) -- A rental vehicle was pulled from a pond  
with three bodies in it, apparently solving the question of what 
happened to three friends who disappeared while on vacation nine 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Renquin, 35, Dan Nelson, 32, and Roger DesVergnes, 31, all  
of Attleboro, Mass., were last seen leaving their rented 
condominium Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	The GMC sport utility vehicle that they had rented was pulled  
Monday from a retention pond in this upscale community near Walt 
Disney World, not far from the Orlando timeshare they rented. The 
vehicle was lying upside down in 16 feet of water, about 125 feet 
from a road. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the vehicle we were looking for,'' said police Sgt.  
Orlando Rolon, adding the license plate number confirmed the match. 
</P>
<P>
	Foul play was not suspected. ``Unless the medical examiner  
determines otherwise, this will be (ruled) a tragic traffic 
accident,'' Rolon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dental records will be checked to make a positive  
identification, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's families became concerned when they did not return  
home from their weeklong vacation as scheduled Oct. 2. Police 
searched their rental unit and found cash, unpacked suitcases and a 
refrigerator stocked with food. Relatives said they never would 
never have willingly abandoned their homes or jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are partially relieved, but mostly sad,'' Julie Renquin,  
Renquin's sister-in-law, said after hearing the news Monday. ``Now 
we are finally starting to mourn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad for the families that this has finally come to an  
end,'' said police Detective Barbara Bergin. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have pulled nearly a half-dozen vehicles from the  
pond in recent months. Some had been stolen, while others ended up 
in the water by accident.

<HEADLINE> Indian Railway Bomb Kills 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CALCUTTA, India (AP) -- A bomb exploded today at a railway  
station in northeastern India, killing 10 people and injuring 80 in 
an attack that police blamed on Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast just after noon at New Jalpaiguri, 270 miles north of  
Calcutta, was heard a half mile away and ripped off the railroad 
station's iron roof, said Ramkrishna Roy, a police inspector. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no claim of responsibility for the bombing. But Roy  
said Pakistan's intelligence agency was believed to have been 
involved in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Minister Jyoti Basu, the West Bengal state's top elected  
official, met with other officials today to review security. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Inspector Prasun Mukherjee confirmed that two of the 10  
dead were army privates, among a group on their way to fight at the 
Kashmir front where India is battling Muslim intruders who seized 
Himalayan mountain peak strongholds in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb exploded between two platforms just as a regional train  
pulled into the station, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 42 of the injured were hospitalized in critical  
condition, Press Trust of India quoted railway physician Dr. A.K. 
Das as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	United News of India said 16 soldiers were seriously injured.  
</P>
<P>
	The explosion damaged two cars of a train that was to have  
headed southeast to Cooch Behar in West Bengal, said Roy. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Pakistan, other enemies of the Indian government  
include tribal and ethnic groups in eastern India fighting 
guerrilla campaigns for greater autonomy or independence.

<HEADLINE> BASF To Close Plant Outside Albany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENSSELAER, N.Y. (AP) -- German chemical group BASF AG will close  
its 200-employee manufacturing plant outside Albany by late 2000, 
officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company blamed foreign competition in dye manufacturing for  
the closure of the 125-year factory in Rensselaer. 
</P>
<P>
	BASF decided that to remain competitive and improve long-term  
viability in the market, the corporation must streamline its 
manufacturing, said Michael Stumpp, group vice president of BASF 
Corp.'s Colorants and Textile/Leather Chemicals business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rensselaer plant, built in the decade after the Civil War,  
also allowed few inexpensive upgrades, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it would help employees losing their job to  
find other positions, possibly in BASF. The company employs 15,000 
workers in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	BASF is one of Germany's three largest chemical groups. It makes  
chemicals, plastics, dyes and paints, pharmaceuticals, nylon fibers 
and agriculture products.

<HEADLINE> NHL Changes Video Replay Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just as the NFL is bringing in instant replay,  
the NHL is cutting back on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no longer zero tolerance, we're going to leave the crease  
to a judgment call,'' NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said Monday in 
announcing the league will no longer use videotape replays to 
decide disputed calls when a player is in the crease. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman said Colin Campbell, the NHL's director of hockey  
operations, will work on a new interpretation of the rule, and he 
is expected to have it in place for on-ice officials before the 
start of the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to go more to an interpretation standard, but we  
are still going to keep the old (man-in-the-crease) rule,'' Bettman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman said the action had nothing to do with the recent uproar  
at the Stanley Cup finals over Brett Hull's questionable goal, but 
rather with keeping the game more spontaneous. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman said it was his opinion that videotape reviews cause  
games to lose their momentum. The video replay situation was 
discussed by the league's general managers about a week before the 
controversial Game 6 in Buffalo's Marine Midland Arena, Bettman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're relying too much on replay'' for goal decisions, Bettman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action, the board approved a new system for overtime.  
The NHL had 161 of its 220 overtime games end in ties this past 
season and would like to see more of them resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1999-2000 season, when teams are tied after regulation,  
they will each receive a point in the standings. Then a five-minute 
overtime period will be held, with each team using four skaters 
instead of five. A winning team would receive another point. 
</P>
<P>
	Videotape replay will remain in use for all other existing  
circumstances, such as if the puck has crossed the goal line, if it 
is in the net prior to the goal frame being dislodged, or if it is 
in the net before time has expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman's announcement came less than two days after a huge  
controversy following Dallas' 2-1 triple-overtime victory over 
Buffalo that gave the Stars the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was decided early Sunday morning when Hull scored from  
in front with one of his skates clearly in the goal crease. The 
rule usually disallows a goal if an offensive player has any part 
of his body in the crease. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres said a replay showed that Hull's goal should have  
been disallowed because his skate preceded the puck into the crease 
before he shot it past Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	The official response from the league after the goal was that it  
didn't matter that Hull had his skate in the crease, but that he 
had full control of the puck. Supervisor of officials Bryan Lewis 
said the play was reviewed on videotape at least six times. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than saying ``the absolute right call'' was made on Hull's  
goal, Bettman would not address the Game 6 controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule was absolutely, correctly applied,'' Bettman said.  
``Everyone understands it was the right call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rule, drawn up to protect goalies from injury, is disliked  
by many skaters. Many goals have been disallowed by infractions 
that are purely incidental to the play, such as a teammate's skate 
in the crease away from the action. 
</P>
<P>
	The new overtime format was used by the American Hockey League  
this season on an experimental basis, and the league was satisfied 
with the results: Of the 44 games that went into overtime, 27 had 
the ties broken. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also approved an increase in the number of games  
officiated under the two-referee system to 700 from last season's 
270, 
</P>
<P>
	The governors also approved the expected transfer of ownership  
of the Washington Capitals to a group composed of Ted Leonsis, Jon 
Ledecky and Richard Patrick from Abe Pollin.

<P>
	TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Juan del Regato, a physician  
regarded as a pioneer in the use of radiation therapy to treat 
cancer, died June 12. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1949, del Regato helped start the first training center in  
the United States dedicated to therapeutic radiation therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is credited with coordinating the first clinical trials  
evaluating the success of radiation used to treat inoperable 
prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Regato founded the American Club of Therapeutic  
Radiologists, now called the American Society for Therapeutic 
Radiology and Oncology.

</P>
<P>
	DALHART, Texas (AP) -- J. Kenneth Hogue, a former Oklahoma  
lawmaker, World War II veteran and longtime publisher of the 
Dalhart Daily Texan, died Sunday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogue bought the newspaper in partnership with his brother,  
Harold, and took possession of the business on Jan. 1, 1947. For 
the next four decades, he chronicled events through his column, 
``My Akin' Back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hogue served as a director and president of the Panhandle Press  
Association, eventually being inducted into the group's hall of 
fame. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1937, he was elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives  
at the age of 25. He ascended to the office of speaker pro tem at 
the Legislature's next meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	After two terms in the House, Hogue ran for the state Senate and  
lost by 176 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	He volunteered for active Army duty in 1940 and served in World  
War II as an artillery lieutenant. He left the Army in 1946 as a 
lieutenant colonel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogue continued as publisher of the Texan until June 1, 1989,  
when his daughter Susan and son-in-law bought the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, two daughters, a son, two sisters,  
12 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

	``Four Reissues'' (Epic-Legacy) -- Stevie Ray Vaughan &AMP; Double  
Trouble 

</P>
<P>
	So you never purchased CDs of the Double Trouble band's four  
studio albums -- ``Texas Flood,'' ``Couldn't Stand the Weather,'' 
``Soul to Soul'' and ``In Step.'' Perhaps you love the old vinyl 
too much or you hoped for cleaner recordings or you have been 
chronically broke. Now your wait must end. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, you could hold out longer until Epic releases the SRV  
boxed set promised this year, but who knows what they are going to 
leave out? It is always better to have the album arrangements the 
performers sequenced for themselves, especially for someone like 
Stevie Ray, who never recorded a lame track. 
</P>
<P>
	To make these CD reissues irresistible, Epic added 14 new  
tracks, half of them live, totaling 77 minutes across the four 
discs. It's like creating a fifth album. 
</P>
<P>
	The added studio tracks were recorded in the same sessions with  
the original albums but never included. As for the bonus tracks 
that were recorded live, similar versions appear on SRV's live 
releases, but these bonus versions are fresh enough to be worth 
having. 
</P>
<P>
	And what bonuses! From the seductive ``Tin Pan Alley'' on the  
``Texas Flood'' reissue to the long-overdue appearance of a Hound 
Dog Taylor cover, ``Give Me Back My Wig,'' on ``Weather,'' they are 
all terrific. 
</P>
<P>
	Each disc contains brief interviews with Stevie that are  
distracting but at least demarcate where the bonus tracks begin. 
</P>
<P>
	No more excuses not to own all four discs because these were,  
and are, the best blues releases of the past two decades.

	``What It Is'' (Blue Note) -- Jacky Terrasson  

</P>
<P>
	Jazz pianist Jacky Terrasson is in search of the perfect groove  
on ``What It Is,'' a glorious mix of eclectic, rhythm-driven music 
heavy on percussion, syncopation and humor. 
</P>
<P>
	For his fourth album as a leader, Terrasson assembled his  
largest band yet, including saxophone, flute, harmonica and Cuban 
vocalist Xiomara Laugart on the Latin-flavored ``Better World.'' 
Other highlights include Ravel's ``Bolero'' in 7/8 time, Pink Floyd's 
``Money'' complete with jingling coins and the War-like funk of 
``Toot-Toot's Tune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not all. The rollicking ``Le Roi Basil'' is worthy of  
Return to Forever's best work. And on the hard-driving ``What's 
Wrong With You!'', Terrasson and saxophonist Michael Brecker trade 
frenetic solos, settling on the same chord for 16 bars at a time. 
As they savor the liberating beat, we can, too.

	``Wagner Takes the A Train'' (Elysium Recordings) -- Valerie  
Capers 

</P>
<P>
	So what would happen if Duke Ellington met Wagner? Or Beethoven?  
Or Mozart? After all, Ellington is considered one of America's 
premier composers, even if he worked in a slightly different genre 
than the three classical composers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wagner Takes the A Train,'' a tribute to both Ellington and  
Wagner that is well-conceived and well-played by pianist Valerie 
Capers, tries to answer that question. 
</P>
<P>
	Capers, a graduate of both The Juilliard School of Music and the  
New York Institute for the Education of the Blind, inserts a little 
more Ellington than Wagner on the title cut. 
</P>
<P>
	And the record as a whole, which includes versions of the  
Ellington standard ``Mood Indigo'' and Gershwin's ``They Can't Take 
That Away From Me,'' is pure jazz. But on her arrangement of 
Wagner's ``Winter's Love,'' which includes a flute, Capers shows 
how well classical and jazz work together -- something jazz 
musicians like Ellington, Ron Carter, Wynton Marsalis, the Modern 
Jazz Quartet and others have long demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Capers' sublime playing is highlighted on the dark and  
multilayered ``My One and Only Love.''

	``Cajunization'' (Rhino Records) -- Beausoleil with Michael  
Doucet 

</P>
<P>
	Could it be that the best known Cajun band is losing touch with  
what made the music so popular to begin with? 
</P>
<P>
	Make no mistake, Beausoleil's latest, ``Cajunization,'' is  
heartfelt -- to a fault. It lacks the danceability that makes Cajun 
music so infectious. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it offers brooding midtempo numbers such as  
``Cajunization Blues'' and ``La Terre de mon Grandpere'' (``My 
Grandfather's Land''). And although the liner notes translate the 
sometimes passionate lyrics from French (as has been the case on 
most of Beausoleil's other albums), the songs lose something in the 
delivery for those who don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Only on the blues-influenced ``Zarico Boogie'' does any sense of  
fun emerge, and that is joined by ``Jusqu'a la Nuit'' (``Until the 
Night'') as the only two cuts that evoke the feeling of a crowded 
club steaming from all the dancing.

<HEADLINE> Mets Send Isringhausen to Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jason Isringhausen, once one of the New York  
Mets' most promising pitching prospects, was sent back to the 
minors after Tuesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen, who went 1-2 with a 7.30 ERA in five starts since  
his recall last month, will pitch out of the bullpen in Triple-A 
Norfolk. Right-hander Octavio Dotel will take Isringhausen's place 
and start Saturday at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to crawl before I walk,'' an upbeat Isringhausen said.  
``I've never relieved before. They think I have the mentality and 
the stuff to do it. I'm looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen, who has gone through two operations on his right  
elbow and one on his shoulder, frustrated the Mets after saying he 
was ``confused'' on the mound during his last start in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has complained that his arm feels like a ``noodle''  
after 75 pitches, forcing manager Bobby Valentine to go to the 
bullpen earlier than he would like. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to see how he will pitch in this role,'' general  
manager Steve Phillips said. ``We will break him in slowly. We will 
start off by letting him know what inning and what day he will 
pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets hope maybe the reduced strain of pitching out of the  
pen will help Isringhausen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will take long for me to adapt to the 'pen,''  
he said. ``I will just have to make a few mental adjustments. Maybe 
I'm better off pitching an inning or two a day instead of once 
every five.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen, 26, was considered a top pitching prospect for the  
team and went 9-2 with a 2.81 ERA as a rookie in 1995. Along with 
Paul Wilson and Bill Pulsipher, Isringhausen was supposed to anchor 
the Mets pitching staff for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, all three have been beset by injury and  
ineffectiveness. Wilson underwent reconstructive surgery on his 
right elbow in March and Pulsipher was traded to Milwaukee last 
season after reconstructive surgery of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen has had his once-promising career slowed by a  
succession of injuries including a broken wrist in 1997, 
arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder and elbow in 1996, and 
reconstructive surgery on his right elbow last season. He also 
battled through a 1997 bout with tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Dotel was 5-2 with a 3.99 ERA in 12 starts at Norfolk. He struck  
out 84 batters in 65 1-3 innings, including 17 in a one-hitter last 
month against Toledo.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Lawyers Seek Mistrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An attorney called cigarette makers deceitful and  
callous in his closing arguments in a landmark $200 billion lawsuit 
by smokers, leading tobacco company lawyers to demand a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Rosenblatt represents up to half a million sick  
plaintiffs and their heirs in the first class-action lawsuit by 
smokers to reach trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an industry which basically just has no shame,'' he  
said in court Monday. ``The only health the tobacco industry has 
ever been interested in is the health of their bottom line. They 
don't give a damn about the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry lawyers objected, but Rosenblatt shot back: ``They  
don't care a hoot about the health of the American people. They 
care about the health of what goes into their pockets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamine Reid, who represents R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., called  
Rosenblatt's statements ``an attempt to inflame the jurors and have 
them reach a judgment based on passion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had one day of argument, and in that day counsel has  
mentioned the Holocaust, Rosa Parks and civil rights, whites-only 
water fountains in this courthouse, and Martin Luther King on three 
occasions,'' complained Ed Moss, an attorney for Brown &AMP; Williamson 
Tobacco Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the remaining jurors and alternates are black or  
Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry lawyers moved for a mistrial; Circuit Judge Robert  
Kaye deferred ruling on their request. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco company lawyers were scheduled to begin their two  
days of closing arguments on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs say they were misled about just how dangerous  
smoking really is and are seeking $200 billion in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants contend everybody knows smoking is risky, but  
there's no scientific proof the habit causes any illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The other defendants are Philip Morris Inc., Lorillard Tobacco  
Co. and Liggett Group Inc., as well as the Council for Tobacco 
Research and the Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Boston Pops: 30th Season on PBS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Boston Pops starts its 30th season with  
Shakespeare, moves on to swing music and has Nathan Lane singing 
Danny Kaye songs from movies, recordings and Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	Does Lane also tell jokes? ``Can you imagine Nathan Lane  
performing without doing jokes?'' responds Keith Lockhart, 
conductor of the Boston Pops. As to whether they're Danny Kaye or 
Nathan Lane jokes, Lockhart says, ``It's hard to tell. The line has 
been blurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Pops first appeared on national television July 5,  
1970, with jazz pianist George Shearing as guest. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as produced for PBS by WGBH in Boston and the Boston  
Symphony, this season's opener will be ``Brush Up Your 
Shakespeare,'' airing 8 p.m. EDT Thursday, June 24. ``Swingin' at 
the Pops'' will be seen July 8 and Lane's appearance will be July 
15. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-show season also includes Broadway singer Audra McDonald  
July 22 and movie music July 29, plus five repeat concerts from 
1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart says the series is meant to be entertaining and  
engaging and to do some shows, like ``Brush Up Your Shakespeare,'' 
that make people say, ``I never thought I'd see that on 'Evening at 
Pops.''' The show contains music inspired by Shakespeare -- the 
title song is by Cole Porter -- and scenes by Shakespeare and 
Company of Lenox, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd been lobbying for this program since I got here,''  
Lockhart says, ``We finally managed it in a season where it seems 
Shakespeare is hot again. I'm a lifelong lover of about every word 
the man put on a page. He was not writing to a highbrow audience. 
It's bawdy -- it was the R-rated movies of its day -- and it has some 
of the most sublime thoughts ever penned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Music ranges from Verdi's ``Otello'' to Porter's ``Kiss Me  
Kate,'' from Tchaikovsky's ``Romeo and Juliet'' to Bernstein's 
``West Side Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart, 39, recalls watching ``Evening at Pops'' as a child in  
Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``My memory is of this elfish, grandfatherly guy 
with a white mustache. Arthur Fiedler really owned those programs. 
I still remember him looking just like what I thought a conductor 
was supposed to look like. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiedler conducted the Pops from 1930 until he died in 1979. Film  
composer John Williams came in 1980 and Lockhart succeeded him five 
years ago. For TV, Lockhart says, the Boston Pops conductor should 
be a personality. ``The conductor needs to be somebody the public 
associates with something exciting and fun. Hopefully, that'll be 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People tell Lockhart that he projects high energy on the podium  
and jumps around a lot. He insists it's a spontaneous response to 
the music. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Lockhart also became conductor of the Utah Symphony.  
``We live in a very crossover-oriented sort of age,'' he says. 
``Dawn Upshaw doesn't worry if she sings a Rodgers and Hart show 
that nobody will hire her to sing an opera again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Upshaw sings Rodgers and Hart in a 1997 ``Evening at  
Pops'' that airs again, July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Pops plays some 62 performances in its May into July  
season in Symphony Hall. Since 1929, it has given a week of free 
concerts on Boston's Esplanade. The July 4 concert there is 
broadcast by A&AMP;E, which also televises one of three weeks of 
concerts in Symphony Hall during the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
	Guests are chosen by Lockhart and William Cosel, who has  
produced ``Evening at Pops'' since the beginning. They're most 
interested in people who don't regularly perform with orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes those performers get a little bit rattled,''  
Lockhart says. ``Sometimes we have to do restarts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last season, Arlo Guthrie was on. He's so used to being on  
stage with himself and a guitar -- and we had all these people -- 
that he couldn't remember the words to a couple of songs he's sung 
forever. He was endearing about it. The performance ended up being 
wonderful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Guthrie concert -- violinist Gil Shaham joins in on ``Arlo's  
Rag'' -- will be rebroadcast Aug. 26.

<HEADLINE> Texas A&AMP;M Coach Gets New Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- R.C. Slocum, the winningest  
football coach in Texas A&AMP;M history, received a new contract worth 
$7 million over the next seven years, athletic director Wally Groff 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Slocum's new deal is an increase of $220,000 per year over his  
old seven-year rollover contract. Slocum's base salary increased 
from $185,000 to $300,000 and became effective June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of Slocum's package will come from radio and television  
money, a housing allowance, cars, a country club membership and a 
shoe contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this package is comparable to other top football  
coaches in the country and R.C. Slocum is among the top coaches in 
the country,'' Groff said. ``He has gone about his business in a 
classy manner and has done so with a high regard to compliance with 
NCAA and Big 12 rules. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Slocum's record of 94-28-2 is fifth winningest among active  
Division I head coaches. He led the Aggies to the Big 12 
championship this past season. Under his guidance, the Aggies have 
won two Big 12 South titles and three Southwest Conference 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 10 years Texas A&AMP;M finished in the Top 20 national  
rankings and the team has played in eight bowl games, five on New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Texas A&AMP;M is a very special place to me and I appreciate the  
support of (A&AMP;M president) Dr. Ray Bowen, Wally Groff and the 
entire Aggie family,'' Slocum said. ``I've been fortunate to have 
outstanding players and assistant coaches. We will continue to work 
hard to bring success to the football program.''

<HEADLINE> John Lennon's Drawings on Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVERPOOL, England (AP) -- A collection of drawings by John  
Lennon that trace his life from the later days of the Beatles to 
the birth of his son Sean has gone on display. 
</P>
<P>
	The permanent display of limited edition prints, unveiled  
Tuesday, is housed at Liverpool's Matthew Street Gallery, yards 
away from the site of the Cavern Club, where the Beatles once 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	The prints date to 1968 and show the years Lennon spent with  
Yoko Ono, starting with their meeting, their famous bed-in for 
world peace at the Amsterdam Hilton and the birth of Sean. 
</P>
<P>
	``Drawn by one of the most important cultural figures of our  
time, these graphics celebrate human love and communication -- two 
themes at the heart of John Lennon's contribution to the art of the 
twentieth century,'' said gallery spokeswoman Christine Colvin.

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes To Repay U.N. Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate gave near-unanimous approval on  
Tuesday to legislation to pay nearly $1 billion of the country's 
longstanding debt to the United Nations but conditioned it on a 
reduction in future U.S. assessments. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Holbrooke, President Clinton's nominee to be U.N.  
ambassador, immediately promised to support the lower American 
share and to fight in New York for other cost-cutting changes 
sought by U.S. lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Budgetary discipline will be my watchword,'' Holbrooke told  
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On a 98-1 tally, the Senate approved a State Department bill  
that would reduce the maximum U.S. share of the regular U.N. budget 
from the present 25 percent to 20 percent. It would also drop the 
U.S. share of peacekeeping operations from 31 percent to 25 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the bill would free payments of $819 million in  
U.S. debts to the United Nations over three years and forgive $107 
million that the United Nations owes the United States; for a total 
repayment package of $926 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has warned the United States that it will  
lose its General Assembly voting rights if at least $250 million of 
the back dues isn't paid by December. The United States has been 
late on its payments for the past 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall measure, a $6.4 billion two-year State Department  
spending bill, now goes to the House, where similar legislation in 
the past became snarled in an unrelated dispute over abortion. Such 
an entanglement looms as a possibility again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the Senate's approval  
of the bill to make partial payment of U.S. arrears to the United 
Nations, said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard. ``He hopes that this 
will be a first step towards the United States making good on its 
obligations to the United Nations,'' Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials contend the United States owes some $1.5 billion.  
The United States disputes that level, putting the total amount in 
arrears at slightly over $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also calls for spending $3 billion over the next five  
years to beef up security at U.S. embassies around the world -- the 
same amount requested by the administration in the aftermath of 
last year's attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority party Republicans have long called for reducing the  
U.S. share of maintaining the United Nations. With the Clinton 
administration now also supporting the plan, Democrats registered 
only token opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The money we are paying has been heavily conditioned,'' said  
Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., the only senator to vote against the 
bill. ``Important U.S. interests are undermined by our failure to 
pay what we owe.'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., campaigning in New 
Hampshire, was the only senator to miss the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The reduction in payments would be unilateral, made over  
expected U.N. objections. The U.N. General Assembly in the past has 
opposed efforts to trim the U.S. share. 
</P>
<P>
	The delinquent payments would go both toward U.N. accounts and  
toward reimbursing allies for part of their costs of participating 
in U.N. peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also seeks to impose new conditions on the  
United Nations, including a demand that the world organization not 
charge the United States interest on the arrears, not take steps to 
create a standing army, not seek to levy taxes on Americans and not 
seek to exercise sovereignty over U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote coincided with the second in a series of three  
confirmation hearings on Holbrooke scheduled by the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee -- and focusing on Tuesday on the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., characterized the  
185-nation body as a ``dysfunctional organization'' and sought to 
extract a pledge from Holbrooke to support the restrictions and 
conditions imposed by the bill passed earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke gave it readily, calling it ``my highest priority'' if  
confirmed, and if the bill repaying the arrears is also passed by 
the House and sent to Clinton to be signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Tuesday, Helms took issue through a spokesman with the  
contention by U.N. spokesman Eckhard that the proposed payment of 
arrears was a first step. ``This is payment in full,'' said Helms 
spokesman Marc Thiessen. ``If the United Nations is expecting more 
money, they're sadly mistaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Holbrooke's nomination was held up a full year while  
first the administration and then the Foreign Relations Committee 
examined a range of conflict-of-interest allegations, his 
confirmation is now widely expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, an investment banker who has been a career diplomat,  
most recently as the Clinton administration's special envoy for the 
Balkans, was grilled by Helms about a 1982 essay he wrote for The 
New York Times in which he characterized the U.N. ambassador as 
sort of a ``second secretary of state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms asked him if he still believed that. Holbrooke smiled and  
suggested his views now were a little different. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can only have one secretary of state,'' Holbrooke said.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Soars on Tight Refined Supply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sugar futures raced to four-month highs Tuesday on the Board of  
Trade of the City of New York as the market continued to struggle 
with tight supplies of refined white sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, crude fell sharply, while grain and soybeans  
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures have been on the rise ahead of Russia's  
implementation of a 45 percent duty on new imports beginning Aug. 
1. Shipments must be loaded and delivered to importers by the date 
to avoid the increased taxes, which are as low as 1 percent for raw 
sugar, as that country moves to protect domestic growers. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is the world's largest sugar importer, but shipments this  
year to that country have been sharply lower because of economic 
turmoil. Importers' sudden scramble to beat the duties, however, 
has temporarily depleted coffers of refined white sugar in parts of 
Europe, resulting in the price increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts note, however, that the situation cannot last. Brazil,  
the world's largest producer, is in the middle of harvesting yet 
another bumper crop, and Europe also is expected to produce a 
good-sized sugar beet crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw sugar for October delivery jumped .21 cent to 6.42 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude tumbled in the last minutes of trading on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange as speculators bet new inventory data would 
show stockpiles remain adequate for summer refining needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute's weekly report has repeatedly  
defied industry expectations, as erratic American driving patterns 
during the peak consumption period clash with a year-over-year 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants expected the API to report increased crude  
and heating oil stockpiles in the past week as cargoes arrived from 
Europe. American refiners also have been reluctant to process crude 
because of relatively poor profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	July crude fell 9 cents to $17.61 a barrel; July unleaded  
gasoline fell .03 cent to 51.15 cents a gallon; July heating fell 
.27 cent to 43.62 cents a gallon; July natural gas rose .01 cent to 
$2.238 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures prices sank on the Chicago Board of  
Trade amid a weather outlook that appeared favorable for 
development and harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by forecasts for clear, dry weather  
in coming days that could get harvesting back on track in winter 
wheat growing areas. The forecast reversed early support from rains 
that were falling in some Plains growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans and corn retreated amid expectations rains across the  
Midwest will prove beneficial to crop development. Agronomists also 
noted that hot weather could have little effect on the hardier 
soybean plants, and higher temperatures were not expected to reduce 
corn yields at this point in the growing season. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat fell 4 1/2 cents to $2.50 1/4 a bushel; July corn fell 3  
cents to $2.16 1/4 a bushel; July oats fell 2 1/4 cents to $1.13 a 
bushel; July soybeans fell 3 3/4 cents to $4.67 3/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Energy Dep't To Give Polygraph Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department plans to give lie  
detector tests to as many as 5,000 nuclear weapons scientists and 
other employees in sensitive jobs with wholesale testing to begin 
later this summer, senior department officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-six counterintelligence officers, including some at the  
nuclear weapons laboratories, already have volunteered to take the 
polygraph tests, said Edward J. Curran, director of the DOE's 
Office of Counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Curran said in an interview Monday that by September the  
department will have the ability to test at the rate of more than 
200 people a month. The plans call for testing about 2,500 
scientists and other workers in the first year and renewed tests 
every five years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first time any agency outside of the Central  
Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency engaged in 
widespread use of polygraph tests on workers. The FBI uses the 
devices to screen prospective employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of widespread use of polygraph tests on thousands  
of workers, including most of the nuclear weapons scientists at the 
research labs, has raised concern among scientists at the labs. 
Some lab managers worry that the research facilities may lose top 
scientists to universities where they would not be subjected to 
such scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is concern about the reliability of the polygraph,  
known informally as a lie detector, and the potential for 
career-ending ``false positive'' mistakes. Polygraph results are 
not admissible in court because of their reliability. In January, a 
number of CIA employees filed a lawsuit in connection with the spy 
agency's use of polygraph tests in internal security and 
disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
	Curran said the tests, which will be administered by  
contractors, will be ``very focused.'' Main questions will be 
limited to ``deal only with espionage'' and not personal or 
``lifestyle'' matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been very careful that we have everybody's concerns  
addressed. This is a technique that is used in the interest of 
protecting national security. The more focused it is, the better 
the results,'' said Curran. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in April that he planned  
to require polygraph tests on department employees with top secret 
``Q'' clearances as part of a broader program to beef up security 
and anti-espionage programs at the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a report by a panel of the president's International  
Intelligence Advisory Board, in a broad review of security at the 
DOE's nuclear weapons facilities, questioned why polygraph testing 
was not already being used more widely. It noted that a 
presidential security directive in February 1998 called for such 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Curran said the three nuclear weapons labs -- Los Alamos, Sandia,  
and Lawrence Livermore -- as well as other department offices 
currently are assembling the names of those who will be subjected 
to the tests. He said he will have final say on who is tested. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're off and running. We started the program at the end of  
April,'' said Curran, a veteran FBI agent and counterintelligence 
expert who was the first to voluntarily submit to the test. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulation covering the tests will be put into the Federal  
Register soon, possibly this week, and a 30-day comment period will 
follow before the general testing program can begin, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Curran said he doesn't expect a flood of volunteers,  
particularly from the weapons research labs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not hammering at my door,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Computer Counts Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak has developed a handheld computer that  
will allow it to maintain an up-to-the-moment passenger count 
aboard its trains, a concern after this year's crash in 
Bourbonnais, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer, built by the Illinois-based Motorola Inc., will be  
unveiled Wednesday during a news conference in Washington. The 
system will go into use later this year when Amtrak's high-speed 
``Acela'' service begins between Boston, New York and Washington. 
It will spread to the rest of the national railroad's trains by the 
fall of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The handheld unit was created to let conductors collect fares  
and issue seat checks more easily on board a train. As a conductor 
passes through a car, a passenger count in the computer will be 
updated with each passenger marked off or seat check issued. The 
system will also allow Amtrak to list the names of the passengers 
on board its many reserved trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current system, conductors collect paper tickets and  
issue paper receipts on board. The railroad doesn't have an 
accurate count of the passengers or a list of their names until a 
trip is completed and the stubs are reconciled with a computerized 
reservation system. 
</P>
<P>
	In the immediate aftermath of the March 15 collision between an  
Amtrak passenger train and a steel-hauling truck in Bourbonnais, 
the National Transportation Safety Board questioned whether it had 
a current count or list of the passengers on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven people were killed and more than 100 injured in the crash  
of the City of New Orleans train, which was traveling from Chicago 
to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	The new $24 million system has been under development since May  
1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: World Better Prepared for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Venezuela is consulting with psychiatrists on  
how to explain to the public what might happen with the Year 2000 
computer bug. The Philippines wants to bring the bug to the dinner 
table -- as a conversation topic. And countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa are worried about finding enough experts to get rid of the 
bug. 
</P>
<P>
	John Koskinen, head of President Clinton's Council on Year 2000  
Conversion, says he's delighted the world is finally focusing on 
Y2K problems and cooperating in trying to solve them. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months after the first global conference on the millennium  
bug, experts from over 170 countries meet today at the United 
Nations to assess progress in dealing with Year 2000 problems and 
preparations for coping with possible computer glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sense is there has been a sea change in the preparedness of  
the world in the last six months,'' Koskinen told reporters Monday. 
``Nobody is saying this isn't a problem. So what we now have, I 
think, is a race to the finish line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem -- also called Y2K and the millennium bug --  
occurs because some computer programs, especially older ones, may 
fail when the date changes to 2000. Because they were written to 
recognize only the last two digits of a year, such programs could 
read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, I think developing countries are going to have more  
problems than developed countries, but when the dust settles ... it 
wouldn't surprise me to find that we have more failures in 
developed countries because we have far more systems,'' Kostikon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. companies and the government are probably spending $80  
billion to $100 billion to cope with the millennium bug, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Monday's press conference, Y2K coordinators from Europe,  
Asia, the Americas and Australia provided a glimpse of some of the 
problems and challenges they face. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Tagarinski said the 29 countries in East and Central  
Europe and Central Asia need independent assessments of their Y2K 
problems -- and help to fix them. One country, Yugoslavia, hasn't 
even been heard from on the millennium bug issue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether media reports that there would be a variety of  
failures and meltdowns in the region were fair, Tagarinski replied 
to laughter: ``Yeah, maybe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the spectrum, Venezuela has invested $200  
million to ensure oil is delivered on time and the country's Y2K 
oil expert, Ivan Crespo, said all critical components in the oil 
industry will be fixed by August. 
</P>
<P>
	But Venezuela's national coordinator, Hugo Castellanos, the  
government doesn't know how to communicate with the people about 
the Y2K problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how to explain to the large population now what  
is going to happen, because we don't know what's going to happen,'' 
he said. ``We are talking to psychologists, psychiatrists in order 
to know how to reach the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amable Aguiluz of The Philippines, the East Asia and Pacific  
regional coordinator, said the media was crucial in raising 
awareness of the millennium bug. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our ultimate objective is to bring Y2K to the dinner table of  
every Filipino,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Aguiluz said he was concerned that some groups might take  
advantage of the computer problem. Some religious groups have 
already told members they would be willing to take care of their 
money to avoid Y2K problems, Aguiluz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baba Mustafa Marong, the sub-Saharan Africa coordinator, said  
his region not only needs more computer experts but is concerned 
about small and medium enterprises, ``where you don't know the 
extent of their exposure to the Y2K bug.''

	Kosovo Rebels Want To Keep Weapons  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Only a day after pledging to  
warehouse their weapons and end their fight, a top Kosovo 
Liberation Army leader said today the rebels never agreed to give 
up their guns and still hope to form an army. ``The agreement does 
not demand that we give up our arms,'' Rrustem Mustafa told the 
rebels' Kosova Press news service. The agreement reached yesterday 
between NATO and the KLA calls for the rebels and peacekeepers to 
have joint control over the weapons storehouses for 90 days, after 
which the insurgent army is to disband as a military force.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An international war crimes investigation will  
focus on Russians who fought in Kosovo alongside Serb forces, the 
Pentagon's spokesman said today. ``We certainly know that Russians 
participated. Russian volunteers, mercenaries, we believe, did 
participate with paramilitary and other Serb forces,'' Kenneth 
Bacon said. Bacon also said nearly 400 U.S. planes will return to 
normal duty in coming weeks after having participated in NATO 
aistrikes against Yugoslavia.

he intends to run for the White House despite Texas Gov. George 
Bush's standing as a prohibitive front-runner for the GOP 
nomination, a Republican official said today. The official, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity, said Hatch declared his intentions 
at a meeting of supporters Friday night in Salt Lake City. Hatch's 
aides said to expect an announcement in the next week. But many of 
his colleagues considered a Hatch candidacy a foregone conclusion.

his Chief of Staff John Podesta said today. Podesta said the 
Clinton administration will begin to shift its attention to 
domestic policy. Some Democrats fear that a vote against the 
National Rifle Association will unleash massive organizing 
campaigns to defeat them in the next election. Podesta said Clinton 
would use his office to explain the Democrats' case on gun control

their votes.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA today launched an effort to repair a  
game that many believe has become too rough, with not enough 
scoring. A committee of past and present basketball players, 
coaches and front office figures began its review by focusing on 
four areas: how a game is officiated, illegal defense guidelines, 
backing down rules, and determining when the shot clock will be 
recycled. Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, hopes changes 
could be in place in time for next season.

<HEADLINE> Woman Wins False Memory Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A woman who said her therapist convinced  
her she had been raped by a satanic cult and had killed an infant 
was awarded $200,000 by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury Monday held Leah Strout Simpson to be 35 percent at  
fault for what happened to her. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Simpson began seeing therapist Roger Litwin in 1986, when  
she was in her early 20s. The therapist began treating her for 
multiple personality disorder, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she spent years believing she had been involved in  
ritual abuse and murder, and became suicidally depressed, before 
realizing that what she thought were long-repressed memories were 
untrue. 
</P>
<P>
	The therapist's lawyer, Sharon Hightower, said Litwin's  
diagnosis and treatment were within the professional mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no suggestion that her memories were implanted or  
suggested by Litwin,'' Ms. Hightower told the jury.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Makes Plea to Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- President Clinton is making a personal  
plea to the war-scarred refugees he is meeting in the muddy tent 
encampments less than 10 miles from the Kosovo border: 
reconciliation and rebuilding -- not revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that ethnic cleansing has been defeated in Kosovo, we must  
build something better in its place,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton arrived in Skopje today for his first trip to the front  
lines of the battle he and his NATO allies won against what he 
called the ``murderous rule'' of Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving at Skopje's airport, the military personnel aboard Air  
Force One donned bullet-proof vests, and explained that under 
Defense Department rules they were entitled to hazard pay for their 
time in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is wrapping up a weeklong trip that won commitment from  
the European Union to help in the costly reconstruction of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must build a Europe with no front-line states, a Europe  
undivided, democratic and at peace for the first time in history,'' 
he declared before going to Skopje, Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	For some 17,000 remaining refugees at camp Stenkovic I outside  
Skopje, news reports since the Serb retreat from Kosovo -- NATO 
troops finding burned-out homes, mass graves and witnesses to 
systematic rape and slaughter -- are intensely personal heartbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The president says he wants Kosovo's ethnic Albanians not to let  
that heartbreak turn to anger and revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't, in the end, satisfy anyone. It will only compound  
the horror,'' Clinton said Monday, when asked about reports of 
retaliatory violence by the Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA, which has moved back into Kosovo alongside NATO  
peacekeepers, signed an agreement this week to surrender its 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Clinton also was meeting the leaders of Macedonia and  
Albania, who opened their borders to the nearly 1 million Kosovo 
Albanians who fled Serb troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to demonstrate his appreciation for the cooperation  
and support these countries gave in the face of some very difficult 
circumstances over the last few months. And he wants to do that 
personally,'' said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia and Albania are to be included in the longer-term  
stability package of aid to Southeastern Europe agreed upon by the 
world's industrial powers at their weekend summit in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	En route back to Washington, Clinton and his family stop in  
Aviano, Italy, to greet U.S. forces who took part in the NATO 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 350 military planes and their crews -- about half the  
number of U.S. aircraft that flew during the 11 weeks of bombing -- 
were beginning the trip home from Europe as early as today, the 
Pentagon announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton returns home girded for a public-relations battle to win  
from Congress the U.S. share of redevelopment aid to Kosovo, though 
Congress has already balked at paying for peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will probably cost more than most people think,'' he  
acknowledged. ``But ... it will be phenomenally less expensive than 
a land invasion of Kosovo and a protracted conflict would have 
been.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Has U.S. Buying War Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government would contribute up to  
$4.25 million to buy land to protect the Paoli and Brandywine 
battlefields in Pennsylvania, two significant Revolutionary War 
sites, under a bill the House passed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, passed 418-4, the money must be matched  
dollar-for-dollar with private money. 
</P>
<P>
	Paoli Battlefield is a 40-acre tract in suburban Philadelphia  
where more than 50 Americans died in September 1777. It was the 
third major battle in the failed campaign to prevent British 
capture of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The money also would be used to preserve a section of the nearby  
Brandywine Battlefield, where troops fought less than two weeks 
before Paoli. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would authorize the National Park Service to provide  
money to Malvern, Pa., and the state to purchase the necessary 
land. It also instructs the Interior Department to conduct a study 
once the land has been bought. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- To outsiders, the charismatic and  
impeccably dressed Mayor Willie Brown exudes as much panache as San 
Francisco itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the mayor, I can proclaim anything I want,'' he announced  
in a recent appearance with a flip of a flowing red robe, a 
gleaming crown on his head. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance, in a skit to celebrate the city's  
longest-running musical, worked as real-life political theater: 
There's little doubt who rules San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	But locals may have had enough of the polished politician whose  
re-election campaign slogan touts, ``He's One of a Kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With less than five months before the election, there's lots of  
talk of ousting one of California's most powerful Democrats from 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty challengers have filed declarations of intent with the  
Department of Elections, which allows them to campaign and raise 
money for the race. The deadline to get on the ballot is Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the only serious contenders who have announced their  
candidacy are millionaire political consultant Clint Reilly and 
former Republican Mayor Frank Jordan, whom Brown unseated in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Other possible candidates include Board of Supervisors President  
Tom Ammiano; Adam Werbach, the 26-year-old former president of the 
Sierra Club; and activist Jim Reid, who spent nine days living on 
the streets and in shelters to highlight the plight of the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's struggle to hold on to his job was graphically shown in  
a mid-May San Francisco Examiner-KTVU poll. It found that 71 
percent of respondents were unhappy with his job performance, 
compared with 59 percent in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, which had a margin of error of 4 percentage points,  
found that if the mayoral election were held immediately, 34 
percent would vote for Brown, 19 percent for Ammiano, 18 percent 
for Jordan and 9 percent for Reilly. Twenty percent were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown has never lost a campaign since he first sought elected  
office in 1964. Since his inauguration as mayor, the former 
California Assembly speaker has gotten high marks for helping 
create jobs and improve the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But voters are highly critical of the local transportation  
system, Municipal Railway, which Brown vowed to fix within 100 days 
of taking office. He admits he hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	He has also been criticized for crackdowns on the homeless and  
the perennial parking crunch in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, campaigns don't usually gain momentum until Labor Day,  
and an unexpected event could have a telling effect. In the last 
mayoral race, Brown got a boost when Jordan jumped in a shower with 
two male disc jockeys in a campaign stunt that backfired. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown kicked off his re-election campaign last weekend with  
support from Gov. Gray Davis and President Clinton. His lively 
speech touted lower crime rates, and he promised again to improve 
the railway and make housing more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a delicate city -- it's actually a museum,'' Brown  
said. ``And those of us who are elected officials are curators of 
that museum. And each of you are one of the choice art pieces in 
that museum. I want to continue to be your curator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some feel they've heard it before.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the city has pretty much stagnated,'' Anne Rosinski  
said. ``My impression of Mayor Brown is sort of like Eva Peron. 
He's very good about announcing his programs, but there doesn't 
seem to be a lot of follow through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backers say Brown has more than earned the right to a second  
term. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no matching Willie Brown and his ability to take care  
of San Francisco,'' said Betty Brooks, who works for the city's 
housing authority. ``If there's anybody with a magic wand who can 
step forward, I challenge them.''

<HEADLINE> Grains Mixed; Soybeans Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures prices were mixed early today on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures found support on forecasts for rains that continue  
to delay harvesting of the winter wheat crop, which provides the 
majority of the nation's wheat production. Foul weather has 
repeatedly delayed harvesting in the Plains, leaving crops 
vulnerable to pests and disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were pressured, however, by forecasts for clear, dry  
weather in coming days that could get harvesting back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures found support from forecasts for above-normal  
temperatures in major growing areas, including Iowa, which often is 
the nation's largest producer. But near-term forecasts showed 
moderate temperatures and ample rainfall, pressuring futures 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans edged lower amid expectations rains across the Midwest  
will prove beneficial to crop development. Agronomists also noted 
that hot weather could have little effect on the hardier soybean 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1/4 cent to $2.55 a bushel; July corn  
fell 1/2 cent to $2.18 3/4 a bushel; July oats fell 3/4 cent to $1.14 1/2 a 
bushel; July soybeans fell 1 1/2 cents to $4.70 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .13 cent to 63.65 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .22 cent to 77.12 cents a pound; July lean hogs 
rose .55 cent to 51.55 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .45 
cent to 44.25 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> 'Hood' Director Sentenced in Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Boyz 'N The Hood'' director John Singleton  
has been ordered to produce a 15- to 30-minute film on domestic 
violence in connection with an assault on the mother of one of his 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Singleton, 31, was sentenced Tuesday after pleading no contest  
to one count of battery. The judge also placed Singleton on three 
years probation and ordered him to attend domestic violence 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Rosewood'' director was charged with the misdemeanor count  
after a Jan. 2 argument that began when the 28-year-old mother of 
his 6-year-old daughter arrived at his home to pick up the girl. 
The names of the mother and daughter were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim and an unidentified woman friend who accompanied her  
to Singleton's home told police Singleton struck his ex-girlfriend 
repeatedly with his fist. The two said he grabbed her neck, choked 
her and yelled at her to leave his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The two women said that Singleton ended the attack when his  
daughter pleaded with him to stop hitting her mother, said Deputy 
City Attorney Robert Cha.

<HEADLINE> California Condemns Synagogue Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California's leaders are loudly  
denouncing the arson fires that struck three Sacramento area 
synagogues, saying prejudice and hatred must not be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Assembly on Monday unanimously approved a resolution  
calling the fires one of the worst acts of anti-Semitism in 
American history. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, some of the state's top leaders joined more than  
2,000 people for a ``united against hate'' rally at the Sacramento 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot pretend to know what you are feeling,'' Sharon Davis,  
wife of Gov. Gray Davis, told members of the three Jewish 
congregations in the audience. ``But I do know this: You are not 
alone. The heart of this community and the entire state of 
California aches with yours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fires were set within minutes of each other early Friday at the  
150-year-old B'nai Israel and two suburban temples, the 
Congregation Beth Shalom and the Kenesset Israel Torah Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The arson caused about $1 million in damage, including  
destruction of B'nai Israel's 5,000-volume library. Anti-Jewish 
fliers were found at two of the crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no suspects, FBI spokesman Nick Rossi said.  
</P>
<P>
	Assembly members spent nearly an hour Monday morning speaking in  
favor of a resolution condemning the attacks. They passed it 
unanimously and sent it to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Anapolsky, president of Congregation B'nai Israel, said  
the attacks resulted in an outpouring of condolences and offers of 
aid from people of all faiths around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``In times of crisis like this, all that can do is strengthen  
our resolve to go forward and lift our spirits,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anapolsky said B'nai Israel hopes to open at least part of the  
synagogue property to the congregation and public Thursday so they 
can see the damage. Counselors will be on hand to help those upset 
by the sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see what is behind that wall it will take your breath  
away,'' he said. ``People need to see the totality of the 
destruction.''

<HEADLINE> Indians' Success Comes Easily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The top of the lineup typically sets the table  
for the power hitters anyway it can. The Indians' 1-2-3 punch of 
Kenny Lofton, Omar Vizquel and Roberto Alomar is a little 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, they set the table. They also clear it and don't mind  
breaking a few glasses and dishes in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's a bottom line as to why the Indians are averaging  
nearly seven runs a game this season and leading the majors in wins 
and virtually every offensive category, it's the top of their 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton, Vizquel and Alomar have become three of the most  
terrifying words known to AL pitchers. They can run. They can 
score. They steal bases, drive in runs and drive opposing managers 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only are they experienced, they're aggressive,'' Seattle  
left-hander Jamie Moyer said before facing the Indians on Monday. 
``They can beat you with their legs, they can beat you with the 
short ball and they can beat you long. They're very, very tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three are batting well over .300 and rank in the AL's top 10  
in average, on-base percentage and stolen bases. In fact, the 
Indians are the only team in the majors with three players with 
more than 16 steals, and guess who they are? 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, Lofton and Alomar rank 1-2 in the league in runs  
and both are in the top five in walks. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no wonder Indians cleanup hitter Manny Ramirez is leading  
the majors with 79 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cleveland signed Alomar as a free agent last November,  
manager Mike Hargrove finally had the second baseman he always 
wanted and perhaps the best No. 2 hitter in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, though, had other designs for Alomar and decided to  
use him in the No. 3 slot, with Lofton leading off and Vizquel 
batting second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just pulled a rabbit out of the hat,'' Hargrove said of a  
decision that's been nothing short of magical. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, your third hitter should be your best average hitter, a  
guy who uses the bat well and puts the ball in play, and Robbie 
fits there,'' Hargrove said. ``Robbie is a run producer, obviously, 
but he serves more as a transition from setting the table to the 
power guys. Every night, there's a very good chance one of our top 
three will be on base for Ramirez, (Jim) Thome or (David) 
Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians, who have scored in double digits 14 times this  
season, are on pace to break the 1931 New York Yankees' record for 
runs in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove didn't have any particular numbers in mind when he  
decided on the Lofton-Vizquel-Alomar attack, but he also didn't 
expect it to add up to these early results, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never try to anticipate those kinds numbers so I won't be  
disappointed,'' he said. ``I did imagine us hitting on all 
cylinders, and that's what has happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, whose game has been rejuvenated with the move to  
Cleveland, is having an MVP-caliber season. He's already stolen 
more bases (20) than he did in all of 1998 (18) for Baltimore and 
he's on pace for career highs in homers and RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland seems to suit the All-Star second baseman as well as  
his new role as a No. 3 hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys in front of me can both run and hit and do the little  
things right,'' Alomar said. ``Then we leave it up to Manny and the 
guys behind him to drive in runs. We're all getting on base, then 
doing little things to put pressure on the opposing team.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	The Women's World Cup is setting record ticket sales for a  
women's sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
	Marla Messing, president of the organizing committee, said  
Tuesday that the tournament had sold more than a half-million 
tickets. The first-round doubleheader in Chicago featuring Brazil 
vs. Italy and the United States vs. Nigeria is sold out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have exceeded our greatest expectations,'' said Messing.  
``To average more than 19,000 fans at the three non-USA 
doubleheaders is the strongest statement we could make that the 
Women's World Cup has been embraced by this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the first weekend, the tournament drew 134,245 fans to  
stadiums in East Rutherford, N.J.; San Jose, Calif; Foxboro, Mass.; 
and Pasadena, Calif. The 1995 World Cup in Sweden sold only 112,000 
tickets for the entire tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	As Messing noted, fans are buying tickets for more non-U.S.  
first round matches. Tickets sales for Saturdays two doubleheaders 
are also looking good. The Giants Stadium matches of Canada-Russia 
and China-Australia has sold more than 29,000 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghana meets Sweden and Norway faces Japan in Chicago on  
Saturday, and ticket sales there where over 32,000 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's matches sold 17,000 tickets for the Norway-Canada,  
Australia-Sweden showdowns in Landover, Md., and 16,000 for the 
Portland matchups of Japan-Russia and China-Ghana. 
</P>
<P>

	 *SWEDES AT WHITE HOUSE:* The Swedish team took some time off  
from practice Tuesday to visit the White House. The Swedes toured 
the White House for about an hour. When asked about the tour, 
Sweden's Malin Andersson said it was ``real nice''. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also visited the Lincoln Monument and plans to do some  
more sightseeing in Washington. They'll have to see how it fits 
into their busy training schedule, though. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedes face Australia at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium on  
Wednesday. Swedish goalkeeper Ulrika Karlson was confident the team 
could take Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should beat them,'' she said. ``It's going to be difficult,  
but we should take them.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *INJURIES:* It's still unsure if Canadian forward Silvana  
Burtini will be able to play in Wednesday's match with Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking to play, because obviously that's what I came here  
for,'' said Burtini. ``But right now it's just day-to-day and I'll 
have to wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada has a big challenge against defending champion Norway.  
</P>
<P>
	Burtini aggravated a hamstring injury when she scored the only  
Canadian goal in the opening game tie with Japan. She was kept out 
of practice on Monday, only jogging slowly around the practice 
field at George Mason University. 
</P>
<P>
	China's top player, Weng Sun, also injured her leg in the first  
game against Sweden. When the Chinese team arrived in Portland to 
prepare for Wednesday's match against Ghana, Weng was limping. 
</P>
<P>
	As China's practice sessions are closed, it's unclear if Weng's  
injury kept her from working out. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DEFENDING NORWAY:* Even though Norway is the defending Women's  
World Cup champion, the U.S. team is getting a lot more media 
attention. So how do the Norwegians feel about all the focus being 
placed on the United States? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's OK,'' said Norway coach Per-Mathias Hogmo. ``I think it's  
natural that we play in the U.S., and the U.S. are getting a lot of 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marianne Pettersen, the Norwegian forward, said the U.S. team  
being in the spotlight might be a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's OK, because in a way they get all the pressure  
and we become sort of the outsiders,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogmo was confident his team's style of play will woo fans.  
</P>
<P>
	``We play attractive, attacking football,'' he said, ``It must  
be OK to see Norway play.''

	 *AUSTRALIAN U.S. HOMECOMING:* Wednesday's Australia-Sweden match  
in Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in Landover, Md., will be a kind of 
homecoming for Australian forward Julie Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray lived in nearby McLean, Va., from 1979-1982 while her  
father worked at the Australian Embassy. The Mathildas' forward 
also started her soccer career in the United States, playing for a 
intramural team at Chesterbrook Elementary School in McLean.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- The risk of mad cow-type disease breaking out  
among people in the United States is small, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has taken steps to ban beef imports from Europe  
and to protect domestic herds from consuming ground-up sheep and 
other feed that may spread the fatal brain illness, according to a 
report in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The article, based on data collected by a research team led by  
JAMA staffer Litjen Tan, said unique circumstances existed in 
Britain in the late 1980s when an epidemic began that lasted 
through 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground-up sheep were fed to cattle in Britain, and safeguards on  
livestock feed and restrictions on infected animals were not in 
place, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mad cow disease kills by eating holes in the brain tissue of  
cattle. As of Jan. 31, a human variant, called Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
disease, had showed up in 39 Britons who apparently ate beef 
contaminated with mad cow disease. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no known mad cow disease in U.S. cattle, Tan's group  
said in the year-old report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any potential human contact with the disease agent would have  
to come from the importation of contaminated cattle products or 
exposure while traveling'' in countries that have the disease, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	A critic of the beef industry said the report is ``falsely  
reassuring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Stauber, executive director of the Center for Media &AMP;  
Democracy and co-author of ``Mad Cow U.S.A.,'' said a mad cow-like 
disease has appeared in deer and elk in Western states. Michael 
Hansen of the Consumers Union of Yonkers, N.Y., said that deer and 
elk can be used in livestock feed.

<HEADLINE> House May Accept Bill on Y2K Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Republican leadership is discussing  
whether to accept a more moderate Senate version of a bill aimed at 
reducing lawsuits resulting from year 2000 computer problems, GOP 
sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said he was ready to  
move the Senate bill on the floor Thursday, putting it on an 
express path for passage and a showdown with the White House. But 
GOP sources cautioned that no final decision had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	If the House accepts the Senate bill, passed last week by a  
62-37 margin, it would remove a major obstacle to congressional 
passage of legislation avidly backed by business and high tech 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Still ahead, however,is an even greater hurdle -- a veto threat  
from the White House. The Clinton administration prefers the Senate 
bill but says it still goes too far in restricting the rights of 
citizens to win damages for losses incurred if computer systems 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey said at a news conference that the House was willing to  
adopt the Senate bill, which he called ``the minimal version in 
terms of the good that can be done'' to ease the litigation fears 
of the technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey said the House could vote on the Senate bill, possibly  
with a ``modest'' amendment that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., wants to add. That addition would require one more Senate 
vote before it goes to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, sponsored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., Ron  
Wyden, D-Ore., and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., would give people 90 
days to fix Y2K-related problems before lawsuits could be filed and 
encourages out-of-court mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	It sets a punitive damage cap for small business defendants,  
limits class action lawsuits and, heads off possible attempts to 
sue the richest companies by stipulating that, in most cases, 
companies are liable only for that share of the damages they cause. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim is to stop what businesses fear could be hundreds of  
billions of dollars in frivolous or predatory lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The House version passed last month went further in offering  
punitive damage caps to all defendants who make a good faith effort 
to correct problems, extending proportionate liability to more 
defendants and including a loser-pay provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Tuesday, the Senate Appropriations Committee and the  
special Senate panel on Y2K issues heard testimony predicting that 
it would cost federal government $8.7 billion to fix the millennium 
bug of computers that mistake the year 2000 for 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	That was up from an estimate of $2.3 billion in February 1997.  
The General Accounting Office, the investigative wing of Congress 
that prepared the report, said the final cost figure could go still 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO's David Walker said the final cost is still unclear  
because there are questions about how well the states, which work 
with the federal government in food stamp, Medicaid and other 
programs, have done in addressing their own Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He said government spending on computers and other information  
technology equipment could also go up in the future because many 
agencies have put off technology spending this year to concentrate 
on the Y2K problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jacob Lew, director of the White House Office of Management  
and Budget, said Y2K planning has gone well and he didn't expect a 
sharp jump in technology spending demands. ``I wouldn't put up a 
red flag that there's a crisis looming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An emergency spending bill passed by Congress last year included  
more than $3 billion to pay for Y2k-related repairs and planning.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Hears Holbrooke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Veteran diplomat Richard Holbrooke is  
promising the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that overhaul of 
questionable and inefficient U.N. practices will be his ``highest 
sustained priority'' if confirmed as U.N. ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes getting other nations to support a smaller U.S.  
contribution and additional ``conditions'' the Senate put on 
legislation in exchange for agreeing to pay nearly $1 billion in 
U.S. arrears to the world body, Holbrooke said Tuesday after the 
Senate action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Budgetary discipline will be my watchword,'' Holbrooke  
promised the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of both parties said they expect Holbrooke to win Senate  
confirmation within the next few weeks, despite a year-long delay 
on the nomination caused by ethics investigations, first by the 
Clinton administration and then by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, on a 98-1 vote, the Senate approved a State  
Department bill that would reduce the maximum U.S. share of the 
regular U.N. budget from the present 25 percent to 20 percent. It 
would also drop the U.S. share of peacekeeping operations from 31 
percent to 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the bill would free payments of $819 million in  
U.S. debts to the United Nations over three years and forgive $107 
million that the United Nations owes the United States; the total 
repayment package would be $926 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has warned the United States that it will  
lose its General Assembly voting rights if at least $250 million of 
the back assessments -- some dating back 13 years -- aren't paid by 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall measure, a $6.4 billion two-year State Department  
spending bill, now goes to the House, where similar legislation in 
the past became snarled in an unrelated dispute over abortion. Such 
an entanglement again looms as a possibility this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the conditions, the Senate action to repay a big part of  
the arrears was welcomed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said 
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hopes that this will be a first step towards the United  
States making good on its obligations to the United Nations,'' 
Eckhard said. U.N. officials claim the United States owes more than 
$1.5 billion in delinquent payments. The United States disputes 
that figure, but concedes the amount is over $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
commented: ``After long experience, I'd wait until the House 
acts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within an hour after the Senate passed the bill, Holbrooke was  
before the Foreign Relations panel testifying on his views of U.N. 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also seeks to impose new conditions on the  
United Nations, including a demand that the organization not charge 
the United States interest on the arrears, not take steps to create 
a standing army, not seek to levy taxes on Americans and not seek 
to exercise sovereignty over U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke promised Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the committee  
chairman, that if confirmed he would press for the changes, along 
with others designed to open up the U.N.'s budget process and to 
streamline its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will make it my highest sustained priority,'' Holbrooke  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms characterized the United Nations as a ``dysfunctional  
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Johnson, an official with the General Accounting Office,  
Congress' investigating arm, told the committee that the United 
Nations under Annan had begun its own restructuring.This included 
the appointment of a chief operating officer and a senior 
management group to set overall policy, he said. It has also 
improved oversight and accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	But these reforms ``are not fully implemented'' and much work  
needs to be done, including keeping better track of where the 
United Nations spends its money, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	A third and final confirmation hearing on Holbrooke set for  
Thursday is expected to focus on his role in the Balkans. 
Holbrooke, a career diplomat now working at an investment bank, is 
a former assistant secretary of state and ambassador to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	He has also served as the Clinton administration's special envoy  
to the Balkans, and was the architect of the 1995 peace 
negotiations in Dayton, Ohio, which ended the war in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Boston Sued Over School Assignments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A lawsuit claims four children were wrongly denied  
admission to certain Boston public schools because of their skin 
color -- white -- and the litigation threatens to end the city's 
race-based admissions policies for good. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed 25 years to the day after U.S. District Judge  
W. Arthur Garrity Jr. ruled that segregation in Boston schools 
violated the equal protection of black children under the 14th 
Amendment of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1974 ruling instituted a controversial busing program to  
achieve more balanced racial populations in the city's schools, 
prompting violent protests among whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this prevails, we're going to guarantee a segregated  
system,'' said City Councilor Charles Yancey, who represents 
predominantly minority neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a case of regression,'' Yancey said. ``Children should  
not be restricted geographically to where they go to school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit, filed Monday, claims the students were  
unconstitutionally denied entrance to the schools and asks the 
court to throw out a School Department policy that considers race 
when assigning students to schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston school officials have argued that race-based admission  
policies are important to preserve a diverse student body. A 
federal judge rejected that argument in December, however, when it 
ruled that the city could not consider race in admissions to the 
prestigious Boston Latin School. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools Superintendent Thomas W. Payzant said Tuesday the suit  
was not surprising ``given a rising national trend toward 
litigation that contests racial guidelines in public school 
admissions processes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs say parents and students will feel more involved  
if the youngsters are allowed to attend schools closer to home, 
instead of being bused across the city to achieve racial balance. 
</P>
<P>
	One plaintiff, Rose O'Toole, said her 4-year-old son, John Jr.,  
had been denied admission to six choices of kindergarten because he 
was white. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfair for my son to be denied anything because of his  
race,'' Ms. O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, a federal appeals court said the city had achieved  
racial balance and allowed a new school busing plan to be 
implemented. The new formula, still in place today, based school 
assignments partly on race and partly on parental choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Monday's lawsuit, city officials were considering  
abandoning busing in favor of neighborhood schools, because white 
flight and a burgeoning immigrant population have dramatically 
changed the racial makeup in many parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks, Hispanics and Asians comprise about 85 percent of the  
city's 64,000 public school students, up from about 48 percent 25 
years ago.

<HEADLINE> Game 4 Will Test San Antonio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The old San Antonio Spurs were said to be softer  
than an overripe banana on a bed of Charmin. The new Spurs are 
supposed to be different. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 4 will tell.  
</P>
<P>
	A little adversity and a smidgen of self-doubt were the factors  
San Antonio had to contend with Tuesday following its loss to the 
New York Knicks in Game 3 of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs still lead the series 2-1, with Game 4 on Wednesday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to instill as much doubt as we can,'' New York's Kurt  
Thomas said. ``When you talk about demeanor, you can tell when a 
person is upset about something or down on themselves. But they 
looked the same as they did in Game 1. They kept fighting until the 
last second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Thomas didn't see was the anger in coach Gregg Popovich's  
eyes as he yelled at his team during a first-quarter timeout Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden we're playing the exact opposite from what we  
talked about for a week!'' he screamed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs trailed almost the entire game, tying it only once,  
and played their sloppiest ball in a long time. It was the first 
loss for San Antonio since May 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, who have been thriving on adversity throughout the  
season, will now try to send the Spurs to their first two-game 
losing streak since the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
	As the pressure increases each day the series moves on, the next  
test for the Spurs will be how they react to a diminished comfort 
zone and the possibility of a tied series. The last time the Spurs 
were in a similar situation, they went to Minnesota for Game 3 of 
the first round and beat the Timberwolves by 14 points to take a 
2-1 lead in that series. 
</P>
<P>
	The first round, however, is not as pressure-packed as the  
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past five years, the pressure of playing for a  
championship turned Nick Anderson into a quivering mess at the foul 
line, made Shandon Anderson turn a game-changing dunk into a blown 
reverse layup and made Karl Malone miss two game-clinching free 
throws in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been tested, they've been through adversity, and their  
guys are going to fight just like we fight,'' New York's Charlie 
Ward said. ``Pressure can be a factor if you are mentally weak, but 
I don't think those guys are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Latrell Sprewell saw a lot of San Antonio when he was in the  
Western Conference playing for Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	The conventional wisdom then on how to rattle the Spurs was  
simple: Bang them around, get into their heads and they'd crumble. 
The wore the label of ``soft'' for several seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it fit. I thought it was an unfair label. It  
was just that way because they hadn't won,'' Sprewell said. ``Now 
that they're having success and winning, it's changed their 
mentality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that mentality showed signs of stress in Game 3 Monday night  
as the Spurs lost their cool early, regained their composure 
midway, but didn't show a killer instinct when they needed it most. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Duncan suddenly lost his touch in the fourth quarter. Sean  
Elliott needed to be checked for a pulse. Mario Elie and Jaren 
Jackson were helpless when they tried to shut down Allan Houston. 
No one could hit a jumper. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out expecting people to give us something because we  
were the big bad Spurs, And we're not good when we're that way,'' 
Avery Johnson said. ``You stay around San Antonio too much and read 
the papers and believe everything that's being said. But this is no 
sweep. We're in a dogfight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio also committed 20 turnovers and failed to outrebound  
the Knicks for the third straight game. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was only one game and one loss.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a new series at all, to be honest with  
you,'' David Robinson said. ``We expected them to fight back. If 
you go through a series thinking you're going to sweep everybody, 
you're fools. And we didn't think that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it was a great opportunity for us to get a hold of  
the series and kind of get a break,'' Robinson said. ``But we 
didn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Elliott: ``They went out and they wanted it more.''  
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said he would stick with Marcus  
Camby as his starting center in Game 4. He also said it was 
uncertain whether Chris Childs will be able to play with a sprained 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the regular season it would be the type of injury that  
would keep him out 7-10 days,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy also praised Houston and Sprewell for finding so many  
quality shots among their 46 combined attempts. The Knicks also got 
a boost from Larry Johnson, with 16 points and tough defense on 
Duncan that helped keep him scoreless in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks' success in relying so much on Houston and Sprewell  
for offense has exposed the mismatch they can exploit against the 
Spurs' guards, especially reserves Jackson, Antonio Daniels and 
Steve Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not as strong of an advantage as San Antonio has in the low  
post, but at least the Knicks have something they can rely on as 
they try to move the momentum of the series their way in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not out of control and it's not in control,'' Duncan  
said. ``It's right there where it can swing either way. We've lost 
a game, but we're not in a hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel bad about the loss. We're not crying about the  
loss. We're going to go out there the next game and get back to 
what we've been doing.''

<HEADLINE> Stephen King Undergoes More Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Stephen King will need months of physical  
therapy to regain the ability to walk normally after he was struck 
by a van while strolling down a country road over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	King, who underwent more than seven hours of surgery on his  
injured leg and hip late Monday night, faces ``major 
rehabilitation'' over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But his office took care to note that his injuries were from the  
shoulders down. ``Mr. King's mental state is great -- the accident 
has not affected him mentally,'' his office said in a statement 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-selling horror writer remained in serious but stable  
condition today at Central Maine Medical Center, where he will 
likely remain for two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing bad to report. Things are going very well  
indeed,'' said Dr. Larry Hopperstead, director of trauma surgery at 
the hospital in Lewiston. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 51, underwent trauma surgery Saturday night and orthopedic  
surgery Monday. Additional surgery has been scheduled for 
Wednesday, Hopperstead said. 
</P>
<P>
	King was thrown 14 feet when he was hit from behind Saturday  
afternoon by a minivan as he walked along the shoulder of Route 5 
in rural Lovell, where he owns a summer home. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford County Sheriff's deputy Matt Baker, who responded to the  
accident, said King was carrying a book, although he didn't know if 
King was reading it when he was struck. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, Bryan Smith, 41, lost control after being distracted  
by his Rottweiler, which was loose inside the van. Smith was not 
speeding and stopped immediately, Baker said. Smith does not face 
any charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to charge him with,'' Baker said. ``He wasn't  
being reckless, he was just distracted. If he had been drinking or 
something like that, it would have been something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker didn't know of any state law requiring pets to be secured  
inside moving vehicles. However, he noted that King was technically 
violating the law by walking in the same direction as traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to multiple fractures of his right leg, King  
suffered a broken hip, a collapsed lung and a scalp laceration. 
King's office said his recovery after he leaves the hospital ``will 
require major rehabilitation over the next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hopperstead said King, who is taking medication for the pain,  
will be able to walk with assistance in a few weeks, and estimated 
it will be about nine months before he can walk normally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. King is very stable considering the extent of his  
injuries,'' said Maria Ikossi, a surgeon. ``He's a remarkable man. 
He has a sense of humor and asks appropriate questions. He is not 
frantic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, who lives in Bangor, has written more than two dozen  
novels, including ``Cujo,'' ``Misery'' and ``The Dark Half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital has been deluged with calls and e-mail messages  
from King's fans all over the world, wishing him a speedy recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. King, get well soon. This is scarier than any of your  
books,'' wrote Maarten Reumer of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Many messages to King Web sites were rife with references to his  
books. Several jokingly gave thanks that King was not found by 
Annie Wilkes, the anti-heroine in ``Misery'' who finds, kidnaps and 
tortures her favorite author after he goes off a Colorado mountain 
road in his car during a blizzard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't have nightmares about Anne Wilkes . . . she's only in  
your imagination ... I think,'' wrote Abby Hart of England.

<HEADLINE> NBC Plans 2000 Olympics Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ready for some handball? How about fencing,  
table tennis and badminton? 
</P>
<P>
	When NBC turns on its cameras Down Under for the 2000 Olympics,  
the focus will be on the ``traditional theme'' of big sports, big 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	But because of the network's cable branches, in-depth coverage  
will extend to virtually all sports, even the ones that have been 
snubbed before. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cable really opens up what has not been shown in the  
past,'' NBC Sports president Dick Ebersol told the U.S. Olympic 
Committee's executive committee on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes women's soccer and softball, both all but bypassed  
at the 1996 Atlanta Games despite gold medals for the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Also available for anyone with basic cable -- boxing. A staple of  
television's pioneer days, the sweet science has been an Olympic 
no-show lately because of slumping audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been very, very difficult to put on,'' Ebersol said.  
``We found that a quarter of our audience was driven away as soon 
as we went to boxing. But it will be seen every day on CNBC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC plans 330 hours -- double previous levels -- of Olympic  
programming on its three outlets -- 160 hours on the main network, 
170 on the two cable channels. Ebersol said more than half the 
network programming would be in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC, a news and information channel, will carry the Olympics  
from 10 a.m.-5 p.m. EDT, with CNBC, a financial news programmer, 
taking over after the markets close. 
</P>
<P>
	The main network will again focus on track, gymnastics,  
basketball, swimming and other major sports, with the cable outlets 
carrying the more unfamiliar events. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said NBC will again try to tell a story rather than just  
turn cameras on the action. That practice, while drawing big 
ratings and big profits, has been criticized as narrow, but Ebersol 
said it is necessary when most of the sports are not mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to do it strategically and set up the story,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans for Sydney are not a repeat of TripleCast, NBC's  
innovative but money-losing attempt to give pay-per-view access to 
all sports at the 1992 Barcelona Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the added outlets, Ebersol said four or five of  
the 28 sports will be seen only in wrapup highlights. He did not 
identify those sports. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC has paid $3.6 billion for U.S. Olympic TV rights through  
2008 and is the biggest commercial partner of the International 
Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol, an unabashed fan and scholar of the games, has defended  
the committee during the 7-month-old corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a briefing for the USOC, he called the members of the main  
IOC reform commissions -- appointed in the wake of the Salt Lake 
bribery allegations -- ``unbelievably impressive'' and ``a wonderful 
group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the USOC briefing, Ebersol addressed the IOC's surprise  
choice last week of Turin, Italy, as host city for the 2006 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It follows the IOC's recent preference for venues with more  
size, accommodations and transportation links,'' he said in an 
interview. ``It also is consistent with its desire to acknowledge 
countries that have bid unsuccessfully in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rome lost to Athens, Greece, in a battle for the 2004 Summer  
Games, and other Italian cities have come up short in recent 
Olympic selections. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as NBC was concerned, Ebersol said, just about any city  
with a cold climate can be a Winter Games wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
	``So long as they put it someplace with snow and tall mountains,  
we'll make it look like `The Sound of Music,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC executive committee also agreed to a $75,000-a-year  
independent office to make sure staff members, volunteers and 
Olympic bid cities abide by ethics rules. The plan was part of 
recommendations from an investigation headed by former Senate 
Majority Leader George Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	In another matter, the USOC heard that the IOC had placed a  
three-year limit on reviewing results from the games that might 
have been tainted by drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, USOC president Bill Hybl told IOC vice president  
Anita DeFrantz that he wanted to press demands that the 1976 U.S. 
women's 400-meter medley relay be awarded duplicate gold medals 
after finishing second an East German squad since fund to have 
benefited from illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	And other executive committee members expressed dismay that the  
IOC would place limits on retroactive drug sanctions if new 
evidence came to light. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the biggest deterrent to an athlete using drugs is the  
fear of reprisal 10, 12, 15 years down the road,'' said Bill 
Stapleton, the head of the USOC's athletes advisory council. ``What 
is the IOC's rationale?''

<HEADLINE>  Russians Remember Nazi Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russians marked the 58th anniversary of the Nazi  
invasion of the Soviet Union today, holding candlelight vigils and 
visiting graves to remember the millions who perished. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin laid  
a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Moscow. Yeltsin 
later talked with veterans of the war, which began for the Soviet 
Union with a Nazi attack on June 22, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	The Soviet Union suffered by far the greatest losses of any  
country in World War II -- an estimated 27 million soldiers and 
civilians. Russia and other former Soviet republics take enormous 
pride in their role in defeating Nazism. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Russians -- particularly its war veterans -- are bitter about  
their country's loss of world superpower status since the Soviet 
collapse in 1991. They often blame Yeltsin for Russia's diminished 
influence in world affairs and the ruinous state of its military 
and economy. 
</P>
<P>
	During his meeting with veterans, Yeltsin praised Russia's role  
in mediating an end to the NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin told the veterans that Western leaders, who met at a  
summit of the Group of Eight leading industrial nations plus Russia 
last week in Cologne, Germany, admitted ``the Kosovo deadlock could 
not have been broken without Russia,'' according to the ITAR-Tass 
news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Russians across the country held marches and vigils to  
mark the anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	In St. Petersburg, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan laid  
flowers at a monument in Piskaryovskoye cemetery, where many of the 
city's war victims are buried. 
</P>
<P>
	Historians say nearly 1 million of the city's 3 million  
residents died of hunger and cold when Nazi forces kept St. 
Petersburg -- then called Leningrad -- under siege for 900 days.

<HEADLINE> Can Customers Trust Organic Label? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- Consumers will pay more for food they  
believe to be free of pesticides and grown in an a way that 
protects the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	But can they trust it?  
</P>
<P>
	The growth of organic food from a fringe movement to a $5  
billion nationwide industry is based mostly on trust. 
</P>
<P>
	When a label says ``grown and processed in accordance with the  
California Organic Foods Act of 1990,'' it does not necessarily 
mean the food is truly organic, according to the organic foods 
industry, farmers, inspectors and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the food also has been independently certified, they say,  
it's likely no one has checked to ensure the food meets minimum 
state standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The savvy customer knows that if it isn't certified, it isn't  
organic,'' said Route 1 Farms owner Jonathan Steinberg, who grows 
$1 million of mixed vegetables a year on 120 rented acres in Santa 
Cruz County and has been certified since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	To sell something as organic, growers have to register with the  
state and pay an annual fee -- from $25 for under $10,000 in sales 
to $2,000 for $5 million or more. Sellers of processed foods pay 
just $100 for an entire line of products. 
</P>
<P>
	They also have to keep extensive paperwork showing the food is  
free from pesticides and synthetic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	But until recently, the California Department of Food and  
Agriculture hasn't done much more than look into complaints, which 
have been rare. And the Department of Health Services, which 
inspects processed food, has yet to set up an organic compliance 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you register with the state there are basically no  
on-site inspections. They come out and say 'yup, you're organic,' 
end of story,'' said vegetable grower Dick Peixoto of Watsonville. 
``Most customers want that assurance that you're actually being 
monitored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal organic law -- more than a decade in the planning --  
will require certification as early as this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, most major supermarkets have acted on their own.  
About 85 percent of the fruits and vegetables sold by California's 
2500 registered organic growers, packers and shippers is now 
certified. 
</P>
<P>
	But most national retailers -- including such natural food chains  
as Whole Foods Market -- still don't require certification for 
processed food. 
</P>
<P>
	With the industry growing by 20 percent a year, the state  
agriculture department's budget has grown to $350,000 -- enough for 
500 inspections this year, and for the first time, random, 
unannounced soil and tissue samplings, program director Ray Green 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the industry remains small enough for organic violators  
to be easily discovered, and by all accounts, fraud rarely occurs. 
When it does, Green avoids fines or criminal charges, unless the 
fraud seems intentional. 
</P>
<P>
	One such incident involved San Diego-based Petrou Foods Inc.,  
which was caught selling olive oil as organic when some of the 
olives were actually harvested from a golf course. That 
investigation resulted in a felony conviction and $10,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone's doing something that's not right, the whole  
industry learns about it. And believe me, that can be more 
detrimental than anything else,'' said Margaret Wittenberg, an 
executive at Whole Foods.

<HEADLINE> McCain Pushes Tax Relief Plan in SC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful John  
McCain proposed a $161 billion tax relief plan for middle-class 
families during a campaign visit Tuesday to South Carolina, where 
he was compared to both Ronald Reagan and Jesse Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to defend a system that taxes your salary, your  
investments, your property, your expenses, your marriage and your 
death,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina is considered the gateway to the South with its  
early primary, now set for Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's tax relief announcement followed a visit by Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush on Monday, who also talked about cutting taxes and 
making the tax code more fair. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain supporters acknowledge the decorated Vietnam veteran  
faces a tough battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have some real concerns about everyone kind of piling on to  
the George Bush bandwagon just because the money's there and the 
big names are there,'' said Republican state Rep. James Klauber. 
``Ronald Reagan was certainly the outsider candidate in 1980 and he 
has the same type of conservatism that John McCain has today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who tends to be soft-spoken and somewhat reserved, was  
compared to wrestler-turned-politician Ventura, Minnesota's 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wonders why Jesse Ventura got elected,'' said  
Republican state Rep. Jake Knotts. ``It's very simple. He tells it 
like it is. So does John McCain. You may not like it, but you know 
when you walk away it's the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response to a question, McCain estimated the tax relief plan  
totaled $120 billion. Aides said later that the actual figure was 
$161 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he would eliminate $50 billion in ``corporate  
welfare'' in the tax code, and increase the maximum income level in 
the lowest tax bracket from $25,350 to $35,000 for singles and from 
$42,350 to $70,000 for married couples. He also wants to eliminate 
taxes on gifts, estates and Social Security benefits of working 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said the budget surplus should be used to save Social  
Security and cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration forecasts a surplus of $79.3 billion  
this year and congressional accountants predict $111 billion. The 
1998 surplus was $69 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also pledged to close special interest loopholes, citing  
subsidies for sugar and for McDonalds ``to sell hamburgers 
overseas.'' He did not include tobacco on that list -- South 
Carolina is one of the top producers of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tobacco farmers should not be penalized for the behavior of  
the tobacco companies,'' McCain said.

<HEADLINE> Robert Downey Jr. Sent to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Actor Robert Downey Jr. was slapped in  
handcuffs and led off to jail for at least six weeks Tuesday after 
acknowledging -- again -- that he is still doing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to recover, but I'm still finding that difficult,''  
the 34-year-old Downey told Superior Court Judge Lawrence J. Mira. 
</P>
<P>
	The admission came after a series of arrests, failed  
rehabilitation efforts and second chances for the Oscar-nominated 
``Chaplin'' star. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge could have sentenced Downey to prison for three years  
for violating probation by refusing to take a court-ordered drug 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the judge ordered him jailed pending an Aug. 5 hearing  
to decide what will happen to Downey next. He will be housed in the 
jail's drug rehab unit. The judge also ordered a psychiatric 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something I don't understand about you and your use of  
narcotics,'' Mira said. 
</P>
<P>
	Downey previously acknowledged he has battled drugs for 2 1/2  
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 20-minute hearing, Downey, wearing a dark suit and  
tie, thanked the judge and deputies led him away in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robert Downey Jr. came to court today with his drug counselor  
and admitted he has a continuing drug problem. He asked the court 
for help and guidance,'' his publicist Alan Nierob said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Downey's return to jail comes 18 months after Mira scolded him  
for bingeing on drugs and jailed him for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	During one of his many run-ins with the law, he was stopped by  
police in 1996 for speeding on Pacific Coast Highway, and a 
cocaine, heroin and a pistol were found in his pickup truck. A 
month later, he wandered into a stranger's home and passed out on a 
child's bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Downey's movie credits include ``Less Than Zero,'' ``Natural  
Born Killers,'' ``One Night Stand,'' ``Two Girls and a Guy'' and 
``U.S. Marshals.'' His publicist said he is not working on a movie 
now.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Off 69.97 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower today amid some lingering  
interest rate jitters while technology shares pulled back after 
five winning sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 69.97 at 10,746.01. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators posted modest losses.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 6.31 at 1,342.69, and  
the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was down 8.88 at 
2,621.40 after surging nearly 10 percent over the past five 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	With no new economic data to steer the market, investors  
remained focused on next week's Federal Reserve meeting. Fed 
officials are expected to nudge interest rates higher to slow the 
economy as protection against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow slid 39 points on Monday as the yield on the 30-year  
Treasury bond, a key influence on interest rates, bobbed back over 
6 percent. In early trading today, the yield edged higher again, 
reaching 6.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 90.51 million shares, 
on par with Monday;s lifeless pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 2.17 at 634.77, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was unchanged at 765.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.22 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.44 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.26 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.92 percent.

<HEADLINE> Homelike Settings for Mentally Ill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- States may have to place people with mental  
disabilities in homelike settings if they can fare just as well 
there as in state hospitals, the Supreme Court said today in a 
narrow, middle-of-the-road ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 6-3 vote in a Georgia case, the court said a federal  
anti-bias law, the Americans with Disabilities Act, requires such 
community placement of the mentally disabled whenever appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We confront the question whether the proscription of  
discrimination may require placement of persons with mental 
disabilities in community settings, rather than in institutions,'' 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the court. ``The answer, we hold, 
is a qualified yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said such action ``is in order when the state's treatment  
professionals have determined that community placement is 
appropriate, the transfer from institutional care to a less 
restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual, and 
the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account 
the resources available to the state and the needs of others with 
mental disabilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia dispute had galvanized advocates for the disabled,  
who had urged the justices to disallow ``isolation and segregation 
from the societal mainstream of American life'' as a condition for 
receiving psychiatric help. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, Georgia officials had urged the court to rule  
that states are free to choose between treatment in community 
settings and hospitals when both are deemed appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's ruling gave both sides reasons to both celebrate and  
complain. 
</P>
<P>
	And the decision did not provide the final word in the legal  
battle of two Georgia women who once were among the some 70,000 
mentally disabled people nationwide living in state hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Elaine Wilson and Lois Curtis sued Georgia to get out of a state  
mental hospital in Atlanta. They had been approved for 
community-based care but faced long waiting lists. Now in group 
homes, both women attended the Supreme Court arguments for their 
case in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was in a box that I would never get out of,''  
Ms. Wilson told The Associated Press shortly before her trip to the 
nation's capital. ``I feel like a real person again,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She is mildly retarded and was found to have a borderline  
personality disorder. Ms. Curtis also is mildly retarded and was 
diagnosed as schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
	The court today told a federal appeals court to restudy the  
Georgia case, telling it to undertake ``further consideration of 
the appropriate relief, given the range of facilities the state 
maintains for the care and treatment of persons with diverse mental 
disabilities, and its obligation to administer services with an 
even hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Theoretically, a state could choose to do away with all group  
homes and keep all mentally disabled people in state hospitals, but 
doing so appears to be politically untenable. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the states originally lined up to support Georgia  
in friend-of-the-court briefs but came under political pressure to 
support, instead, the concept of maximizing community placement. By 
the time the case was argued in April, only seven states remained 
in Georgia's corner: Colorado, Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, Tennessee, 
Texas and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous advocacy groups for the mentally disabled, the American  
Psychiatric Association, American Civil Liberties Union and 58 
former state officials with leadership roles in mental health 
treatment submitted friend-of-the-court briefs opposing Georgia's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg took pains today in spelling out various matters the  
court was not deciding. For example, she said ``nothing in the ADA 
or its implementing regulations condones termination of 
institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from 
community settings.''	   She also noted that a state's responsibility, ``once it provides 
community-based treatment to qualified persons with disabilities, 
is not boundless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulations say a state does not have to provide  
community settings for all eligible persons if it can show that 
providing them would fundamentally alter its services to the 
mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg said that regulation means states might be off the hook  
if they show ``in the allocation of available resources, immediate 
relief for plaintiffs would be inequitable, given the 
responsibility the state has undertaken for the care and treatment 
of a large and diverse population of persons with mental 
disabilties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter  
and Stephen G. Breyer joined Ginsburg's opinion, in whole or in 
part. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote separately and concurred in 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Clarence Thomas  
and Antonin Scalia dissented. Writing for the three, Thomas said 
the state should be exonerated. ``Temporary exclusion from 
community placement does not amount to 'discrimination' in the 
traditional sense of the word,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New Trade Center Bomb Trial Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four men imprisoned in the World Trade Center  
bombing are not entitled to a new trial because they had competent 
lawyers and were convicted by overwhelming evidence, the trial 
judge has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammad Salameh, Nidal Ayyad, Mahmoud Abouhalima and Ahmad Ajaj  
-- all serving life terms for on conspiracy convictions -- were 
hoping for a new trial in which they could offer new evidence of 
their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy, in a 165-page ruling  
released Monday, dismissed each of the dozens of arguments offered 
by lawyers for the men. Duffy said there was no new evidence and 
their lawyers did well against impossible odds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced that the defendants received an extraordinarily  
fair trial and were convicted on the basis of overwhelming evidence 
of their guilt,'' Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-month trial in 1994 resulted in the conviction of all  
four men on conspiracy charges in the Feb. 26, 1993, attack that 
killed six people and injured more than 1,000 others. 
</P>
<P>
	The terrorist attack was meant to force the United States to  
curb its support for Israel and to stay out of the Middle East. 
Instead, it resulted in a heightening of security at public 
buildings across the country and increased attention given to the 
threat of terrorism throughout the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
	All four defendants were sent to prison for life by Duffy, who  
later presided over a second trial that resulted in the conviction 
of the bombing's mastermind, Ramzi Yousef, and another accomplice, 
Eyad Ismoil. Those two men also received life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Duffy throughout his written analysis of the actions of the  
lawyers for the first four defendants praised them as diligent, 
vigorous, zealous, reasonable and impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the closing arguments of Atiq Ahmed on behalf of  
Ayyad failed to win an acquittal for his client but was not 
ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	``Attorney Ahmed's summation was, after all, part of the overall  
argument which kept the jury in this case deliberating for six 
days, even in the face of overwhelming proof of guilt,'' Duffy 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the evidence offered as new was information related to the  
FBI scandal over its Washington laboratory procedures and whether 
those problems affected the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Duffy noted that Frederic Whitehurst, a former supervisor at the  
laboratory who lodged hundreds of complaints about its operation, 
was questioned for a full day by lawyers in the Trade Center case 
but was rejected as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge was especially harsh in his criticism of the claims  
raised by Maranda E. Fritz, who represents Ajaj on appeal. During a 
February hearing, she questioned the skill of Ajaj's trial lawyer, 
Austin Campriella. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that the accusations of incompetence are totally  
unfounded,'' Duffy wrote, calling Campriella's work in particular 
``clearly outstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Ms. Fritz's ``claims of newly discovered evidence are  
based on scraps of information that would have been either 
cumulative, irrelevant, inadmissible or immaterial at trial and 
could not have, either in whole or part, led to Ajaj's acquittal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fritz did not immediately return a telephone message for  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Ready For Expansion Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Goaltenders Grant Fuhr of St. Louis, Mike Vernon  
of San Jose and Ron Tugnutt of Ottawa were among the players made 
available Tuesday for the expansion draft that will be used to 
stock the Atlanta Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's quite possible that none of them will wind up with the  
NHL's newest team, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers will select 26 players Friday -- one from each NHL  
club except the Nashville Predators, who just completed their 
inaugural season and will not be subjected to losing a player in 
the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Atlanta traded for Damian Rhodes, who teamed with  
Tugnutt to give the Senators one of the top goaltending duos in the 
league. Ottawa received future considerations that may involve an 
agreement to stay away from Tugnutt, who had a 22-10-8 record and 
1.79 goals against average. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta can take up to five goalies in the expansion draft.  
General manager Don Waddell said he would likely take the maximum, 
using the extra goalies as trade bait for needed players at other 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues protected goalie Roman Turek, acquired this week in a  
trade with the Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars. St. Louis left 
Fuhr (16-11-8, 2.44) exposed, knowing the Thrashers would likely 
pass on the 36-year-old because of his age and hefty contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be true for the 36-year-old Vernon, who was  
16-22-10 with a 2.27 goals against for the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, the Thrashers will have trouble finding any scoring  
in the expansion draft. Only six available players had more than 20 
goals this season -- Carolina's Ray Sheppard (25), Detroit's Wendel 
Clark (32), Edmonton's Rem Murray (21), Ottawa's Andreas Johansson 
(21), San Jose's Joe Murphy (25) and Toronto's Derek King (24). 
</P>
<P>
	There is plenty of muscle. Enforcers Stu Grimson of Anaheim (158  
penalty minutes), Rob Ray of Buffalo (261), Bob Probert of Chicago 
(206), Jeff Odgers of Colorado (259), Craig Berube of Philadelphia 
(194) and Tie Domi of Toronto (198) were left unprotected by their 
teams.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Gregg Popovich had plenty to say about the  
officiating during the game. He had very little to add afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Charging the court in a tirade, the San Antonio Spurs' coach  
went ballistic when a 3-pointer by Sean Elliott was waved off in 
the first quarter of the New York Knicks' 89-81 victory. He was, 
shall we say, much more subtle after Game 3 of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Popovich on Tim Duncan only shooting four free  
throws: ``They just made it very difficult for him to get anything 
done down there. That was evident in the fact that he only shot 
four free throws with all those touches. So they must have done 
something right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Popovich's eyes in the first quarter, the refs were doing  
nothing right. 
</P>
<P>
	He went particularly batty when Ronnie Nunn waved off Elliott's  
3-pointer with 2:48 left in the first. Nunn did so because the 
other two refs, Dick Bavetta and Hue Hollins, had called Kurt 
Thomas for a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	Turns out Nunn was right, because the foul was called before  
Elliott let go of the ball. Popovich didn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just saw Sean's shot was basically simultaneous,'' Popovich  
said. ``It was gone before the call was made. But you're always 
prejudiced when you're going for one team or the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I don't know if it was good or not, I have no clue. At the  
time it looked like it was good. I didn't curse at anybody. I just 
told them it wasn't a wonderful call. He didn't like it, gave me a 
`T.' That's what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in the series that the Knicks shot more  
free throws than the Spurs. In Games 1 and 2, the Spurs had a 66-31 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight, we tried to keep our composure and be cool about it,  
but we did pick up a couple of technicals,'' said Spurs center 
David Robinson, who got double-personals and double-technicals with 
New York's Marcus Camby early in the third. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LJ's DELIVERS:* Larry Johnson did his talking on the court in  
Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	With a bum knee and a lighter wallet, Johnson scored 16 points  
and helped hold Tim Duncan to 20 -- including a scoreless fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	It was even more impressive because Johnson is still hurting  
with a sprained knee that requires a diverse diet of painkillers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's hurting very badly,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said.  
``And I think he just made a commitment to put the ball on the 
floor and drive it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Knicks guard Chris Childs: ``L.J. takes pride in his  
defense. He's able to get under Duncan's legs and meet him higher 
by the free throw line and make him work a little harder, push him 
further away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Johnson devoted his efforts to pushing reporters away  
-- and he and the Knicks paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and the Knicks were fined $25,000 each Sunday after  
Johnson unleashed a profanity-laced tirade. It was directed toward 
an NBA official and reporters who were trying to interview him 
during a mandatory media session. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our players and teams are going to comply with our rules, and  
if they don't they will be dealt with accordingly,'' commissioner 
David Stern said Monday at his annual NBA Finals news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that there are individual pressures at times, and  
we are not mindless in our enforcement. We know that there are 
pressures on coaches and players and that the very event that we 
have here intensifies those pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy speculated -- tongue-in-cheek -- before the game that  
pain medication was to blame for Johnson's outburst. Johnson is 
playing with a sprained knee that was injured in the Eastern 
Conference finals against Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's taking a lot of pain medication just to get out there,''  
Van Gundy said. ``I think you either have to ask him about it 
before the pain medication or after, I'm not sure which.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time this postseason Johnson and the team were  
fined. The league fined them $10,000 each on June 8 because Johnson 
twice failed to make himself available to the media following 
practices on June 4 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ALL BUSINESS:* The Spurs' locker room was barren before the  
game. At one point when Tim Duncan and David Robinson came in, they 
were approached and asked one question. Both said they don't talk 
before games. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DUNCAN FOR MVP?:* Some believe that Spurs center Tim Duncan  
would have won the MVP award instead of Utah's Karl Malone if 
voters had waited until the regular season ended to send in their 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we should consider getting them in your hands later,''  
commissioner David Stern said. ``But I think we feel as though we 
are dealing with adults and they have a pretty good idea based upon 
a full season what they want to do.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Ratings Fall 25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While Game 3 had the highest ratings of this  
year's NBA Finals, it dropped 25 percent from last year's broadcast 
on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Knicks' surprising victory over the San Antonio  
Spurs in Game 3 Monday night had a 12.1 rating and a 21 share, down 
from the 16.2 rating and 28 share for Game 3 of last year's series 
between the Chicago Bulls and the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-game average is a 11.1/20, down 35 percent from last  
season's 17.0/30, the highest three-game average in NBA history. 
It's also 7 percent lower than the first three games in 1994 -- when 
Michael Jordan wasn't involved in the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 1 this year got an 11.6 rating and Game 2 got a 9.6, the  
lowest prime-time rating for the NBA Finals since 1978, except for 
the night O.J. Simpson's freeway chase distracted viewers during 
Game 5 of the Knicks-Rockets series in 1994. That game earned a 8.0 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. 
The share is the percentage tuned to a program among televisions in 
use at the time.

<HEADLINE> Republican State AGs Form New Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican state attorney generals are  
organizing a national association to seek political gains and 
advocate restraint in an era of high-profile lawsuits against 
tobacco companies and gun makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting under the umbrella of the Republican National Committee,  
the new group will seek to promote limited government, governmental 
restraint and more effective crime fighting, officials said on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Charles Condon, the attorney general of South  
Carolina and chairman of the new Republican Attorneys General 
Association, said the group will promote those ideas while seeking 
to elect more Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Condon said there is an apparent consensus among  
Republican attorneys generals to contest only open seats and not to 
run against Democratic incumbents. He called that an effort to 
preserve ``collegiality'' among attorney generals and cooperation 
across party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Dupuy, the association's executive director, said  
Republicans are likely to target vacant attorney general seats in 
Nevada and North Carolina in the 2000 elections and will look at 
possible races in other states if vacancies occur. 
</P>
<P>
	At present, Republicans hold the attorney general's post in 12  
of the 43 states that use elections to fill that job. In contrast, 
the GOP now holds 31 of the nation's 50 governorships. 
</P>
<P>
	The new association held its first fund-raiser at a Washington  
club Monday evening. Dupuy said it raised $60,000 from about 60 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Condon said he personally took issue with actions by Democratic  
attorney generals in many states who have sued tobacco companies, 
gun manufacturers and the makers of lead-based paint. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I believe these are matters that should be left to  
the state legislatures,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican attorney generals ``believe in limited government ...  
not legislating through the courts,'' Condon said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges Help for Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Venturing as close to the Kosovo border  
as security would allow, President Clinton thanked Macedonians 
today for supporting NATO forces and sheltering Kosovo refugees. He 
pledged millions of dollars to help build a better future in the 
Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO could not have achieved its mission without you,'' he  
said, addressing Macedonian leaders at their parliament. ``The 
people of Kosovo would not be going home to security and autonomy 
without you. I came here as much as anything else to say thank 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was also making a personal plea to the war-scarred  
refugees he was meeting in the muddy tent encampments less than 10 
miles from the Kosovo border: reconciliation and rebuilding -- not 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced the disbursement of $12 million in food  
commodities to assist Macedonia, in addition to $72 million in 
relief that the United States has sent to the nation since last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States and its European allies were committed  
to investing in Macedonia and its neighbors ``in order to build a 
future of freedom and prosperity'' in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, Clinton noted an executive from the Liz Claiborne  
company was accompanying U.S. officials and that the clothing firm 
intended to open a facility in Macedonia that would employ more 
than 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must create real opportunities for ordinary citizens  
throughout Southeastern Europe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia, an impoverished state of 2 million residents, housed  
up to 140,000 refugees as NATO airstrikes sought to drive the 
forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Macedonians also provided space for NATO to launch its  
peacekeeping mission once the 78-day air war ended just two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief meeting with Clinton, Macedonian President Kiro  
Gligorov said he accepted ``the essential need for the presence of 
the United States of America in Southeastern Europe. The war in 
Bosnia and now in Kosovo have confirmed this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Clinton held another meeting with Gligorov, Albanian  
President Rexhep Meidani and the prime ministers of both countries. 
They discussed the need to diffuse the region's long-held ethnic 
tensions, and Meidani pledged to urge ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to 
``build a spirit of tolerance,'' according to a senior 
administration official who briefed reporters afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Meidani invited Clinton to visit Albania and Clinton expressed a  
desire to do so, but the administration official, citing security 
and logistics concerns, said there were no short-term plans to make 
the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was making his first trip to the front lines of the  
battle he and his NATO allies won against what he called the 
``murderous rule'' of Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving at Skopje's airport, the military personnel aboard Air  
Force One donned bulletproof vests, and Apache helicopter gunships 
escorted the presidential motorcade. 
</P>
<P>
	Reminders of the region's long, volatile history surrounded  
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	After a ceremonial handshake with Gligorov, who bears the deep  
facial scars of a would-be assassin's bullet to his head, Clinton 
was asked by a reporter about Monday's blast in Kosovo that killed 
four people, including two Nepalese peacekeepers with the British 
army. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he telephoned his concern to British Prime Minister  
Tony Blair hours after the deaths on Monday. ``This is dangerous 
work,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is wrapping up a weeklong trip that won commitment from  
the European Union to help in the costly reconstruction of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must build a Europe with no front-line states, a Europe  
undivided, democratic and at peace for the first time in history,'' 
he declared in Slovenia, before going to Skopje. 
</P>
<P>
	For some 10,000 remaining refugees at camp Stenkovec I outside  
Skopje, news reports since the Serb retreat from Kosovo -- NATO 
troops finding burned-out homes, mass graves and witnesses to 
systematic rape and slaughter -- are intensely personal heartbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The president says he wants Kosovo's ethnic Albanians not to let  
that heartbreak turn to anger and revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't, in the end, satisfy anyone. It will only compound  
the horror,'' Clinton said Monday, when asked about reports of 
retaliatory violence by the Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA, which has moved back into Kosovo alongside NATO  
peacekeepers, signed an agreement this week to surrender its 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia and Albania are to be included in the longer-term  
stability package of aid to Southeastern Europe agreed upon by the 
world's industrial powers at their weekend summit in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	En route back to Washington, Clinton and his family stop in  
Aviano, Italy, to greet U.S. forces who took part in the NATO 
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Facing Cabinet Obstacles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Crippling divisions among legislators in  
the ruling party have blocked the formation of a regionally- and 
ethnically-diverse Cabinet, a spokesman for Nigeria's new president 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Olusegun Obasanjo's spokesman Doyin Okupe said the  
Senate was stalling on the approval of 49 Cabinet ministers chosen 
from various ethnic groups and regions of Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo was sworn in May 29, succeeding Gen. Abdulsalami  
Abubakar. Before that, the vast West African nation had been 
governed by soldiers for all but 10 years since gaining 
independence in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is over two weeks now and anxiety is brewing within Nigeria  
and abroad regarding the fact that the democratically-elected 
government of Obasanjo has been slow in taking off,'' Okupe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo has tried to end the northern Hausa domination of  
recent military regimes, but only three ministers had been approved 
by the senators, Okupe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadlock reflects resentment within Obasanjo's own ruling  
party, the Peoples Democratic Party, towards the leader's decision 
to dilute northern power, political observers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Obasanjo is a southern Yoruba, the bulk of support for  
the PDP which controls the Senate is from the north. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria's Constitution requires that the Senate finish screening  
ministers within 21 working days, or by the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The country, which has more than 200 tribes, has long been riven  
by ethnic divisions that have on occasion flared into fierce 
fighting.

<HEADLINE> Hazelwood Starts Serving Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Joseph Hazelwood, infamous for his role  
in the nation's largest oil spill, is now in the cleanup business. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood, ex-skipper of the oil tanker Exxon Valdez, this week  
started serving his sentence of community service for a 1990 
conviction for illegally spilling oil in Alaska's pristine Prince 
William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent Monday loading up a truck with abandoned auto parts and  
assorted junk thrown along the roadsides of Anchorage. He worked 
with one other man and a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	The work was the beginning of his month in Alaska doing litter  
patrol and other cleanup tasks as punishment for the March 1989 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be doing different things each day,'' said Fred  
Fulgencio, who heads Anchorage's community work service program. 
``Tomorrow he could be cleaning parks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first of five summers Hazelwood will spend laboring  
in Alaska. His sentence calls for 1,000 hours of community work, 
broken out as 200 hours, the equivalent of 25 eight-hour days, each 
year through 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	An Anchorage jury found Hazelwood guilty of negligently  
discharging oil in the sound in March 1989, when the Exxon Valdez 
drove up onto a charted reef. 
</P>
<P>
	The grounding dumped an estimated 11 million gallons of oil into  
the sound, coating 1,000 miles of shoreline and killing tens of 
thousands of birds and marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood was acquitted of several misdemeanors, including  
operating a tanker while drunk, and one felony count of 
second-degree criminal mischief. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge who sentenced Hazelwood said his community service  
should include scrubbing rocks oiled by the Exxon Valdez, but beach 
cleanup efforts wrapped up years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence had remained on hold during more than eight years  
of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Hazelwood, who lives in New York, was  
unavailable for comment. The office that handles community service 
sentences refused to say where he was staying. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulgencio said he spoke to Hazelwood before work started, and  
his demeanor was nothing memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normal -- just like the others,'' he said. ``He just wants to  
come in and get it over with.''

<HEADLINE> Old Trieste Scratched From Gold Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Old Trieste, the probable favorite for  
Sunday's $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup, was scratched Tuesday after 
developing a fever. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Mike Puype discovered the 4-year-old son of A.P. Indy  
had a temperature of 103 degrees during an afternoon visit to his 
barn. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked miserable, very uncomfortable,'' Puype said. ``I  
just know this horse too well, so we took his temperature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Old Trieste's scheduled workout Tuesday morning was canceled  
because jockey Chris McCarron was unavailable. The horse was due to 
work out Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Trieste led all the way in winning the $300,000 Californian  
by seven lengths over Budroyale last month at Hollywood Park. It 
was his first race in nearly nine months after being sidelined 
because of a deep abscess in his left front foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's devastating to me,'' Puype said of the latest setback.  
``He loves this track, but we'll have to wait for the next one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gold Cup is sponsored by Sempra Energy.

<HEADLINE> Two Horses Die in Fire at Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELMONT, N.Y. (AP) -- Two horses were fatally injured and a third  
burned Tuesday night when a fire broke out in a barn housing 40 
thoroughbred race horses at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Three civilians sustained minor injuries, according to a Nassau  
county fire official. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire started at the Barn 8 annex at approximately 6:20 p.m.,  
several hundred yards from the barns of Hall of Fame trainers D. 
Wayne Lukas and Scotty Schulhofer. More than 2,000 horses are kept 
in 64 barns at the sprawling 430-acre complex, the largest race 
track in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	According to eyewitnesses, including a groom who ran in to save  
several horses, flames shot ``from one end of the barn to the 
other'' on the ceiling above the stalls, activating the sprinkler 
system. Dozens of track workers converged on the scene, and led the 
rest of the horses to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was extinguished completely by 7:10 p.m., according to  
NYRA officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost two and one was seriously hurt and a few others were  
probably affected as well by smoke inhalation,'' NYRA fire marshal 
Kenny Kopp said. ``But it could have been worse. Much worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dead and injured horses were all trained by Jimmy Toner. The  
horses euthanized by veterinarian Dr. Stephen Selway were Graceful 
Finish, an unraced 2-year-old daughter of Dixieland Band owned by 
John and Joan Phillips, and Clear to Launch, a 3-year-old gelding 
owned by Caesar Kimmel. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured horse, Surely Handsome, a 3-year-old co-owned by  
Kimmel and Ron Nicholson, was returned to another barn after being 
treated by Selway. The horse was later reported by Toner to be 
``resting comfortably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first major fire at Belmont Park in more than 13  
years. In 1986, 45 thoroughbreds died in a fire at Barn 48, 36 of 
them trained by John Campo Sr., who trained 1981 Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness winner Pleasant Colony. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of Tuesday night's blaze was under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	``To speculate how it happened would be an injustice,'' Kopp  
said as he stood outside the front gate of Belmont Park. ``We don't 
know. It could have been a cigarette or something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoking is prohibited inside the stables.  
</P>
<P>
	``The origin of the fire is not known at this time,'' NYRA  
president and COO Terry Meyocks said. ``This is a terrible tragedy, 
but we are grateful the sprinkler system and fire alarm worked 
perfectly, thus preventing any further loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clear to Launch was to have raced on June 16 at Belmont, but was  
scratched. Surely Handsome last raced June 10 at Belmont, finishing 
sixth in a maiden claiming race. 
</P>
<P>
	The barn, which is a receiving barn for horses not usually  
stabled at the track, had a lot fewer horses in it than normal 
because there is no racing at the track on Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire companies from four nearby towns and the track's own  
emergency service responded to the alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response was very quick and the sprinklers in the barn  
worked,'' Kopp said. ``People from track and those responding from 
outside very slowly took the horses out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronnie Hardin, a groom for trainer Pat Kelly whose horses are in  
the barn next to the one that caught fire, was among the first 
people on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden there was this blaze in J.J.'s barn,'' he  
said, referring to Toner. ``It was in the ceiling of the stalls. It 
shot from one end to the other and the barn was all blackened. When 
I went through I saw a horse lying burnt and didn't go for that one 
but we got one out and the one we got out his face was all burnt. 
We walked him until someone took him from us. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had to go in and get those horses. They're in captivity  
behind that webbing and can't do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 15, 1996, What an Evening, a 3-year-old colt, was killed  
in a Belmont stable fire that he started when he reared and toppled 
a heat lamp which set some hay on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	A month-long investigation never determined a cause for the 1986  
fire although a heat lamp in a stall where hay was piled too high 
was considered a possibility.

<HEADLINE> PageNet Announces New Subsidiary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Paging Network Inc., one of the nation's largest  
paging and wireless messaging service providers, on Tuesday 
announced the creation of a new operating subsidiary focused solely 
on wireless Internet and information services. 
</P>
<P>
	John P. Frazee, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said  
the changes will help PageNet transform its traditional paging 
business into a leading provider of wireless messaging services. He 
said the company also wants to build new businesses in wireless 
commerce and communications. 
</P>
<P>
	PageNet provides wireless messaging and information services to  
about 10 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new subsidiary, VAST Wireless Solutions, will be based in  
Dallas and focus on the emerging market for wireless information 
services, the company said. The company said it will be divided 
into wireless information services, wireless solutions for business 
and wireless Internet gateway services. 
</P>
<P>
	Portrayed as a startup technology company rather than part of  
PageNet, VAST Wireless will begin operating immediately and take 
over some of PageNet's current organization. It plans to partner 
with content providers such as Yahoo!, CNN and ESPN, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark A. Knickrehm, PageNet's executive vice president and chief  
financial officer, was named president and chief operating officer 
of VAST Wireless Solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, PageNet announced several other changes in its top  
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward W. Mullinix Jr., formerly executive vice president of  
operations, was named PageNet's president and chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn A. Bace was elevated to executive vice president, while  
Julian B. Castelli was named senior vice president and chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	PageNet stock closed up 50 cents Tuesday, at $4.18 3/4, on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Stern Defends NBA Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television ratings are down in the finals,  
attendance was lower in the regular season and the quality of play 
is diminished. 
</P>
<P>
	If all those woes were troubling David Stern, it didn't show  
Monday as the NBA commissioner did his best to explain them away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were delighted with the season,'' the commissioner said  
Monday at his annual NBA Finals news conference several hours 
before the start of Game 3 between New York and San Antonio. ``It 
was nice to have a season. We think the fans appreciated both the 
settlement of the collective bargaining negotiations and the fact 
that teams like San Antonio -- the league's smallest market -- have 
an opportunity to continue to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 of the finals drew a 9.6 rating, making it the  
lowest-rated game since Game 5 of the Knicks-Rockets series in 
1994. That game drew an 8.0 rating, with many viewers watching the 
famous O.J. Simpson chase. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's Game 2 between Chicago and Utah drew a 17.7 rating,  
which means the audience shrank 42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not alarming to me,'' Stern said, pointing to the  
possible end of the Michael Jordan era and the end of the Chicago 
Bulls' dynasty as factors that drew extra viewers last season. ``We 
expected a huge, huge dropoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern also announced that a 16-member committee, comprised of  
coaches, former players, team executives and owners, would meet 
today to discuss rules changes for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 season was marked by a significant drop in scoring,  
with only one team, the Sacramento Kings, averaging 100 points. 
This continued a decade-long trend toward a lower-scoring games. 
</P>
<P>
	One questioner, a journalist from Spain, pointed to San  
Antonio's unappealing 80-67 victory over New York in Game 2 of the 
finals and wondered whether his countrymen should have bothered to 
wake up at 3 a.m. to watch the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Another journalist from Argentina noted decreasing interest in  
the NBA in Latin America and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the basis of one game and relatively low shooting  
percentages, I wouldn't think that game as you know it has come to 
an end,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true, (Game 2) was not the prettiest game that we've ever  
had in the NBA Finals, and it does continue a trend of very 
aggressive defense. It's an issue that obviously is a concern to 
us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The special committee is made up of coaches Lenny Wilkens, Rudy  
Tomjanovich, Rick Pitino, Pat Riley and Mike Krzyzewski, players 
Antonio Davis of Indiana and Steve Smith of Atlanta, broadcasters 
Isiah Thomas, Hubie Brown and Doug Collins, executives Kevin 
McHale, Donnie Walsh, Billy King and Dan Issel and owners Jerry 
Colangelo (Suns) and Gordon Gund (Cavaliers). 
</P>
<P>
	The committee planned to focus on four areas:  
</P>
<P>
	--officiating: how games are called and whether NBA basketball  
has gotten too physical. 
</P>
<P>
	--the lane: creating more open space near the basket.  
</P>
<P>
	--clock rules: having 24 seconds to shoot and 10 seconds to bring  
the ball past midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	--defense: whether to allow zone defenses.  
</P>
<P>
	``The general consensus is that we need to do some correcting  
here,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``Our goal is to try 
to implement whatever recommendations they come up with by the 
start of next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern also said he would like to establish a minimum age for NBA  
players, perhaps 20. Any such limit would have to be agreed upon by 
the players union, as stipulated in the new labor agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no timetable for holding discussions on the age-limit  
issue, and both sides are awaiting word from the NCAA on whether it 
would be feasible to give low-interest loans to likely first-round 
draft picks who would be forced to stay in college if a limit was 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the lockout, Stern said he did not regret losing the  
first three months of the season while the owners and players 
fought over the terms of an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like to see players stay with their teams while at the same  
time having the right to change teams,'' he said. ``That's what we 
think we've achieved here, and that will cause teams to make better 
investments and more investments and make this a very, very 
competitive league. 
</P>
<P>
	``And basically, as a business, that's what we sell. We try to  
create competition so that fans in the various cities, when the 
season begins, will feel that their team has a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would very much do it again.''

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Apologizes to Belgians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Coke said ``sorry'' to Belgium on  
Tuesday but it did not admit its soft drinks made people sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks after children first became ill after drinking its  
products, the Coca-Cola Co. placed full-page ads in major Belgian 
newspapers to apologize and acknowledged that the world's biggest 
soft-drink business has been slow to respond to consumer concerns 
about food safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, the French government announced its health checks on  
canned Coca-Cola products turned up negative, while a new 
investigation was launched in Portugal when granules of carbon were 
found at the bottom of Coke cans. 
</P>
<P>
	``To all the Belgian people, I want to say that I'm personally  
very sorry for any discomfort or inconvenience,'' M. Douglas 
Ivester, the chairman of Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, wrote in the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``To those people who have suffered, especially the children, my  
colleagues and I want to express a very sincere apology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ads came amid criticism of Coca-Cola for being slow to  
respond to consumer concerns about the illnesses that led to bans 
in Belgium and beyond of such well-known brands as Coke, Diet Coke, 
Fanta and Sprite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have spoken with you earlier,'' Ivester admitted.  
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola's stock rebounded 1.7 percent Tuesday on the New York  
Stock Exchange after sinking 1.6 percent last week and falling an 
additional 3 percent Monday. Coke gained $1.06 1/4 Tuesday to close at 
$62.62 1/2 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester's apology was more contrite than a statement issued last  
week as some 200 Belgians reported cases of nausea and stomach 
upsets and authorities pulled Coke's best selling products from 
stores. But he stopped short of explicitly recognizing tainted Coke 
was he cause of the illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strive to make sure that Coca-Cola always stands for good  
feelings and we regret that it instead resulted in feelings of 
illness,'' said the statement published in French and Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's regrets came as the Belgian Health Ministry reviewed its  
ban in the light of new scientific tests. The French government 
announced its health checks on canned Coca-Cola products turned up 
negative, but added it was seeking the opinion of the French Agency 
for Food Safety before deciding whether to lift sales restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	French Health Minister Bernard Kouchner said the decision to  
consult the agency came because of a case involving a woman who 
lost her unborn child in her seventh month of pregnancy after 
drinking one of the products concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	Kouchner told reporters in Paris that 800 cases were brought to  
the attention of experts and none could be linked to a problem with 
the Coca-Cola cans. ``I confirm that all the results of the 
analyses are good,'' said Consumer Affairs Minister Marylise 
Lebranchu. 
</P>
<P>
	France was one of several countries, from Germany to the Ivory  
Coast, that restricted sales of Coke products in the light of the 
Belgian scare. Some 50 million cans of Coca-Cola products were 
withdrawn last Tuesday from the French market. Coke took out 
full-page newspaper adds in other nations on Monday to reassure 
consumers their drinks were safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The company producing Coca-Cola in Portugal on Tuesday recalled  
several thousand cans after consumers found residue in the bottom 
of cans and alerted health officials, who opened an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Traces of carbon used in the Lisbon factory's water filtering  
system became mixed with the drink in up to 3,000 cans, which the 
company has withdrawn, company spokesman Tiago Lima said. 
</P>
<P>
	The carbon particles are harmless and do not alter the taste or  
odor of the drink, according to the production company, Refrige. 
The source of the problem has been traced and corrected, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has acknowledged separate problems at two factories may be  
behind the health scare. Poor quality gas used to put fizz into 
drinks at a plant in the Belgian city of Antwerp caused an ``off 
taste,'' while wood preservative absorbed by the bottom of cans 
produced at Dunkirk, France, had an ``offensive odor,'' the company 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The explanation has failed to convince Belgian authorities, who  
are anxious to appear tough on food health risks in the midst of a 
separate scandal over meat, eggs and dairy products contaminated by 
cancer-causing dioxin that has alarmed consumers around Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche has repeatedly refused to  
lift the ban on Coke's best-selling brands, although some drinks 
including Nestea, Bonaqua and Minute Maid fruit juices were allowed 
back on to the Belgian market last week.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Seeks Encryption Ruling Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department announced Monday that  
is wants a federal appeals court to reconsider a ruling that 
loosens export controls on encryption technology. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court ruling is allowed to stand, it will have serious  
consequences for the U.S. government's ability to keep encryption 
technology from falling into the hands of ``potentially hostile 
foreign parties,'' the Justice Department said in its petition. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco,  
upholding a lower-court ruling, said in a 2-1 decision last month 
that encryption codes contain expressions of ideas and cannot be 
suppressed indefinitely by government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration limits exports of the most powerful  
encryption technology because it fears law enforcement agencies 
won't be able to read the messages of criminals or terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high-tech industry wants relaxed restrictions so it can  
take full advantage of the booming market for encryption programs 
as Internet commerce increases.

	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Actor Tim Robbins has donated the  
uniform he wore in the baseball movie ``Bull Durham'' to the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The uniform from the 1988 film was donated by Robbins on a  
recent visit with his son, Miles, museum officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbins said the gift ``would allow visitors to have a  
first-hand remembrance of that great baseball movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Bull Durham,'' Robbins played rookie pitcher Ebby Calvin  
``Nuke'' LaLoosh, whose wild throws were tamed by a veteran catcher 
played by Kevin Costner and by a team confidant played by Susan 
Sarandon. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbins' uniform will join a permanent exhibit of baseball film  
memorabilia. It includes Geena Davis' uniform from ``A League of 
Their Own,'' Ray Liotta's jersey from ``Field of Dreams,'' and 
Robert Redford's uniform and jacket from ``The Natural.''
