Elian's Father Said Angry for Delay
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A senior Cuban official Friday said Elian Gonzalez's father is
''frustrated'' and ''angry'' by the pace of efforts to reclaim his 6-year-old
son, two and a half months after the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
said he should be reunited with him. The INS has twice moved back deadlines to
revoke the relative's temporary custody pending more negotiations. In Miami,
Elian's relatives Friday said they would let Gonzalez visit him at their Little
Havana home, but that they are no longer willing to give Elian to his father.
They said they would not resist if the government tried to take Elian from their
house.

Japanese Volcano Erupts Twice
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- A volcano in northern Japan erupted twice on Saturday, a
day after it roared to life and sent a spectacular plume of molten rock and ash
billowing two miles above the crater and rolling down the snow-quilted slopes.
Mount Usu ejected smoke and brightened the sky before dawn Saturday, and erupted
again a few hours later. Experts said the blasts appeared to be less powerful
than Friday's. On Friday, ash dusted silent, evacuated villages near the volcano
following its first eruption in 22 years.

   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- With little more than his eyes and nose visible over the
witness stand, a 6-year-old boy Friday denied that he shot classmate Kayla
Rolland to death and blamed another first-grader. The boy testified at a
preliminary hearing for Jamelle James, 19, who is accused of carelessly storing
the semiautomatic handgun that the 6-year-old allegedly found and used to kill
Kayla on Feb. 29. James is charged with involuntary manslaughter; the 6-year-old
isn't charged.

Tensions Rise Over Zimbabwe Farms
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Civic groups and opposition parties were warned by
police Friday to call off a scheduled peace march as tensions worsened here over
black war veterans' occupation of white-owned farmland. The unrest began in
February, when veterans armed with spears, axes, clubs and guns smashed their
way into white farmers' homesteads and seized their spreads. President Robert
Mugabe has called the occupation a justifiable political protest against the
descendants of white settlers who ruled here during the colonial era. Police
have refused to evict the squatters.

Farmers Shy Away From Biotech Crops
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers are turning away from genetically engineered
crops, especially a biotech corn that's toxic to insects, amid consumer
resistance that started overseas and is now being felt in the United States.
Plantings of the gene-altered corn are projected to drop 24 percent this year,
according to findings of an Agriculture Department survey released Friday. The
biotech corn became especially controversial last year after a Cornell
University study suggested it could be killing Monarch butterflies.

Income, Spending Both Rose in Feb.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American consumers, the driving force behind the
supercharged economy, spent with abandon in February at a pace more than double
their income growth. It dragged the personal savings rate to a record low.
Economists said Friday's report shows that the Federal Reserve has not finished
raising interest rates to slow the economy and keep inflation from becoming a

<HEADLINE> Environmental groups praise DEC policy changes  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state's revised policy on official motor
vehicle access to restricted areas of the Adirondacks and Catskills
is drawing praise from environmental groups who had previously
threatened to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've told our legal team to take a rest for a while,'' said
John Sheehan of the Adirondack Council.
</P>
<P>
   The groups had filed a lawsuit in federal court in January,
claiming the Department of Environmental Conservation improperly
issued motorized vehicle permits to non-departmental users and did
not comply with the state plan governing use of administrative
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Adirondack Council in the suit were the Association
for the Protection of the Adirondacks, Environmental Advocates and
the Residents' Committee to Protect the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit and the groups had planned
to appeal the decision as well as pursue litigation in state
courts, Sheehan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But those plans were put on hold after the DEC announced that it
had made some policy revisions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A DEC spokeswoman said the policy changes were ''relatively
minor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We essentially just clarified the language in the policy to
reflect the language that's included in the state land master
plan,'' Jennifer Meicht said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the revised policy requires DEC employees to file
plans and routine reports regarding their use of motorized vehicles
in the forest preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials, who are allowed to use motorized
vehicles in these areas only in cases of fire and other
emergencies, would be exempt from some of the guidelines due to the
nature of their work, Meicht said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, language allowing the DEC to issue temporary
permits allowing other parties to use motor vehicles in forest
preserves was taken out from the policy. But ''that doesn't change
the fact that we still have the authority to issue temporary
permits ... That's allowed under the state land master plan,''
Meicht said.
</P>
<P>
   One area where motor vehicles have allegedly been misused is the
Santononi Preserve in the Adirondacks. The groups also say the DEC
improperly bulldozed a wide trail for snowmobilers through the
Vanderwhacker Mountain Wild Forest tract, also in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   Still unresolved is the process that DEC goes through to decide
whom to issue these permits. Meicht said the DEC is reviewing that
process.

<HEADLINE> Report: Septic system, not cow manure, may have caused outbreak  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The E. coli outbreak at a county fair last
summer could have been caused by a septic system, not cow manure
seeping in to wellwater, a state Health Department study said.
</P>
<P>
   But neither source of the outbreak could be ruled out, health
officials concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Samples from Well 6 at the Washington County Fairgrounds in
Greenwich had tested positive for O157:H7, the strain of E. coli
that sickened hundreds and claimed the life of two people -- a
3-year-old girl and a 79-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report released Friday, investigators found
that water flowed between the septic system of a dormitory and Well
6, which supplied unchlorinated water to the southwestern parts of
the fairgrounds. Strains of the toxic bacteria were found in the
dormitory of the septic system, about 36 feet from the well.
</P>
<P>
   No water-flow connection was established between the manure
storage area and the contaminated well. But officials added ''it
may never been known if manure-contaminated water percolated from
the manure storage area to Well 6'' because manure was removed
daily and the exact environmental condition at the fair could not
be reproduced.
</P>
<P>
   A long period of drought followed by heavy rain during the fair
had led officials to suspect that runoff from the manure led to
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The manure storage area was located about 80 feet from the well.
No E. coli O157:H7 strain was isolated from manure samples from the
Youth Cattle Barn, 50 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   The single-story dormitory building was operated by Cornell
Cooperative Extension and housed 80 children and their chaperones
during the fair. Twenty Boy Scouts camped next to the building and
also used dormitory facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The source of E. coli found in the septic system could not be
determined, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   During the outbreak, the Health Department had reported that
suspected E. coli infection cases were expected to rise above
1,000. But the department's final count in the study had the number
at 781. Of those, 127 cases were confirmed. Seventy-one people were
hospitalized, 14 of them developing hemolytic uremic syndrome, a
severe complication that could lead to kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of those sickened by possible E. coli
contamination attended the fair, 35 miles north of Albany, during
its last weekend on Aug. 28-29 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Following the outbreak, state Health Commissioner Dr. Antonia
Novello issued emergency orders prohibiting the use of untreated
water at seven agricultural fairgrounds: Chenango County
Agriculture Society; Genesee County Agricultural Society, Inc.;
Madison County Agricultural Society; Washington County Fair, Inc.;
Wyoming County Fair Association, Inc.; Cooperative Extension
Association of Orleans County; and Tioga County Fair have been told
to assess their water supply systems and disinfect their water
through chlorination or other means.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that a
tragedy of this nature never happens again, and that New Yorkers
can count on a clean, safe water supply,'' Novello said.

<HEADLINE> Art meets technology in electronic poetry  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- It is poetry that cannot occur on paper --
the blending of the most modern technology and an age-old literary
form.
</P>
<P>
   It is electronic poetry, and there is no turning back now.
</P>
<P>
   Creating works that evolve and ''perform'' on the computer
screen, there are electronic poets around the world, said Loss
Pequeno Glazier, director of the University at Buffalo's Electronic
Poetry Center, which displays the work of dozens of e-poets.
</P>
<P>
   The center's Web site, he said, logs 8 million visitors a year
from 90 countries. In honor of ''National Poetry Month,'' it will
include a collection of new digital works for and about April.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic poetry has movement or programming qualities that
allow for forms of experimentation that wouldn't even occur to the
writer of print poetry, Glazier said. Poems may move, talk, change
and interact with the reader.
</P>
<P>
   In Roberto Gilli's ''War,'' for example, changing text is
superimposed over black and white images that flash onto the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kac's ''Uirapuru'' extends the myth of a magical
Amazonian bird and sings to the reader. The work incorporates the
writer's personal mythology into the realm of the rainforest and
transforms the bird into a telerobotic flying fish that can be
manipulated by the reader.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic poetry was the logical extension of the ''concrete
poetry'' that became popular over the last several decades, where
poets would arrange letters and words in certain shapes, lending a
visual dimension to the work, Glazier said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once people were working with computers, they said how could
we do something on the computer with poetry that can't be done on
paper,'' he said. ''It was at that moment that electronic poetry
was born.''
</P>
<P>
   There is kinetic poetry, poetry that moves, and programmable
poetries, where a computer program actually helps create the poem.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the Web, you can have the poems move or have some sort of
timing to them or changeability,'' Glazier said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only shapes, but colors, fonts and motion are important
elements of electronic poetry. That means e-poets must be computer
savvy as well as have vision, though there are programs to help
fledgling artists along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Although the poems cannot be bound in a book and put on a
library shelf for the benefit of generations to come, they can be
electronically archived and displayed on Web sites like the
Electronic Poetry Center, which was formed in 1994. As technology
changes and threatens to render the current programs obsolete,
Glazier said the center will do its best to translate poems into
more up-to-date formats so they will be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a challenge,'' he acknowledged.

<HEADLINE> More blacks betting on Quick Draw and facing gambling problems  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A state senator is calling on the state
Lottery Division to stop offering Quick Draw after a new study
indicated more poor blacks and Hispanics are playing the game and
being classified as problem gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This report appears to confirm our worst fears,'' Queens
Republican Frank Padavan said. ''As we suspected when first
proposed -- and we called it 'video crack' -- Quick Draw produces
greater numbers of problem gamblers than other gambling
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The study released Friday also showed that more weekly players
of the rapid-fire game offered in bars, restaurants, bowling alleys
and other gathering places are problem or pathological gamblers
compared with those who play other Lottery games each week, 11.5
percent vs. 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the study showed there was no significant increase in
the percentage of problem or pathological gamblers playing Quick
Draw weekly between 1996 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited study was prepared for the state Office of
Mental Health by Rachel Volberg of Northampton, Mass., a veteran
researcher of gambling problems. It was a study OMH took charge of
after critics derided a 1999 attempt by the state Lottery Division
to evaluate the compulsive gambling threat of Quick Draw. The
critics pointed out that the study was conducted by a consulting
firm selected by the division's ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Volberg study shows that the Lottery Division has been
''targeting low-income minority neighborhoods in the hope of
hooking problem gamblers and that it has been succeeding,'' Padavan
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Volberg said the increase in problem or compulsive gambling
among minorities playing Quick Draw weekly was of ''particular
concern.'' She found that about 25 percent of the blacks and 15
percent of the Hispanics studied in 1999 could be classified as
problem or compulsive gamblers, compared with 8 percent of the
whites playing Quick Draw weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It concluded what we already knew,'' said Laura Letson, head
of the New York Council for Problem Gambling. ''Quick Draw is not a
problem for a majority, however there is still a percentage of the
population experiencing difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the state runs the game, it also needs to set aside
funding for helping problem gamblers at a greater level than is
presently spent, she added. Letson also called for lengthier study
of Quick Draw.
</P>
<P>
   Padavan also criticized OMH for making the report public on a
Friday afternoon -- traditionally state government's favorite time
for releasing information that agencies want buried. In addition,
Friday was the first day since Sunday that the state Legislature
did not meet in Albany, Padavan pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at the Lottery Division said officials there
hadn't seen the report and she declined to comment on it.
Spokeswoman Sue Miller also would not comment on Padavan's charges
that the Lottery Division is targeting poor and minority players
with the Quick Draw game or that the state should discontinue
offering it.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the study's findings were:
</P>
<P>
   --Proportionately fewer whites are playing Quick Draw each week
than in 1996, down from about 90 percent to 68 percent in 1999,
while the proportions of blacks (from 2 percent in 1996 to 16
percent in 1999) and Hispanics (6 percent in 1996 to nearly 14
percent in 1999) were significantly higher.
</P>
<P>
   --Weekly players earning $25,000 or less a year increased from 26
percent in 1996 to more than 29 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   --There were significantly more non-white females playing Quick
Draw each week in 1999 -- 29 percent of all female players -- than
the 3.6 percent non-white females who were playing the game in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   --A review of 1999 client records at three of the six problem
gambling treatment centers in the state indicated that Quick Draw
''does play a role as a trigger for relapse for some problem
gamblers.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Letson, head of the New York Council for Problem Gambling
was on an airplane Friday when the report was released and not
available for comment, her office said.

<HEADLINE> Oneidas ask court to block county foreclosure  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- For the second time in a month, the Oneida
Indian Nation has gone to court to block foreclosure proceedings
started by a local municipality upset over the tribe's refusal to
pay property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe on Friday filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court to
stop Madison County from foreclosing on more than a dozen tribal
properties for overdue taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Nation sued the City of Sherrill to stop it from
evicting the Oneidas from their T-shirt printing factory because of
$2,928 in delinquent taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't charge property taxes on Indian land and these are
Indian lands,'' said Mark Emery, a spokesman for the Oneida Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Madison County Treasurer Harold Landers gave the nation until
Friday to pay $121,079 in back taxes on 13 parcels totaling roughly
316 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The properties included one of the Oneida's SavOn gas stations
near the New York Thruway, the office of Indian Country Today, a
national Native American newspaper; and a 122-acre farm. Combined,
the properties have an assessed value of $1.163 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I'm concerned, I'm the delinquent tax officer for
the county and the taxes have applied to them,'' Lander said.
''I'll follow the real property tax laws through. They should
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The county would go to state court to take title of the
properties and then auction them off in September along with other
foreclosed lands.
</P>
<P>
   The nation lost all but 32 acres of its reservation land in
Madison and Oneida counties to New York state in a series of
transactions in the 18th and 19th centuries and filed a lawsuit in
1974 to reclaim the land. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of
the Oneidas, who are negotiating with the state and two counties
over damages.
</P>
<P>
   While the case remains unsettled, the Oneidas have used their
casino profits to repurchase more than 12,000 acres inside the
boundaries of the land claim. How much land will become untaxed
Indian land is a key issue for county leaders concerned about the
lost revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit, the Oneidas contend that the land in question
is reservation land protected by the U.S. Constitution, the 1794
Treaty of Canandaigua and the Indian Trade and Non-Intercourse of
1790.
</P>
<P>
   ''By trying to auction off Indian land, they are breaking
federal law,'' Emery said. ''They are breaking the same federal law
that the land claims are based on. They can't acquire or sell
Indian land without the approval of the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas argue they do not have to pay taxes on reservation
land and that any land they reacquire in the land claim area
automatically reverts to reservation land, positions they say that
are upheld by past federal court decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Emery said state courts do not have jurisdiction
over Indian issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indian affairs are a federal issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Landers noted that the Wisconsin band of Oneidas paid back taxes
on a property in Lenox, although it was under protest.
</P>
<P>
   Emery countered that the New York Oneidas have given more than
$1 million in grants to school districts in which they own land.
Oneida County has received more than $300,000 from the same
program. It is the only municipal government to accept the grants
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Oneida County officials have said they will not foreclose on
nation-owned property while the negotiations are continuing.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Pataki leads rivals for possible governor's race  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki continues to lead two
potential Democratic rivals for the 2002 governor's race, a
statewide poll has reported.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee Miringoff, head of Marist College's Institute for Public
Opinion, said Friday the new poll ''points to a competitive
re-election campaign'' for Pataki if he decides to seek a third
term.
</P>
<P>
   The Marist poll had Pataki at 50 percent and federal Housing
Secretary Andrew Cuomo at 40 percent in one possible matchup. It
had Pataki leading state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, 52 percent to
33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of McCall have said the comptroller, the only black
thus far elected to statewide office in New York, has told them
privately that he will run for governor. Publicly, McCall has said
he will announce his plans after this November's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, the son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, who Pataki drove from
office in 1994, has said he is considering the race.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Pataki, who said during his 1994 campaign for
governor that he would serve only two terms if elected, has since
said he is considering running for a third term in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's lead over the younger Cuomo is statistically unchanged
from a September poll from Marist. McCall has closed the gap
against Pataki a bit. In September, Pataki led McCall, 54 percent
to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Marist poll did not ask Democrats who they would vote for in
a possible primary between Cuomo and McCall.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting finding in the poll was that Sen. Charles
Schumer's approval rating has slipped to 39 percent, down from 44
percent in September. But Miringoff noted that Schumer's
disapproval rating has also fallen, from 39 percent in September to
34 percent in the new poll.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, said the pollster, is the victim of being pushed out of
the limelight in New York because of the Senate race between
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''It reflects what happens when Hillary and Rudy decide to do
their thing in your state,'' Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's job approval rating is at 51 percent in the
latest poll, statistically unchanged from September's poll, but
down from the 61 percent approval rating the governor enjoyed one
year ago in the Marist poll.
</P>
<P>
   One good sign for Pataki, according to Miringoff, is that 60
percent of voters surveyed feel the state is headed in the right
direction while only 29 percent say it is headed in the wrong
direction. A year ago, 64 percent of voters felt New York was
headed in the right direction while 26 percent felt it was going
the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear the people of New York support the governor's
policies and his leadership,'' Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll by the Poughkeepsie-based pollsters of 561
registered voters was conducted Monday and Tuesday and has a margin
of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Xerox to eliminate 5,200 jobs, take $625 million charge  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- In a move that had been anticipated for
months, Xerox Corp. has announced plans to cut 5.5 percent of the
company's worldwide workforce.
</P>
<P>
   The business machines giant, struggling to compete in both the
large and small office markets, announced Friday it would slash
5,200 jobs, close manufacturing plants and take a $625 million
charge against earnings in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox said the cutbacks will help the company focus on its two
core markets: business machines such as copiers for home and
medium-sized offices, and larger systems that enable big companies
to organize and share information in the form of digital documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''While these are difficult actions for our people, Xerox can no
longer operate business as usual and expect to win,'' said Rick
Thoman, the Xerox president and chief executive. ''We're
intensifying our drive to become a faster, leaner and more flexible
enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoman said the marketplace has changed from the days when the
company was a leader in photocopying technology.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were praised by analysts, who said Xerox needs to make
the cuts to compete with Hewlett-Packard and Canon. But Xerox stock
dropped 2 percent Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, falling
56\ cents to close at $26 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are going to try their best to compete in any way
possible, not just by cutting but also by announcing new
products,'' said Marjorie Saint-Aime, an analyst with brokerage
firm Pittsburg Institutional Inc. ''They are going in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Runkle, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said
the company is making the right moves, but may need to go further.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the key here is that the company needs to recreate an
infrastructure that is more efficient, lower-cost and (one) that
generates higher returns, which goes far beyond just taking out
some general and administrative costs,'' Runkle said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Friday was the company's fourth major
restructuring in the last decade. In 1998, the company took a $1.1
billion charge and cut about 9,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox said none of the cuts in the latest overhaul will affect
its sales force or research and development efforts. The company's
struggle to realign its sales force along industry lines rather
than geographical boundaries has been blamed in part for its
disappointing performance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company's profits fell 52 percent in the fourth quarter,
with revenue down 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said it expects to see another decline in
earnings in the first quarter, which ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The $625 million charge includes about $175 million for closing
facilities and scrapping some of the company's inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox spokesman Jeff Simek said some manufacturing plants will
be closed, along with some warehouse and distribution facilities.
Simek would not say where plants will be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox said the job cuts would affect all work levels and
geographic areas, with more than half coming from offices in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts will hit especially hard at Rochester, N.Y., the
company's manufacturing hub. Xerox said about 2,000 out of 14,650
jobs in the Rochester region will be eliminated. The company's
cross-town rival, Eastman Kodak Co., has eliminated 6,300 jobs in
Rochester over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts will hit especially hard at Rochester, N.Y., the

jobs in the Rochester region will be eliminated. The company's
cross-town rival, Eastman Kodak Co., has eliminated 6,300 jobs in
Rochester over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The news is sobering, to say the least,'' said Rochester Mayor
William Johnson Jr., adding that he was hopeful the regional
economy would once again bounce back from deep job cuts by big
employers like Xerox and Kodak as it has done on-and-off since the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a strong economy, a diverse economic base,'' he
said. ''But I've always said that at some time we're going to reach
the saturation point.''
</P>
<P>
   Simek said jobs will be eliminated across the board, but the
hardest-hit ranks will be U.S. upper- and middle-management, which
will be cut by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the company's headquarters were reluctant to talk
about the job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, who would not give her name, said the cutbacks would
be good for the company in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know we're going to have some cuts, but it's very important
for us (as a company),'' she said. ''I know we're going to do
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Xerox, traditionally a high-end copier company, in the last few
years has made a move to become a major player in the home office
and small business environment, through low-end retail channels
such as Staples and Office Max.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the company announced it would buy the color
printing division of Tektronix Inc. for $950 million in a deal that
will make Xerox second only to Hewlett-Packard in the office color
printing market.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox also announced a $2 billion alliance with Sharp and Fuji
Xerox to develop and manufacture inkjet products for small and home
offices.

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb aiming to snap up Wesley Jessen shares  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc. is setting its sights
on Wesley Jessen VisionCare Inc.'s outstanding shares in a bid to
gain control of the cosmetic contact-lens company.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to negotiate a buyout last month, Bausch &AMP; Lomb
said Friday it will commence a tender offer Monday for all
outstanding shares of Des Plaines, Ill.-based Wesley Jessen at a
price of $34 a share in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed purchase price amounts to a 37 percent premium over
Wesley Jessen's stock price on March 22, when Bausch &AMP; Lomb made an
unsolicited offer to buy the cosmetic color lens maker for $600
million.
</P>
<P>
   ''By my calculations, Wesley Jensen is worth more than $34 --
it's probably between $40 and $45 a share,'' said Judson Brooks, a
research analyst at Ariel Capital Management in Chicago, which is
Wesley Jessen's largest institutional investor with a 14 percent
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with Bausch &AMP; Lomb had been under way for a few
weeks when Wesley Jessen, preferring to take its own expansionist
route, announced March 20 it had agreed to buy Ocular Sciences
Inc., a rival contact lens maker in South San Francisco, for $413
million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Surprised by the move, Bausch &AMP; Lomb said it had no interest in
acquiring Ocular Sciences and moved instead to take its offer
directly to Wesley Jessen shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Once its tender offer is complete, a process that could take
weeks or even months, the company said it intends to acquire any
shares not purchased in the tender offer for the same cash price.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb's chief executive, William Carpenter, said he
would still prefer to negotiate ''a mutually acceptable transaction
in which Wesley Jessen management would become part of our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Wesley Jessen rejected Bausch &AMP; Lomb's takeover
offer as inadequate and said it remained committed to its pending
merger with Ocular Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Jessen controls about two-thirds of the highly profitable
cosmetic color-lens market. It had $311.7 million in sales last
year while Bausch &AMP; Lomb, which has strength in premium disposable
lenses, had contact-lens revenues of $475 million.
</P>
<P>
   If Bausch &AMP; Lomb grabs control of Wesley Jessen, it would come
within distance of market leader Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which had about
$900 million in contact-lens revenues in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Arrests at Black College Reunion  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Police made more than 60 arrests,
most for minor infractions such as drug possession or disorderly
conduct, as thousands of young men and women descended on this
beach community for Black College Reunion this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''The arrests that have been made have been for relatively minor
things,'' Volusia County Sheriff Bob Vogel said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One person was cut with a knife and required stitches, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal officials and local NAACP leaders were
monitoring local businesses for any signs of discrimination against
the guests.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the scrutiny was the Adam's Mark, the area's
largest hotel, which was accused of discriminating against black
guests during last year's reunion. The company recently settled for
$8 million two lawsuits brought by the U.S. Justice Department and
five former guests and promised to revise its policies.
</P>
<P>
   Most noticeably, black hotel guests this year weren't required
to wear orange wristbands as they were last year. Guests, however,
were required to pay in advance in full for their rooms and were
required to leave a $50 deposit to use the telephone and snack bar
in their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark officials said reunion visitors were being treated
the same as guests during other special events, such as Bike Week
and spring break.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing that we are doing at this hotel that is out
of the ordinary or that is in any sense racially motivated,'' said
Fred S. Kummer III, Adam's Mark' vice president of corporate
affairs. Kummer and his father, CEO and president Fred Kummer, flew
down from the company's St. Louis headquarters to personally
supervise the hotel this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephanie Perry, 30, of Lakeland, said the heavy police
presence at the hotel and a written code of conduct passed out to
guests upon check-in were unique to Black College Reunion and she
hadn't seen them other times she was at the hotel. The code of
conduct put out by the city warns against public nudity and
carrying undomesticated animals, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are little differences you notice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Reynolds, a 22-year-old visitor from Miami, said he had to
get a white friend to order registration information over the phone
because hotel clerks wouldn't send him the information when he
called.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they must balance the safety of the guests while
not appearing to target Black College Reunion. The 16-year-old
event is known for clogging beachside traffic and complaints of
lewdness.

<HEADLINE> Two More D.C. Manholes Erupt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two manhole covers flew into the air,
including one near the White House late Friday, the latest in spate
of so-called manhole explosions in the nation's capital over the
past few months.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the incident just outside the White House
grounds, or in another that occurred earlier in the day in the
downtown area of the city.
</P>
<P>
   It's not certain what has been causing the manholes to erupt,
although the local electric power and natural gas utilities have
been blaming each other. Friday's incidents may have been caused by
failed electric cable splices, according to the Potomac Electric
Power Co.(PEPCO).
</P>
<P>
   The incident late Friday just outside the fence at the rear of
the White House grounds was reported by U.S. Secret Service agents,
according to a Fire Department spokesman, who said the metal cover
''flew into the air and smoked up.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been at least a half dozen such manhole explosions
over the past few months in the city. On Feb. 18 three manhole
covers flew open, soaring as high 30 feet into the air, in the
Georgetown business district.
</P>
<P>
   PEPCO in a report blamed the Feb. 13 incidents on workers at the
Washington Gas Co., nicking a power cable. Washington Gas denied
that and said tests showed the cable could not have been
penetrated.
</P>
<P>
   Both the D.C. fire department and the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms have been investigating the incidents.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes 3, Flames 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Greg Adams had two goals and Jeremy
Roenick scored his 12th game-winner of the season as the Phoenix
Coyotes, despite just 12 shots on goal, defeated the Calgary Flames
3-1 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal point in the game came early in the second period
with Phoenix ahead 1-0. Less than a minute after goalie Sean Burke
preserved the lead by stopping Jarome Iginla on a 2-on-1, Roenick
put Phoenix ahead 2-0 after an error by rookie Sergei Varlamov.
</P>
<P>
   Varlamov, playing his second career NHL game, tried to make a
short pass moving out of the Flames end, but it was intercepted by
Roenick, who broke in alone and beat Fred Brathwaite.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick is second in game-winning goals, one behind Pavel Bure
of the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   After Burke lost his shutout bid at 7:33 of the third period on
Sergei Krivokrasov's first goal with Calgary, Adams sealed the
victory with his second goal of the game -- into an empty net with
43 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, out shot 31-12, has won two straight after a seven-game
losing streak. The Coyotes moved into sole possession of sixth
place in the Western Conference, two points ahead of the Edmonton
Oilers. The Coyotes play in Edmonton on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix played again without the captain Keith Tkachuk, out with
a tender right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The loss for Calgary was its fifth straight on home ice. The
Flames are seven points behind San Jose for the eighth and final
playoff spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix opened the scoring at 10:09 of the first period on its
first shot of the game when Adams broke over the Flames blue line
and ripped a slap shot just inside the goal post
</P>
<P>
   With 11 players already injured and out of the Flames lineup,
Calgary lost Jason Wiemer in the second period with a leg injury.

<HEADLINE> Women's Final Four Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Home court was not a factor the first two
times Connecticut and Tennessee met this season, so playing on a
neutral court should make no difference as the teams battle for the
national championship on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is seeking its seventh title and fourth in six years.
Top-ranked Connecticut won its only championship in 1995, defeating
the Lady Vols to cap an undefeated season.
</P>
<P>
   A missed layup at the buzzer against Tennessee cost Connecticut
a shot at another undefeated season as the Huskies fell to the Lady
Vols 72-71 at home on Feb. 2. Connecticut beat Tennessee 74-67 at
Knoxville on Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knowing their personnel is important,'' Tennessee's Kristen
Clement said. ''We've played them twice and we know them pretty
well. It comes down to how well we execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee advanced to the title game with a 64-54 victory over
Rutgers on Friday. Connecticut beat Penn State 89-67 in the
nightcap.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a tight game,'' said Sue Bird, who led UConn
with 19 points against Penn State. ''But if we play a complete
game, we'll have a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   REVAMPED REGIONAL: Those long days of regional competition in
the women's tournament -- and midnight starting times -- might be
ending soon.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA and ESPN, which has the television rights to the
tournament, are looking at playing the regionals over four days
instead of two.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the eight regional semifinals are played on one day.
The first game starts late in the morning and the last one tips off
at midnight EST. The four regional championship games are played on
Monday, starting in the early evening and finishing with another
midnight game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to look at that very carefully because neither you
nor we are satisfied that midnight starts are the best things for
us or the best things for the viewers,'' Len DeLuca, ESPN's senior
vice president for programming, said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   HOME SWEET HOMECOMING: Kristen Clement, a native of nearby
Broomall, hit her first three shots and scored eight of Tennessee's
first 10 points as the Lady Vols advanced to the national
championship with a 64-54 victory over Rutgers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clement made a 3-pointer from the top of the arc and a
long-range jumper and a 3-pointer from the wing as the Lady Vols
took a 10-5 lead 5:59 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Clement did not take another shot until midway through the
second half. She went to the bench after committing her second foul
6:38 into the game and did not play the rest of the first half. She
finished with eight points.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just having fun,'' Clement said. ''Coach told me not to
try and force things, to relax and have fun and that's what I did.
It felt great. I was more concerned with getting my team
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   DIVINE INTERVENTION: A group of nuns sat among the Penn State
fans, cheering every basket by the Lady Lions and cringing each
time Connecticut scored. The sisters came from nearby Immaculata
College to support Penn State coach Rene Portland, who played on
three national championship teams at Immaculata during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Tennessee's Michelle Snow broke a Final Four record
with seven blocked shots. Connecticut's Kara Wolters blocked six
against Tennessee in 1996. ... Shawnetta Stewart, a Philadelphia
native, led Rutgers with 11 points and eight rebounds. She fouled
out with 1:01 left in the game. ... Hillary Howard played in the
national championship game last season as the point guard for Duke,
which lost to Purdue. Howard was back in the Final Four this year,
covering the games as a reporter for an Internet site. ... The
crowd of 20,060 was the largest to attend a college basketball game
in Pennsylvania. The previous high was 19,372 for a Villanova-Notre
Dame men's game in February 1997. . . The NCAA issued 669
credentials for the women's Final Four, most ever in the history of
the tournament, officials said. The number exceeds the amount
issued for the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals and the 1998 U.S. Figure
Skating Championships at the First Union Center.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics 123, Kings 108  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) - Gary Payton had 35 points and 15 assists Friday
as the Seattle SuperSonics ended a five-game homecourt losing
streak with a 123-108 victory over the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics (41-31) moved within half-game of the Kings (41-30)
in the race for seventh spot in the Western Conference standings.
The Sonics scored a season-high 69 points in the first half in
rolling to a 20-point lead. The Kings got no closer than 15 during
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Rashard Lewis came off the bench and added 20 points and eight
rebounds. Vin Baker had 15 points and 14 rebounds before fouling
out. It was Baker's second double-digit rebounding game in the past
28 games.
</P>
<P>
   Predrag Stojakovic led the Kings with 23 points. Chris Webber
had 22 points, 12 rebounds and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics beat the Kings for the first time in three meetings
this season. The teams play for the final time in the regular
season on April 18 in Sacramento -- a game that could decide the
seventh and eight spots.
</P>
<P>
   It was Seattle's first win over a team with a .500 or better
record since they beat Charlotte 84-81 on February 28.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics kept the Kings on their heels with an uptempo game
led by Payton, Horace Grant and Ruben Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Grant's two free throws gave Seattle its biggest lead at 87-63
with 6:58 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's transition game was keyed by their 47-37 rebounding
advantage. The Sonics also had 28 fast break points to 14 for the
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Payton had 22 points and 13 assists in the first half as the
Sonics raced to a 69-49 halftime lead. After being dominated inside
by the New York Knicks on Wednesday, the Sonics outscored the Kings
40-26 in the paint during the opening half and 62-42 overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics may have played their most complete quarter of the
season in the first quarter, racing to a 36-22 lead. Payton led the
Sonics with 13 points and six assists.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Kings placed Jon Barry on the injured list with an
irritated cervical nerve in his neck and activated Bill Wennington,
who had missed the previous five games with a right calf strain.
...Sonics coach Paul Westphal met with Horace Grant, Vin Baker and
Gary Payton behind closed doors before the game. ...Baker had seven
rebounds and a blocked shot in the first half though he did not
score. ...The Kings play nine teams with a .500 or better record
the rest of the season.

<HEADLINE> UConn To Meet Tennessee For Title  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- And now, the matchup that seemed such a
certainty all season long.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting Connecticut-Tennessee, Part III.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's two most visible programs in women's basketball,
the teams ranked 1-2 nationally, will meet Sunday night to decide
the NCAA championship. These are the teams that everyone knows,
both with All-Americans, both with talent that runs deep into the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   And these are the teams that most expected to meet on the final
night of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who follows women's basketball has been waiting for
this game,'' Connecticut's Shea Ralph said. ''Everyone penciled
Tennessee and Connecticut in their bracket. We're ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-ranked Tennessee (33-3) comes in with six national titles
-- four more than anyone else -- and is in the championship game for
the fifth time in six years. Top-ranked Connecticut (35-1) has just
one title, but the Huskies are always in the hunt and no one has a
better record (230-17) over the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Both made it with hard-earned victories in Friday night's
semifinals. Tennessee finally solved Rutgers' baffling matchup zone
in the second half and won 64-54. Connecticut pulled away from Penn
State in the last 13 minutes to win 89-67.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rematch of the 1995 title game, which UConn won 77-66,
and it will be the third time they've met this season. Each won on
the other's floor.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Bird scored 25 points to lead Connecticut to a 74-67 victory
at Tennessee on Jan. 8 as the Huskies proved their mettle before a
crowd of 23,385. Tennessee won 72-71 at Connecticut on Feb. 2,
Semeka Randall scoring the winning basket with 4.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The two have played 10 times in all since starting a
regular-season series in 1995, each winning five. This will be the
fourth time they've met in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knowing their personnel is going to be real important,''
Tennessee guard Kristen Clement said. ''We've played them two times
and we know them pretty well. It's all going to come down to how we
execute.''
</P>
<P>
   That execution will depend in large measure on the point guard
play.
</P>
<P>
   Bird, a sophomore, has been outstanding this season after
sitting out most of last year with a torn knee ligament. The
Huskies often lacked direction in her absence, but she has kept
them on a steady course all season long.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee hasn't lost since coach Pat Summitt moved freshman
Kara Lawson from the wing to point guard after a 27-point loss at
Georgia. The Lady Vols' winning streak now stands at 20.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson led Tennessee with 19 points against Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we call something, I know she's going to make good
decisions for us,'' Summitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Bird also scored 19 points in Connecticut's victory, making
5-of-7 3-pointers. She played 34 minutes and had five assists with
no turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sue Bird hasn't gotten any awards this year,'' UConn coach
Geno Auriemma said. ''She didn't make all-conference. Nobody thinks
she's one of the best point guards in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll tell you what. I wouldn't take any other point guard out
there in America ahead of Sue Bird. She's that good. Without her,
we wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five first-team All-Americans will be in the game:
Ralph and Svetlana Abrosimova for UConn, Tamika Catchings for
Tennessee. Randall was a second-team pick.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a tight game,'' Bird said. ''But if we play a
complete game, we'll have a good shot.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton cost
$52 million, the most expensive independent counsel inquiry ever, according
congressional investigators. The General Accounting Office said Starr's
Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky probe exceeded the $47.4 million record set by
Lawrence E. Walsh in the 1980s for the Iran-contra investigation, The Washington
Post reported Saturday. During the past six years, five independent counsels

''frustrated'' and ''angry'' by the pace of efforts to reclaim his 6-year-old
son, two and a half months after the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
said he should be reunited with him. The INS has twice moved back deadlines to
revoke the relative's temporary custody pending more negotiations. In Miami,
Elian's relatives Friday said they would let Gonzalez visit him at their Little
Havana home, but that they are no longer willing to give Elian to his father.
They said they would not resist if the government tried to take Elian from their

Japanese Volcano Erupts Twice

   DATE, Japan (AP) -- A volcano in northern Japan erupted twice on Saturday, a
day after it roared to life and sent a spectacular plume of molten rock and ash
billowing two miles above the crater and rolling down the snow-quilted slopes.
Mount Usu ejected smoke and brightened the sky before dawn Saturday, and erupted
again a few hours later. Experts said the blasts appeared to be less powerful
than Friday's. On Friday, ash dusted silent, evacuated villages near the volcano
following its first eruption in 22 years.

   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Civic groups and opposition parties were warned by

February, when veterans armed with spears, axes, clubs and guns smashed their

Mugabe has called the occupation a justifiable political protest against the
descendants of white settlers who ruled here during the colonial era. Police
have refused to evict the squatters.

<HEADLINE> Two Dead in NYC Police Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two men were shot to death during a
confrontation with undercover police officers Friday night when at
least one person in their group displayed what appeared to be guns,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred in Brooklyn around 9 p.m. when two
undercover narcotics officers were approached by five men, said
Det. John Giammarino.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men grabbed a gold chain hanging from the neck of one
of the officers, Giammarino said. Some in the group allegedly
displayed weapons, which police later discovered were fake guns
wrapped in black electrical tape to make them look real.
</P>
<P>
   The other three suspects fled and were being sought, Giammarino
said.
</P>
<P>
   A security guard was fatally shot in a scuffle with an
undercover officer outside a Manhattan bar March 16 during a
buy-and-bust operation. Another undercover officer fatally shot an
unarmed man in the Bronx borough two weeks earlier, not far from
where an unarmed African immigrant was shot and killed last year by
four white police officers.

<HEADLINE> Nurses Strike at Mass. Hospital  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- The first strike by registered nurses in
Massachusetts in 14 years came at an awkward time for officials at
St. Vincent Hospital, who long ago had picked today to move into
the hospital's new, $215 million building.
</P>
<P>
   But as angry nurses donned placards and began an
around-the-clock picket outside the new and old facilities Friday,
hospital officials declared the move would still be made.
</P>
<P>
   Officials planned to transfer most hospital units, staff and
patients to the new building, about one mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Contract talks broke down Wednesday and the strike began early
Friday as some workers left work in uniforms to head to the picket
line.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're looking at the numbers, they're looking at the money,
and we're sick of it!'' said Judy Read, a 10-year nurse at the
hospital. Her picket sign said: ''Corporate Greed Is to Blame.''
</P>
<P>
   The nurses, who have been in contract negotiations for over two
years, reached agreement on 3.5 percent annual raises. But they
disagreed over the hospital's insistence to reserve the right to
require overtime when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital managers say the mandatory overtime provision ensures
they can staff the hospital in any contingency. The nurses say
managers are really trying to avoid hiring additional staff that is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital kept operating Friday with 64 non-striking regulars
and 62 replacement nurses. State health regulators, who were
monitoring, said those nurses were caring for 172 patients at the
329-bed hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital had a pre-strike nursing staff of 535. It wasn't
immediately clear how many were striking, but the strike was
authorized by a better than 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's chief executive officer, Robert Maher Jr., has
said managers could hold out in a strike for months and run the
hospital safely.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Supreme Court Justice Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By HOLLY RAMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- An associate justice of the New Hampshire
Supreme Court has resigned after prosecutors concluded he broke the
law by trying to improperly influence the assignment of judges
hearing his divorce case.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general on Friday also said the court's chief
justice broke the law just by listening to Associate Justice
Stephen Thayer, who will not be prosecuted in exchange for stepping
down.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer, 54, tried to influence the selection of substitute
judges when his own divorce case came before the high court,
Attorney General Philip McLaughlin said. The regular justices
disqualified themselves from hearing the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   At a court meeting on Feb. 4, Chief Justice David Brock said he
had appointed two substitutes, including retired Superior Court
Judge George Pappagianis. According to the attorney general's
report, Thayer immediately objected, saying, ''Oh no, don't do
that. Not Pappagianis.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's clerk later said Brock told him to ''slow this
down'' and not tell Pappagianis he had been appointed, but the
clerk already had done so.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said Brock, by listening to Thayer, broke a law that
prohibits judges from hearing privately from anyone involved in a
case. There is no criminal penalty for violating that law, however.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin concluded that Thayer violated two laws: improper
influence, a felony, and official oppression, a misdemeanor.
However, he said Thayer would not be prosecuted in return for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer's lawyer, William Brennan, said Friday his client's
actions were not criminal and that a trial would have led to his
''complete vindication.''

<HEADLINE> Cafe Refers to Seattle Boom  </HEADLINE>
By LUIS CABRERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The name Boomtown Cafe was a natural, Anthony
Anderson says, in this high-tech mecca where millionaires have been
sprouting like mushrooms for the last dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson's eatery, which offers an entree, green salad and
beverage for a mere $1.75, is more interested in catering to those
still busted amid the boom.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is to be able to provide people with a meal that's
nutritious, in a manner that is dignified, instead of having people
stand in line with a tray (in a shelter) and eat food that's
unrecognizable,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, the former manager of Windows on the World atop New
York's World Trade Center, is part of a group of homeless advocates
and food workers who endeavored for five years to raise money and
find a site for the private, nonprofit cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great thing to be able to sit down and be served, and
also to be able to buy a meal for a friend,'' says Bob Kubiniec,
cafe co-founder and associate director of Real Change, the city's
twice-monthly newspaper about the homeless, who also sell copies of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a four-star restaurant'' compared to eating at a
homeless shelter, said patron Brian Hopkins, 33, indicating the
half-dozen or so tables flanked by wall booths, each adorned with a
fresh-cut daffodil.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins came in for the lasagna with garlic bread. Other entree
choices were squash soup or a meatball sub, with a salad and drink.
</P>
<P>
   The salad was crisp and artfully arranged with carrot strips,
cucumber slices and freshly grated Parmesan cheese. The sub came
open-face on a sesame-seed bun, smothered with melted cheese, red
sauce and more Parmesan.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson feels the quality of the food and presentation is
''extremely important.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wippel, spokesman for the nearby Union Gospel Mission, says
his clients have nothing but good things to say about the Boomtown
Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The place is clean, and it's certainly in the right spot,
right in the middle of where all the people who are homeless
reside. I just think it's great,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe is located in downtown Seattle, near a park popular
with the homeless and near several shelters and low-income hotels.
It also sits across the street from the King County Courthouse and
another public building, and some of the skirt-and-blazer crowd
does drop in, Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   Cafe organizers gained operational insight from the pioneering
Sisters of the Road cafe in Portland, Ore., and they took
inspiration from John Steinbeck's ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' reading
it together as they finalized their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Joad family was drawn across the country by these signs
that were put all over saying 'work available,' the streets were
paved with gold. They put all they had in the car and trekked out
to find that was not the case,'' Kubiniec says.
</P>
<P>
   He says the situation is somewhat similar in present-day
Seattle, where Microsoft alone is estimated to have produced as
many as 10,000 new millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's drawing people by creating dreams of wealth that ain't
delivering for everyone,'' Kubiniec says.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers make up much of the cafe staff, often including those
who can't afford the price of a meal but are willing to lend a hand
with dishes, break down boxes or do other chores, Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   Those who won't work, however, won't eat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's difficult,'' he said. ''We want to be compassionate, but
we don't ever want to give someone something for nothing, because
there's not a whole lot of respect in that situation.''

<HEADLINE> Forty Years of Weather Satellites  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In 1900, a hurricane slammed into Galveston,
Texas, without warning, killing as many as 8,000 people. Such
storms can no longer sneak up on major cities, thanks to technology
celebrating its 40th anniversary today.
</P>
<P>
   The first weather satellite took to the sky on April 1, 1960,
sending back a fuzzy gray cloud image that forever changed the way
we look at the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is, the satellite is indeed the primary observing
system in the tropics. I just can't imagine doing our job now
without'' it, said Max Mayfield of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just the simple fact that people can see the hurricane threat
every day on television now'' helps them understand the threat, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Today the blurry first image has been replaced by a stream of
brightly colored images tracking hurricanes, pinpointing twisters
and measuring the power of El Nino and the drift of volcanic ash.
</P>
<P>
   ''What weather satellites represented was putting a sentinel in
a guard tower up above the Earth,'' said Jamison Hawkins, chief of
services at the National Weather Service's Office of Meteorology.
''The atmosphere is a jigsaw puzzle, and without satellites we have
a lot of pieces missing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Weather Bureau, as the weather service was known then,
didn't pick up the Galveston storm until water was lapping over the
docks, Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Four days before the hurricane destroyed Galveston, there had
been reports of a storm in Cuba, but no one believed it could cross
the Gulf of Mexico, he said. ''If we had had a satellite,
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Compare that with Hurricane Andrew, where we drew a bead on
that storm over a week in advance when it was a cluster of
thunderstorms out in the Atlantic ... It caused $30 billion in
damage and only 14 people died,'' Hawkins said. The 14 deaths were
direct storm fatalities in Dade County, Fla. The final toll
including other states was about 40 deaths in the storm, still
remarkably low.
</P>
<P>
   Former National Hurricane Center director Robert Sheets once
said that if he had only one tool to do his forecasting job, it
would be the geostationary weather satellite.
</P>
<P>
   And today's satellites do more than just show cloud tops. They
measure radiation from the ground and air, allowing scientists to
take the temperature below; they can sense water vapor in the air,
indicating where clouds and storms may form and they can even track
plankton in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of deadly tornadoes in Oklahoma last May 3,
satellites showed moisture boundaries, telling forecasters that
conditions were right for powerful storms to form, recalled
Hawkins, who worked at the National Environmental Satellite, Data
and Information Service before joining the Weather Service. NESDIS
operates the nation's weather satellites.
</P>
<P>
   And severe weather isn't the only use for satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Marine and aviation programs also rely on information collected
by weather satellites covering huge expanses of ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see the jet stream, we see the Gulf Stream, we see the
interaction of the ocean and the air,'' Hawkins said. ''In short,
it is a workhorse we find absolutely entwined in every forecast
process we now conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   That first satellite -- Tiros -- quickly revealed the value of
watching weather from on top.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists saw that clouds banded together in strange ways
they had not expected. Patterns emerged that helped them make
better predictions. Even strange upward lightning strokes were
discovered -- a phenomenon long rumored among pilots but never
before recorded scientifically.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 100, 76ers 88  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal had 37 points, 14 rebounds
and eight blocks Friday night as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the
Philadelphia 76ers 100-88 for their eighth consecutive win and 27th
in 28 games.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal also moved ahead of Philadelphia's Allen Iverson in the
NBA scoring race as Iverson was held to 15 points on 6-of-20
shooting. O'Neal is averaging 29.097 to Iverson's 28.918.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles led almost all the way, was up 78-69 to start the
fourth quarter and steadily widened the gap in the final period,
with O'Neal scoring 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper had 16 points for Los Angeles, and Rick Fox had 13
off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Geiger had 20 points and Toni Kukoc 19 for the 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ran the Lakers' record against Eastern Conference
teams to 26-3, with Sunday's game against the New York Knicks their
last against an Eastern Conference opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Geiger outscored O'Neal 14-13 in the first half, but O'Neal had
a 12-3 rebounding edge over the 76ers' center and the Lakers led
51-46.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles opened a 32-23 lead on two free throws by Glen Rice
early in the second quarter, but the 76ers refused to let them pull
away. Kukoc scored six points in the final two minutes of the half
to keep it close.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson was held to 16 points in this season's earlier meeting
between the teams, an 87-84 Lakers' victory. With Bryant guarding
him, Iverson missed all 11 of his shots in the second half of that
game.
</P>
<P>
Notes: If the Lakers beat the Knicks on Sunday, Los Angeles will
finish with the highest winning percentage ever by a Western
Conference team against the East, topping the .868 (33-5) mark by
the 1971-72 Lakers led by Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West. ... The
76ers (42-30) already are assured of their best record since
1990-91, and they have a good shot at bettering that season's mark
of 44-38.

<HEADLINE> Report: Federal Bookkeeping Better  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agencies are doing a better job of
keeping their books but still keep inadequate financial records on
programs worth billions of dollars, a government report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a clear picture of government assets, liabilities and
costs is difficult, Congress' General Accounting Office said,
because of ''significant financial systems weaknesses, problems
with fundamental record keeping and financial reporting, incomplete
documentation and weak internal control.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the GAO said in a report compiled together with the
Treasury Department and the White House Office of Management and
Budget, there has been real progress compared to a decade ago, when
almost no agencies prepared and issued audited financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ''More agencies are completing their financial statements on
time, and the quality of the data continues to improve,'' Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers wrote in the report.
</P>
<P>
   It found that in audits of 24 federal agencies for fiscal year
1999, 13 got clean ratings, up from six, when the first survey was
conducted in 1996, and 12 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Another four agency statements got qualified, or acceptable with
problems, opinions, and five -- down from 13 in 1996 -- came back
with disclaimers, meaning the auditors were unable to determine the
reliability of significant portions of the statements. Two did not
meet the filing deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Management and Budget's Joshua Gotbaum said
another ''significant milestone'' for the year was that the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants recognized
federal accounting standards as ''generally accepted accounting
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., who discussed the report Friday
at a hearing of his House Government Reform Committee panel, said
agencies as a whole still earned no better than a ''D+'' in
providing reliable, accurate financial information.
</P>
<P>
   Horn acknowledged some progress but said he was ''disheartened,
but not surprised,'' that significant accounting discrepancies and
financial weaknesses remain. Horn graded all 24 agencies, giving A
grades only to NASA and the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said the
comprehensive audit, the third in the nation's history, was an
exercise in frustration. ''It is simply unacceptable that any
federal agency,'' he said, ''cannot be held accountable for the way
it spends taxpayer money.''
</P>
<P>
   Horn also asked why trustees of the Medicare and Social Security
trust funds came out with a report on Thursday, just a day before
Treasury's report, that gave a far rosier outlook of the financial
solvency of the two programs.
</P>
<P>
   General Accounting Office Comptroller General David Walker
agreed that the lack of coordination in the two reports ''makes the
government look foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker praised the Social Security Administration for making
good progress in financial management, while singling out the
Pentagon, which holds a large percentage of government assets, for
being unable to consistently produce auditable financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
   The government was ''unable to support significant portions of
the $1.76 trillion reported as the total net cost of government
operations,'' the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   It said $313 billion reported as a liability for remediation of
environmental contamination and disposal of hazardous waste may not
be complete, and data were not available for an accurate estimate
of a reported $196 billion military retirement health benefits
liability.

<HEADLINE> Gore Support May Change Elian Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heartened by Vice President Al Gore's
unexpected support, sponsors of a bill to grant Elian Gonzalez and
his family permanent U.S. residency are hoping for a surge in
support. But don't count on it, a White House spokesman suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy White House press secretary Jake Siewert said support for
the legislation still seems slight, despite Gore's backing.
</P>
<P>
   Was the White House threatening a veto? ''We believe that is
unnecessary,'' given the lack of support, Siewert said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, supporters welcomed Gore's break with the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a bill by Sens. Bob Smith, R-N.H., Bob Graham,
D-Fla., and Connie Mack, R-Fla., to give Elian permanent residency
status in the United States. It was proposed this week as a
compromise after an earlier bill to give the boy U.S. citizenship
languished in both the House and the Senate for lack of support.
</P>
<P>
   The new version also would extend permanent residency status to
Elian's father and five other family members now living in Cuba
should they come to the United States. Residency is a step short of
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said Gore's support ''certainly helps'' the bill. ''There
will be significant Democratic support,'' he said. Gore's support
for the legislation had been evolving for some time and shouldn't
have caught anyone by surprise, the Florida Democrat added.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said he had only
a few hours' notice of Gore's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was surprised. We were notified in advance. But I was
surprised,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he disagrees completely with the vice president. ''What
is best for the child is for him to be reunited with his father as
soon as possible in the most calm environment we can create,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said he didn't know whether Gore's position would
translate into more support for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''The circumstances, I should say, are rapidly changing, and I
don't know at this point whether anybody's done an accurate head
count on what the votes might be,'' he said. ''Anything is
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also apparently didn't tell President Clinton directly.
</P>
<P>
   ''His office spoke to the chief of staff's office, and we let
the president know,'' said Siewert, the White House spokesman. Was
Clinton upset?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the president's angry at all,'' Siewert replied.
''We've said for some time now that the president and the vice
president would occasionally differ on issues, particularly as the
vice president makes his views known as he begins to run for the
presidency himself, and that's to be expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would have the immediate effect of allowing
Elian to stay in the United States while a Miami family court
decides his custody.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department wants to return the boy to his father in
Cuba. Discussions between immigration officials and the boy's Miami
relatives, who want to keep him in Florida, are to resume Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The boy has become the center of an international custody battle
since he was found last November clinging to an inner tube in the
Atlantic after a shipwreck. His mother died in the accident.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Alleges Unfair Trade Barriers  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- From Argentina to Zimbabwe, the Clinton
administration is accusing countries around the globe of erecting
unfair trade barriers that U.S. officials contend are costing
billions of dollars in lost sales for American exporters.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to demonstrate it is acting to lower America's
record trade deficits, the administration on Friday accused 55
trading partners, including major ones such as the European Union
and Japan and tiny ones such as Uzbekistan, of unfair practices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is the creation of an open and fair world economy,
which will support higher-wage jobs in the United States and
enhance prosperity for American workers, farmers and businesses,''
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's allegations were contained in a 434-page
''Foreign Trade Barriers'' report that said American manufacturers,
farmers and service companies were being discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   From the long list of problems cited in the annual report, the
administration will select at the end of April a smaller number of
''priority'' countries for investigations that could lead to filing
of cases with the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vigorous monitoring and enforcement of trade agreements is a
top priority of this administration,'' Barshefsky said. ''Full
implementation is critical to securing the full benefits of trade
agreements for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The country drawing the largest attention, as measured by the
number of pages in the report, was Japan, with 60 pages expressing
disappointment over its slow pace toward eliminating ''unnecessary,
costly and excessive regulations that cover about 40 percent of all
economic activity in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15-nation European Union was second in terms of the number
of complaint pages at 34. China, which has been singled out for
sharp criticism in past reports, took up 17 pages in the 2000
edition.
</P>
<P>
   However, a senior U.S. trade official said that if Congress
approves permanent normal trade relations for China, the
concessions China has promised in exchange for being allowed into
the WTO will solve virtually every problem raised in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity,
denied that the administration softened criticism of China in this
year's report to try to win congressional votes for the China deal.
</P>
<P>
   The EU in recent years has released its own report complaining
about unfair barriers in the United States to trade and investment
from Europe. Last year's report of European complaints about U.S.
trade barriers totaled 62 pages.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the U.S. report covers 52 nations individually and three
trading blocs, the Arab League, cited for its trade boycott of
Israel; the Gulf Cooperation Council and the EU.
</P>
<P>
   Among complaints raised in the report, South Korea was cited for
barriers to the sale of American cars, Mexico for restricting sales
by U.S. telecommunications companies and Canada for barriers to
American farm products.

<HEADLINE> US Sues Over Implant Fund Recovery  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government wants to recover
millions of dollars it spent treating thousands of women allegedly
injured by silicone breast implants, and it's trying to get in line
ahead of the women for its money.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department on Friday sued six companies and a
settlement fund that the companies set up to compensate women
claiming injury by the implants. The lawsuit, filed in Birmingham,
Ala., seeks to recover money spent by Medicare and other federal
health care plans to treat silicone breast implant injuries.
</P>
<P>
   It asked that the money come out of the settlement fund, and it
called on the court to halt settlement payments to those who use
federal health plans until the federal government gets reimbursed
for its costs.
</P>
<P>
   As of last April, 81,000 women had been sent payments from the
settlement fund, which is expected to operate for 15 years. The
Food and Drug Administration banned most use of silicone gel-filled
breast implants in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit did not put an exact figure on how much the
government is seeking, but a Justice Department statement said it
was in the millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Care Recovery Act permits the government to recover
the cost of providing medical care to people injured as a result of
the wrongful acts of a third party, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   The government ''demands payments from the MDL (multi-district
litigation) settlement fund of its reasonable costs or providing to
or paying for hospital, medical, surgical or dental care on behalf
of claimants who were, or will be paid through the MDL settlement
fund and-or the common benefit fund for injuries alleged to be
caused by a breast implant,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice spokesman Charles Miller said the lawsuit took this form
because negotiations to recover the money from the implant
manufacturers had been unsuccessful after several years of talks.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the class action settlement provided women
with $3,000 for surgery to remove the implants and additional
payments for those with diseases or injuries allegedly caused by
the implants.
</P>
<P>
   Of the women who have received payments from the fund, 17,000
got $3,000 for removal surgery, the lawsuit said. An additional
26,000 women also received payment for a breast implant-related
disease and another 10,000 received a one-time $2,500 payment to
waive all future claims.
</P>
<P>
   As of last May, 52,118 implant recipients had refused to join
the class action, preserving their right to press their claims
individually, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   It said the companies and the settlement fund administrator
failed to determine whether any of the women making claims had been
Medicare beneficiaries before sending them payments from the
settlement fund. And it said the defendants had not paid the
government on behalf of any Medicare-treated women who obtained
settlement payments.
</P>
<P>
   The companies named in the lawsuit were Baxter International
Inc., Baxter Healthcare Corp., Bristol-Meyers-Squibb Co., 3M Co.,
Union Carbide Chemical and Plastics Co., and Union Carbide Corp.
Edgar C. Gentile III was named in his capacity as escrow agent of
the settlement fund.

<HEADLINE> Starr Sets Costly Record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional investigators say Kenneth
Starr's investigation of President Clinton cost $52 million, the
most expensive independent counsel inquiry ever.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office said Starr's Whitewater and Monica
Lewinsky probe exceeded the $47.4 million record set by Lawrence E.
Walsh in the 1980s for the Iran-Contra investigation, The
Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
   During the past six years, five independent counsels have spent
a total of $95.3 million investigating the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Since the law was enacted in 1978, 20 independent counsels have
investigated high-level officials. While Congress allowed the
independent counsel law to expire last July, the costs continue to
accumulate.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, the last independent counsel appointed under the
old law, Ralph I. Lancaster, began an investigation of Labor
Secretary Alexis. H. Herman because of charges of influence
peddling. Lancaster's probe has cost more than $3 million, the
congressional investigators said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Business Has Been Good to Bush  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HOLMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The oil business has been good to George W.
Bush, and in 1999 the Texas governor was good to the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   The first major bill Bush signed during Texas' most recent
legislative session was a $45 million tax break for small oil and
natural gas producers. The bill's numerous, bipartisan supporters
said the help was needed to keep small producers pumping under what
then were low crude-oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are tough times for the oil and gas industry, and this
legislation says our state is committed to helping this vital
industry,'' Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee,
said in signing the bill last March.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with oil prices now soaring, Bush has said he is
considering endorsing suspension of a 4.3 cent-per-gallon federal
gasoline tax hike that was approved as part of President Clinton's
1993 economic recovery plan. Congressional Republicans call it the
''Gore tax,'' because the vice president cast the deciding vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Senate already is considering suspension of
the tax increase but has put off action on a rollback bill until
this coming week. But the measure uncertain prospects in the House,
and even proponents admit a rollback would offer modest relief for
motorists at best.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the Clinton administration should be blamed for prices
averaging well over $1.50 per gallon because it squandered the
goodwill built with oil producers by his father, former President
Bush, in the Persian Gulf War and because it lacks an overall
energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Bush said he would urge Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
Mexico to ''open the spigots'' and would remind them of the U.S.
role in the 1991 war and of its economic bailout of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of opponents to the Texas tax-break bill protested
that it provided corporate welfare to oil companies while offering
little long-term relief to the industry. They said other businesses
suffered economic downturns without eliciting similar help.
</P>
<P>
   Noting efforts to hold down spending elsewhere, Bruce Buchanan,
a political scientist at the University of Texas, said of Bush:
''He's got a tender spot for (oilmen) that's not apparent in some
other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Bush began his business career in the West
Texas oil fields, and he has received substantial support from the
industry since entering politics in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of his fund raising by the campaign finance group
Texans for Public Justice found that $5.6 million of the $41
million Bush raised for his two gubernatorial races came from the
energy and natural resources industries.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been friendly to that sector, policy-wise, and they've
been good to him in return,'' said Craig McDonald, director of the
group. ''He rewarded them with tax breaks when they cried that they
weren't making enough money.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing Bush's presidential campaign finance reports, the
Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics ranked oil and gas
eighth among top industries giving to Bush, accounting for $1.42
million thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said there was no
connection between political contributions and Bush's support for
the 1999 tax break.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor supported the legislation to help small,
independent oil producers, oil field workers and Texas families who
depend on the oil and gas sector. (They) were in a desperate
situation last year,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear Bush feels a kinship with those in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation from Yale and the Harvard Business School, Bush
returned to Midland, Texas, where his father had entered the oil
business after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Starting as a landman, who checks deeds and mineral rights, the
younger Bush founded an exploration firm in the 1970s that put
together private partnerships for drilling ventures. He named it
Arbusto, meaning ''bush'' in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   By 1982, Arbusto was on hard times. The company had less than
$50,000 in the bank and was about $420,000 in debt. Bush changed
the name to Bush Exploration Co. and took the business public.
</P>
<P>
   The company later merged, first with Spectrum 7 Energy Corp., a
firm of Cincinnati-based investors, and later with Harken Energy,
an Irving, Texas, corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his partners got $2 million in stock in the latter
merger, and he became a consultant and director of Harken. It was
during this time that Bush's business dealings came under increased
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   One incident involved a potentially lucrative offshore drilling
project awarded by the government of Bahrain in 1990 to Harken,
even though the company had never drilled a well in water.
</P>
<P>
   The news media questioned whether the Middle Eastern country was
trying to curry favor with Bush's father, then the president. The
younger Bush has said he had nothing to do with the Bahrain deal.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Bush sold almost two-thirds of his holdings,
or $840,000 in stock, at $4 a share. A week later the company
announced a major loss, and its stock closed down about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the sale as
possible insider trading but brought no action against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he sold the shares to repay a loan he had taken to
invest in the Texas Rangers baseball team in 1989. That $600,000
investment brought him about $14.9 million when the team was sold
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> The Sheiks Headed for Derby Again  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The sheiks are ready to give the Kentucky Derby
another try.
<TEXT>
<P>
   China Visit, owned by the Godolphin Stable of sheiks Maktoum al
Maktoum and Mohammed al Maktoum, is being pointed toward the Derby
on May 6 at Churchill Downs, racing manager Simon Crisford said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Skeikh Maktoum is very keen to go for the Kentucky Derby with
his home-bred colt, China Visit,'' Crisford, Godolphin's racing
manager, said. ''We are hoping that Chief Seattle will also be able
to take part in the Kentucky Derby and we are now planning their
shipping arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   China Visit, with Richard Hills aboard, won the first United
Arab Emirates Derby on March 25 at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse in
Dubai. In just his second career start, China Visit beat Bachir by
4 1-4 lengths in the 1[-mile race on dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The colt, along with Godolphin-owned Curule -- third in the UAE
Derby -- will be nominated for the Triple Crown races on Saturday at
a cost of $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Seattle, who finished second to Anees in the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile last November, was purchased by Godolphin from William
Betz and Phillip Needham. He has yet to race this year, but may run
in a trial race at Nad Al Sheba to prepare for Derby.
</P>

   Last year was the first time the Makhtoum family sent a horse to
the Derby. Its Worldy Manner finished seventh.

<HEADLINE> N. Carolina Looks To Shield Tobacco  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina, the nation's No. 1
tobacco-producing state, is joining other states trying to shield
the tobacco industry from feared bankruptcy that could occur with a
possible $300 billion verdict in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Already, three states -- Virginia, Kentucky and Georgia -- have
approved laws to cap the bond a company must pay to appeal a damage
award. Under Florida law, the appealing party must post a bond
equal to the amount of damages awarded by the jury to protect the
plaintiff's right to collect.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt has called a special session of the
Legislature for Wednesday to consider a proposed cap on appeal
bonds a state-based company must pay.
</P>
<P>
   Republican state Rep. Rex Baker, representing tobacco factory
workers and farmers in northwestern North Carolina, said the
financial risks to tobacco companies ''are so high, we can't take a
chance of a judge being irrational.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, a former R.J. Reynolds executive, said he fears a $300
billion appeal bond could endanger the $100 million in state taxes
generated by North Carolina's tobacco industry, which produced
449.6 million pounds of tobacco last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the tobacco industry had to post such a bond, there's no
way it could be done,'' Baker said. ''The only way they could
prevent that from happening is to declare bankruptcy. It would be
absolutely devastating. It's the end of tobacco as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Banzhaf, a law professor and director of Action on Smoking
and Health, said the intent of lawsuits isn't to put tobacco
companies out of business. ''That's their scare story ... to
influence legislators to pass legislation designed to protect
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The protection rankles anti-tobacco forces and troubles some
constitutional law scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clearly unconstitutional,'' said Richard Daynard, a
Northeastern University law professor and director of a group that
encourages lawsuits against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   He said it violates the full faith and credit clause of the U.S.
Constitution, which requires states to recognize each other's court
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents like North Carolina's governor and attorney
general say it is an economic necessity in North Carolina. Tobacco
generates nearly $1 billion for North Carolina farmers and 114,000
people are employed in tobacco-related jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia and Georgia approved a $25 million limit; Kentucky set
it at $100 million. North Carolina is considering a $25 million
cap.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, a Democrat, said that the measure is needed not just to
preserve the tobacco industry but to ensure that states continue to
get their annual payments from the $246 billion nationwide
settlement with the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida jury found last year that cigarette companies --
including R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Liggett Group and Lorillard
Tobacco Co., all three of which are based in North Carolina -- made
a deadly product. The jury is now considering how much compensatory
damages to award three representative plaintiffs in the class
action. If it awards compensatory damages, it then will weigh
punitive damages for all of the smokers.

<HEADLINE> Brunei Prince Rudely Awakened  </HEADLINE>
By RANJAN ROY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) -- For generations, every child
in Brunei heard the legend of how a glittering mountain of gold
that stood to feed the kingdom vanished beneath the seas to punish
a wasteful and indifferent people.
</P>
<P>
   Now that tale may be replaced by a real story -- of a prodigal
prince who set forth to conquer the world, buying skyscrapers,
diamonds, yachts and fast jets; a prince who may not live happily
ever after.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, whose family has ruled the sultanate on
the northern tip of Borneo for 600 years, found sometime in 1998
that the cupboards containing the nation's oil riches were bare.
</P>
<P>
   The keys were with his youngest brother, Prince Jefri Bolkiah,
who until then had controlled the finance ministry and as chairman
of the Brunei Investment Agency was responsible for investing the
nation's oil money overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the tiny sultanate surrounded by offshore oil reserves --
its golden mountain -- has been rudely awakened to economic reality
and its people exposed to the depths of royal extravagance.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Jefri and his flagship company Amedeo reportedly
squandered an estimated $16 billion in 10 years. Nobody in Brunei
knows exactly how much money was lost, but it has been large enough
to affect the entire nation at a time when revenues were stretched
by low oil prices and the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The government is prosecuting Jefri for wasting the nation's
wealth. His passport was impounded and he is a virtual prisoner in
his palace on the outskirts of the capital, adjacent to a
Disneyland-like amusement park he created.
</P>
<P>
   Jefri lives on a stipend of $300,000 a month, which his lawyers
say is paltry by the prince's royal standards and given that he has
four wives and 35 children to support.
</P>
<P>
   The government, meanwhile, is trying to get back some of the
squandered wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Brunei's High Court asked Jefri last month to disclose his
assets, which even corporate detectives hired by Brunei in London
have not been able to fully assess.
</P>
<P>
   In an interim ruling in the civil suit filed by the Brunei
Investment Agency against Jefri and 71 others -- including his son --
Chief Justice Denys Roberts said Jefri spent $2.7 billion just on
aircraft, yachts, cars and jewelry. ''This suggests a lifestyle of
great extravagance,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings have so far been closed. But once a trial begins, Jefri
may be forced to appear to defend himself from accusations that he
squandered money in a lavish lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Debris from his once-starry empire dot Bandar Seri Begawan in
the form of half-finished and abandoned office buildings, their
scaffolding still attached. Some of the world's most prestigious
hotels, the Plaza Athenee in Paris, the New York Palace, the
Dorchester Hotel in London and the Bel-Air in Los Angeles, all
believed to be owned by Jefri, may be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed quickly for the prince in the last two
years. The last time he was dragged to a court was when beauty
contestants filed a suit in 1998 alleging they had been brought to
Brunei and held against their will. The royal family denied the
charge and the court accepted Jefri's immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Brunei, with a population of 300,000, is still a rich country.
Its per capita gross domestic product of $20,100 is close to that
of Germany, Japan and Hong Kong -- and no one pays taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Sultan himself is rarely seen in person, only on television,
lit to appear in an Islamic and statesman-like way. He stays in a
palace with his first wife, while the second has a palace of her
own on the outskirts of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows when they flit in and out in their private jets,
but everyone has heard about the designer clothes, the BMWs and
Jaguars and the prize horses in air-conditioned stables.
</P>
<P>
   There is no parliament, no annual budgets are presented, no
balance sheets disclosed. No one is allowed to question the divine
authority of the sultans, and the former British protectorate
exists in a ''state of emergency'' imposed 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody knows how much the palace spends and how much money
Brunei earns from oil,'' said a Western diplomat in Bandar Seri
Begawan. ''We can only guess because the whole thing is shrouded in
secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jefri's case is beginning to change attitudes toward royalty
among younger, Internet-savvy Bruneians who have studied and
traveled overseas.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, newspapers are gleefully discussing Jefri's
allegedly wanton ways, giving residents a glimpse of life behind
the high walls of the palaces. A new Web site is bombarded with
letters asking how Bruneians feel about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Although people on the street still balk at the idea of
discussing the Bolkiahs with foreigners, they are beginning to do
so increasingly among themselves, local journalists said.
</P>
<P>
   But few expect a cascade of changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government is only showing that nobody is above the law,''
said Hatta Bin Zainal Abidin, leader of the Solidarity Nation
Party, an inactive political group that is the closest to a
political party in Brunei. ''It's still a family matter.''

<HEADLINE> Former Cemetery Director Indicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The former director of the historic
Congressional Cemetery has been charged with embezzling more than
$175,000 from dozens of cemetery clients -- including an FBI
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors charged in an indictment that 64-year-old
John Hanley used the money to buy racehorses, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcers said the theft included a $4,545.80 check in
August 1996 intended to help maintain the gravesite of FBI Director
J. Edgar Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were getting ready for a commemorative ceremony to mark the
20th anniversary of the director's death in early 1997,'' Hillary
Robinnette, spokeswoman for the Society of Former Special Agents of
the FBI, told The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley pleaded innocent Friday at a hearing in U.S. District
Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charged Hanley, the only salaried employee of the
cemetery from 1988 to 1997, with stealing money paid by bereaved
families for funerals and gravestones. He also allegedly stole
donations paid by the Sons of the American Revolution and even the
fees charged to dog walkers.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery is the final resting place of some 60,000 people,
including Hoover, march composer John Philip Sousa, Civil War
photographer Matthew Brady and 80 members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   However, the cemetery, which depends largely on volunteers for
its upkeep, has fallen into disrepair and many headstones have been
destroyed by vandals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew something was wrong in 1996 when a man paid $8,000 for
a headstone and it never showed up,'' said Sharyn Danch, the lawyer
for the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional
Cemetery.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Erupts Twice in N. Japan  </HEADLINE>
By KOJI SASAHARA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- Northern Japan's Mount Usu spit out ash and
debris in two more major eruptions today, raising fears among
thousands of evacuees that they will be living at makeshift
shelters far longer than they thought.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Meteorological Agency said one of the eruptions
occurred before dawn today, and neither was believed to be as
intense as the initial eruption Friday, when the volcano came to
life after more than two decades of silence.
</P>
<P>
   But officials warned more were probably in store.
</P>
<P>
   ''Volcanic activities are intensifying and even larger eruptions
than the previous ones are highly likely,'' said agency official
Toshimitsu Niibe. ''We just don't know exactly how soon that will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Niibe urged residents and officials near the volcano, on the
northernmost main island of Hokkaido, to stay alert.
</P>
<P>
   Life for the more than 11,000 people forced to evacuate their
homes was growing increasingly difficult. Many evacuated several
days ago as earthquakes intensified prior to the eruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''I experienced the last eruption too, so I was prepared and
evacuated right away,'' said Yuko Takahashi, a nursing home
employee, referring to the last time the volcano erupted, in 1978.
''But I wonder how long we have to live like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have reported no damage or injuries from any of the
eruptions, although rice fields and other crops have been dusted
with a blanket of fine, volcanic ash.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuations left the nearby town of Abuta deserted except
for a few dogs wandering the streets. Some pets were left tied by
their owners, who assumed the evacuation would end soon.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that was not likely, and were also not ready to
allow even brief visits to check the homes.
</P>
<P>
   Haruo Imamoto, a garbage collector in Abuta, was worrying about
his livelihood after the eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the town is deserted I don't even have a job,'' he said
today from an evacuation center. ''Who knows how long it's going to
last -- a week, maybe even months? I'm worried about my job, but
there is nothing I can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said that evacuees might have to
stay for a while at makeshift centers set up in school gyms and
community halls. The government will consider building temporary
housing if that is the case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the centers, families sat on blankets spread out to mark
their private space. Some put up cardboard partitions, but there
was little else to give them any sense of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's explosion came with barely a sound, sending a
spectacular blue-gray plume of molten rock and ash billowing above
the crater and rolling down the snow-quilted slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Ash fluttered down and dusted ghostly silent, evacuated
villages. Sirens screaming warnings echoed through the empty
streets as ambulances and police cars cruised in search of damage.
</P>
<P>
   Farther away from the volcano, people climbed to rooftops to
watch the towering cloud that blossomed from the eruption Friday.
Some snapped photographs of the billowing debris and gas that rose
to a height of two miles.
</P>
<P>
   Falling snow increased concerns about mudslides in the lakeside
resort area. The military was called in because of concerns over
the possibility of landslides or mudslides caused by melting
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Mudslides triggered by Usu's last eruptions killed two people
and destroyed 200 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Fears also remained that Usu could spew a deadly mix of gas and
rocks -- called a pyroclastic flow -- that races down slopes and
incinerates everything in its path.
</P>
<P>
   About 51,000 people live in the coastal city of Date and several
smaller towns near Usu, 475 miles north of Tokyo. Experts had
predicted the eruption because of increased seismic activity that
began earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most eruption-prone countries, with
86 active volcanoes.

February, when veterans armed with spears, axes, clubs and guns smashed their

<HEADLINE> Political Donor Charged in NJ Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A grand jury has charged political donor
David Chang with funneling nearly $23,000 in illegal donations to
Sen. Robert Torricelli's 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, a 55-year-old businessman, also was charged Friday with
contacting a grand jury witness earlier in the week and encouraging
him to lie.
</P>
<P>
   The donor and his political aide, Audrey Yu, were charged in
December with conspiring to obstruct a federal investigation into
campaign finance abuses in Torricelli's campaign by destroying
records from one of his companies.
</P>
<P>
   Chang is to be arraigned on the new charges on April 15. His
April 25 trial is still set to go on as scheduled. If convicted of
all charges, he faces up to 80 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Chang has an unpublished telephone number and could not be
reached Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli's ability to raise $9.2 million in a 1996 race he won
over Rep. Richard A. Zimmer helped him be appointed to his current
position as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department task force investigating campaign finance
abuses has since secured three guilty pleas from Torricelli
contributors who said they made illegal donations to the campaign,
and the indictments of Chang and Yu.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Death Toll Passes Jonestown  </HEADLINE>
By HENRY WASSWA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Struggling with a lack of equipment after
uncovering a string of mass graves, police are regrouping before
tackling yet another compound where more victims of a doomsday cult
may be buried.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from the mass killing now stands at 924, after
police raised the number who died when a cult church was set ablaze
with hundreds of members sealed inside. Since then, mass graves at
three other compounds have uncovered more bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The government called a day of prayer Sunday to ''console
surviving relatives and assure the country that action is being
taken in pursuit of the criminal perpetrators.''
</P>
<P>
   Government and religious leaders will attend a memorial service
Sunday in Kanungu, the village where the cult slaying was first
revealed with the church inferno.
</P>
<P>
   While Ugandan authorities promised to apprehend the perpetrators
of the stabbings, burnings and stranglings, investigators showed no
signs of being able to track down sect leaders or even of being
able to confirm which -- if any -- survived.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators indefinitely postponed plans Friday to search a
fifth sect compound, deep in a rainforest near the Ruwenzori
Mountains along the Congolese border. Police said they would wait
until they had proper equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In Kanungu, forensic investigators examined a cemetery
overlooking the main compound of the Movement for the Restoration
of the Ten Commandments of God, to try to determine if any graves
there might contain more than one body. Finding nothing suspicious,
they did not dig.
</P>
<P>
   Police then retreated to the faraway capital of Kampala to await
pathology reports on some of the bodies already discovered, police
pathologist Thaddeus Barungi said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities initially reported at least 330 charred bodies were
found inside the ruins of a makeshift church in the sect's main
compound. On Friday, they raised the toll to 530 in what was
believed to have been a gasoline-fueled inferno in the sealed
church.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of bodies subsequently found at three other sites
apparently were killed after what had been the cult's prediction
that the world would end Dec. 31. Some victims appeared to have
been knifed or strangled. Hundreds were children, although the
devastation at the cult church and the possibility of more graves
means a precise count will never be known.
</P>
<P>
   The toll surpasses the November 1978 Peoples Temple tragedy at
Jonestown in the jungles of Guyana. The Jonestown mass suicide and
killings claimed 913 lives, including that of U.S. Rep. Leo Ryan,
journalists and a few defectors shot to death as they tried to
board a flight out.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan police are pursuing international arrest warrants for
Joseph Kibwetere, Credonia Mwerinde and three other suspected cult
leaders. It was not clear if any or all of them escaped the
killings or the fire that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders drew largely on disaffected Roman Catholics in
Uganda, leading many to give up their land to take up a strict
doctrine of fasting, silence and prayer. At least one leader was an
excommunicated Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Kenyatta, a member of Uganda parliament for the
Rukungiri district in the area of the killings, said Friday he had
been told the sect had branches in Tanzania and Rwanda as well,
with plans to move into Kenya.

<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Panicky police open fire on an escaped
tiger and end up killing a veterinarian. Mayhem erupts in a
courtroom after gang members smuggle grenades past police guards
into their own extortion trial. Officers blow up half an apartment
building trying to flush out a pair of murder suspects.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just this month. Little wonder that many Poles, who
feared police as a force of repression under the old communist
regime, now wonder whether the officers are up to their new role as
protectors.
</P>
<P>
   The police, for their part, beg understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ninety-nine percent of our actions are done correctly, but
only mistakes are noticed,'' said Pawel Biedziak, spokesman for
Poland's national police force. ''The police are like society: We
face similar problems like ordinary people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of communist rule in 1989, the once-powerful
police force has struggled to cope with increasingly bold
criminals, chronic funding shortages, poor training and a lack of
modern equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do their woes come so embarrassingly into focus as last
week, when officers chased down an escaped circus tiger in a Warsaw
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   With television cameras catching the action, the tiger turned on
a veterinarian who had shot a tranquilizer dart at the animal. The
officers opened fire -- killing the doctor. They managed to kill the
tiger a short time later, but that was little consolation. Three
officers now face disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, in the southwestern Polish city of Jelenia Gora,
gang members on trial for extortion managed to smuggle grenades
into the courtroom. After at least two exploded, anti-terrorist
police ended the melee by fatally shooting two of the defendants. A
special commission faulted guards who failed to search the
defendants after their repeated trips to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   In the Baltic port city of Szczecin, police overestimated the
explosive punch needed to blow open an apartment door. The
resulting blast caused extensive damage to the apartment building,
leaving the state with $50,000 repair bill.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Biedziak said police answer 5,000 calls daily
across Poland, usually without serious problems, and use weapons in
only about 100 cases a year. He also noted that police have made
solid progress against drug trafficking and organized crime, with
some major arrests in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials concede that this month's string of
highly publicized blunders reflect more than a mere run of bad
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Marek Biernacki acknowledged after the tiger
fiasco that police are unprepared for such emergencies, and ordered
that revised procedures be developed.
</P>
<P>
   Police complain about lack of training, sluggish courts and a
crime wave that washed over them in the sudden liberal atmosphere
that followed the collapse of communism in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The police force has changed as well. Gone are the elite
security forces that kept order under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''The transfer from (communist) militia to police has cost them
professionalism,'' argues one ex-communist politician and former
police officer, Jerzy Dziewulski.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, low pay -- averaging $480 a month for experienced
policemen -- has caused the best-trained officers to seek better
jobs elsewhere, Biedziak said. Starting pay of just $165 also makes
it tough to find good recruits.
</P>
<P>
   A report last year by a state Supreme Chamber of Control
complained that police have no clear requirements for candidates,
and that training is too heavy on theory and not enough on
practical police technique.
</P>
<P>
   Biedziak said motivation tests now result in the rejection of 80
percent of potential recruits, and practical training has replaced
the theory-based training methods.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin Looking To Upset Mich. St  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Wisconsin Badgers are trying pull off
their own version of ''Hoosiers.'' They've come to the right place.
</P>
<P>
   Milan High School's improbable state championship, chronicled in
the movie starring Gene Hackman, was won in Indianapolis. The
Badgers have even practiced at Hinkle Fieldhouse, where that famous
game was played 46 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen the movie at least 17 or 18 times,'' Wisconsin coach
Dick Bennett said Friday. ''I like Gene Hackman as an actor, always
have. I thought he was especially good in that movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett can't find his copy of ''Hoosiers,'' and he didn't bring
a ladder to Indy, either. Too bad. In the movie, Hackman climbed to
the rim, pulled out a tape measure and showed his players that the
basket at Hinkle was 10 feet high, just like any other court.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I eyeballed the rim,'' Bennett conceded, ''and it was 10
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Badgers (22-13), they'll be playing at the
RCA Dome instead of the historic fieldhouse today when they meet
Michigan State (30-7) in the national semifinals. Wisconsin needs
all the help it can get after losing three times to the Spartans
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is there a seed of doubt?'' Bennett said. ''I would be lying
if I said there wasn't. When a team beats you three times, you can
say that's a superior team.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should anyone believe the fourth meeting of the season
between these Big Ten rivals will be any different than the first
three? Michigan State routed the Badgers 61-44 in Madison in
February; Wisconsin played more respectably in losing the next two
meetings 59-54 and 55-46, the latter in the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans, the only top seed to reach Indy, began thinking
about winning their first national championship in 21 years as soon
as the horn sounded on their Final Four loss to Duke last season.
</P>
<P>
   A third straight Big Ten title wasn't enough. Mateen Cleaves,
one of the nation's best point guards, skipped a chance to play in
the NBA for this moment.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't come alone. The supporting cast -- A.J. Granger,
Morris Peterson, Andre Hutson and Charlie Bell -- is experienced and
title-worthy. The team is versatile on offense, stifling on defense
and highly motivated. The Spartans are the unquestioned favorite at
this Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really believe it totally, but I do embrace it,''
coach Tom Izzo said. ''This team can handle it. We've had the
bull's-eye on us for an entire year.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Wisconsin, which wasn't even one of the four best
teams in its own conference. The Badgers finished sixth in the Big
Ten, but they've won 11 of their last 14 games -- all three losses
coming against Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   ''To win this next game, most people think it's improbable,''
Wisconsin forward Andy Kowske said. ''We just go out and play
defense. That's our confidence right there, our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, defense. Bennett's turn-back-the-clock style of play
focuses on stopping the other team -- not a bunch of crowd-pleasing,
high-flying dunks. The Badgers have reached the 70s only four times
all season.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly? Sure. Effective? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We play the style of game that we have to play,'' Kowske said.
''If we tried to run and gun, everyone would run right by us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers are well aware of what they must do to reach Monday
night's title game against the North Carolina-Florida winner -- slow
things down offensively, never let up defensively, get down and
dirty on the boards. This is no time for a radical change.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are certain things we need to do better,'' Bennett said.
''But a change philosophically is certainly not an issue. We need
to be who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State expects nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teams like Wisconsin, you don't enjoy playing them,'' Cleaves
said. ''Unfortunately, we have to play them.''
</P>
<P>
   Again.

<HEADLINE> NYPD has released sealed records before, Safir says  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It had been done before, with no public outcry.
</P>
<P>
   So hours after Patrick Dorismond was fatally shot by police,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir decided
to release the unarmed man's sealed records because of past
experience. In three other cases involving people killed by cops,
those sealed records were unveiled, Safir testified Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''When considering whether to release Mr. (Patrick) Dorismond's
records, it was our understanding that disclosure of the sealed
records was lawful, since the records related to a deceased person
and therefore the records were no longer subject to the sealing
statutes,'' Safir said to the state Assembly committees on codes,
judiciary and children and families at the hearing held at John Jay
College of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts challenged that stance, saying a person's death
did not break the seal on closed records.
</P>
<P>
   Safir seemed perplexed over the amount of attention focused on
Dorismond's records.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the other three cases passed without comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said he released sealed records in another case, and his
predecessor, William Bratton, disclosed records in two other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone, Bratton said he did not have a ''specific
recollection'' of whether or not he released such records.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not saying that it did not occur, and I'm trying to
determine if it did,'' Bratton said, adding that he had placed
telephone calls with his former NYPD staff members to find out. He
did not expect the information to be available on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing focused on the legality of releasing sealed juvenile
records. Hours after Patrick Dorismond was fatally shot by an
undercover detective in Manhattan on March 16, Safir -- with
Giuliani's permission -- told reporters of Dorismond's criminal
history. The 26-year-old was arrested for robbery at age 13 and had
adult arrests for gun possession and assault.
</P>
<P>
   The juvenile case was dismissed and the record sealed; in the
other two cases, Dorismond pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of Dorismond's juvenile record outraged his
family, some lawmakers and community residents, and Giuliani and
Safir have been criticized heavily. Public Advocate Mark Green has
obtained a court order seeking a judicial inquiry into the matter.
And on Thursday, a group of clergy members abruptly ended a meeting
with Safir to discuss police and community relations when the
commissioner refused to apologize for releasing Dorismond's record.
</P>
<P>
   Safir, along with Michael Hess, head of the city's Law
Department, were grilled by Assembly members over their
interpretation of the Family Court Act. The law states that
juvenile records are sealed and not made available to any person or
private agency. The law does not address the issue of what happens
to the records when a person dies. And that's where the dispute is.
</P>
<P>
   The law expires when someone dies, Hess and Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statute is designed to protect the interests only of the
living,'' Hess said. ''There is no legal basis to apply them to a
deceased person.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts who testified disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never heard of a sealed court record in any court being
unsealed or released without a court order,'' said Merrill Sobie, a
professor at Pace University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statute says the record is sealed, period,'' said Monroe
Freedman, a professor at Hofstra Law School. ''Maybe it should be
amended to say: And Mr. Hess, we really mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Safir, Dorismond's death was investigated by an
NYPD ''shooting team.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Dorismond case, the shooting team checked (police)
department systems and learned of two adult arrests and one
juvenile arrest for the decedent,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not ask state court officials or Hess's office for
the records, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The information was then given to Safir in a memo, who then
verbally told Giuliani of Dorismond's record, the commissioner
said. The two then discussed if the record should be disclosed and
decided to do so. Hess was not consulted until after the record was
unsealed.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner also said releasing such information is a
''very rare exception,'' and to his knowledge, has only been done
three other times in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said in April 1997, he released the sealed juvenile record
of 16-year-old Kevin Cedeno, who was fatally shot by police. At the
time of the shooting, Cedeno was on probation for armed robbery,
Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   And when Bratton was commissioner, sealed records were disclosed
after Ernest Sayon, 22, and Anthony Rosario, 18, were fatally shot
by police, Safir said. Sayon was killed in April 1994, Rosario in
January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Safir stood by his reasoning for releasing the records -- to
present all the facts of the shooting to quell any potential
unrest. He disagreed with critics who said the detective who shot
Dorismond did not know about the man's juvenile record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though the officer was unaware of any arrest record that
night, a person's prior actions can illuminate his or her
personality and help to explain behavior that might otherwise be
inexplicable, and thereby serve to ameliorate what might become an
incident jeopardizing the safety of the public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul N. Samuels, president of the Legal Action Center in
Manhattan, said the sealing of juvenile records is necessary to
help juvenile delinquents become productive members of society.
</P>
<P>
   ''They make the mistake when they're young,'' Samuels said.
''Unsealing the records does not help them when they've turned
their lives around.''

<HEADLINE> Some Democrats worried about Giuliani fund raising lead  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rudolph Giuliani's $7 million fund-raising
lead over Hillary Rodham Clinton has some Democrats uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that Democrats were confidently predicting
the first lady would fill a $25 million Senate war chest and the
New York City mayor was painting himself as a cash-starved
underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that we're going to be outspent,'' Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle said Friday. ''The question is, can we keep that
gap as narrow as is possible, and that's going to take a real
concerted effort.'' Daschle met with Clinton about her campaign
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani raised about $7 million during the first three months
of this year, in addition to nearly $12 million he raised last
year. Clinton raised a little over $4 million for the Jan. 1
through March 31 period, in addition to the $8 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jordan, political director for the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, said the party needed to refocus it's efforts
on New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of us in the party need to be concerned about what
Giuliani has raised,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe Democrats have been complacent about her needs,'' Jordan
said. ''Maybe we underestimated the fund-raising powers of the
mayor of the richest city in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's operation declined comment but appeared at
least a little nervous by the totals.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, after Giuliani released his tally, an e-mail went
out from the Clinton campaign appealing for last-minute
contributions over the Internet before the close of the campaign
filing period Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is still time to send a signal that you reject Rudy
Giuliani's negative tactics and support Hillary's positive
message,'' the letter from Clinton campaign manager Bill de Blasio
said. ''We have 24 more hours in this filing.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail letter asked the recipient to forward the letter to
five friends.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani camp used the same tactic as the close of the last
filing period neared, Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum, reached as the
mayor raised even more money in Arizona on Friday, said the totals
demonstrate ''sagging support for her campaign, while our numbers
suggest just the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising news for Giuliani came as Clinton pulled even
with him in the polls. Those surveys showed the mayor had been hurt
by his handling of the police shooting of Patrick Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   Still, New York Republican consultant Jay Severin said
Giuliani's cash lead was an embarrassment that indicated Clinton's
campaign was ''not ready for prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democrats should not have been surprised by this,'' he
said. ''They should have been better equipped and they should have
been stronger out of the gate, especially with an untested
first-time candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf predicted Clinton would
have the money she needed for the race and said Giuliani's cash
lead ''will energize the Democratic party elders to get things
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Severin or Sheinkopf is involved in the Senate contest.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's $19 million shattered fund-raising records in New
York set when then-Rep. Charles Schumer defeated incumbent Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato in 1998. Giuliani has already raised more money
than Schumer raised in total for that race, which cost a total of
$35 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer noted Friday that money isn't always an indicator of
success.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al D'Amato outspent me and I won,'' Schumer said. ''In a
high-profile race it's your views that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Schumer's win over D'Amato, there have been other
occasions where the candidate with the most money has failed to
win. Oliver North's better-financed campaign against U.S. Sen.
Charles Robb of Virginia failed. So did Michael Huffington's bid
against U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California.

<HEADLINE> China Bars Snow's Widow From Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Filmed and tailed by Chinese security agents, the
widow of famed American journalist Edgar Snow tried today to
deliver money, a book and moral support to a woman whose son was
killed in the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. Authorities
prevented the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Snow had hoped that a meeting with Ding Zilin, who has
campaigned for victims of the crackdown, would focus Chinese
leaders' attention on the plight of Ding and the scores of others
like her who have never received compensation or an official
apology for the deaths of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   But plainclothes agents followed Snow's car from her hotel to
the People's University where Ding lives, swerved in front of the
car when it pulled up at the school gates and watched and filmed
while Snow, her son and a family friend tried to go inside.
</P>
<P>
   With plainclothes agents in sunglasses hovering nearby,
university security officials barred the way and told the Snows and
a friend of Ding's who met them at the gate that they could not
come in without official permission.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the campus, meanwhile, around a dozen security agents
prevented Ding, a retired professor, from leaving her home, Ding
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told me: 'You can't go out,' '' she said. ''I said, 'How
can you be so cruel? She's an old friend of China.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Snow, who arrived Friday, had not visited China since the
Tiananmen Square crackdown because of her anger over the bloodshed.
Her decision to come back to meet Ding, and to visit her husband's
grave, presented an embarrassing challenge to the authorities
because of Edgar Snow's renown in China for his reporting of the
Communist Party's long struggle to take power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, Edgar Snow became the first Western journalist to
interview Mao Tse-tung and other communist leaders when they were
still known as ''Red Bandits,'' fighting a guerrilla war that
finally overthrew the Nationalists in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, 79, lives in Switzerland. She first came to China in 1970
with her husband, on what was to be his last visit before his death
in 1972. She met Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai, the leaders Snow
described vividly in his 1937 book ''Red Star Over China,'' which
focused international attention on the then-struggling Chinese
communist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Ding, meanwhile, has led a quiet campaign to seek redress from
the government for the crackdown on democracy protesters in 1989,
in which hundreds or possibly thousands of people, including Ding's
17-year-old son, Jiang Jielian, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite frequent police harassment, Ding has collected the names
of victims and distributed donations from abroad to victims'
families.
</P>
<P>
   Because she was unable to meet Ding in person, Snow gave a book
of photos taken by her husband as well as an envelope of money and
a statement of support to the friend who met her, Su Bingxian, who
also lost a son in the crackdown. Su said she would pass them on to
Ding.
</P>
<P>
   Snow signed the book ''To Ding Zilin and all the mothers, in
friendship and admiration ... Hoping to see you in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chinese authorities are always saying Edgar Snow is a
friend of China,'' said Snow's son, Chris. ''I don't feel this is a
friendly way to behave.''

<HEADLINE> UNC, Florida Coaches Share Little  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Florida coach Billy Donovan is 34 and played
in the Final Four 13 years ago as a senior at Providence.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina coach Bill Guthridge is 64 and he'll tell you why
he didn't play in the Final Four 42 years ago as a sophomore at
Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was Tex Winter's fault for not putting me in. We might
have won that game,'' Guthridge said. ''But I wasn't very good, and
obviously, he made the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The two will face each other tonight in the second game of the
national semifinals with the winner advancing to Monday night's
championship game against Michigan State or Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, the sixth man to coach and play in a Final Four, and
Guthridge, a minute of playing time away from being the seventh,
don't have a whole lot in common.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (28-7) uses full-court pressure and a 10-man rotation to
wear down opponents, as it did in beating fourth-seeded Illinois,
top-ranked Duke and third-seeded Oklahoma State in reaching the
Final Four for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina (22-13) turned around an inconsistent season with
its first four-game winning streak, reaching the Final Four for the
15th time in school history, tying UCLA for the record.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-seeded Tar Heels have a seven-man rotation, and to
handle Florida's pressure they will rely heavily on senior point
guard Ed Cota, in his third Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely two different styles of play, two different
systems,'' Florida's Kenyan Weaks said. ''I think whoever executes
that system better is going to win the game. Hopefully, that will
be us.''
</P>
<P>
   While the younger Tar Heels can turn to Cota for advice on
playing in the Final Four, the Gators will turn to Donovan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the one thing I realize after going through as a
player is that I can relate a little bit to the emotions they're
going through,'' Donovan said. ''This is the first time any of our
kids have had the privilege to be part of something so special, the
pinnacle of college basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge was an assistant at Kansas State for his second Final
Four and was next to Dean Smith at North Carolina for 10 more. This
is his second as head coach of the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be here in the Final Four, it's a real thrill,'' Guthridge
said. ''It doesn't get old, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   But North Carolina hasn't seen anything like Florida's press.
And with a seven-man rotation, the Tar Heels can't be too thrilled
about facing it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The starters, we're used to playing 38 minutes and better,''
said Cota, who has played 159 of a possible 160 minutes in the
tournament. ''Florida has a lot guys they're going to throw at us.
We need to go out there and try to control tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-seeded Gators have been a new team since defeating
Butler in overtime in the first round on Mike Miller's
buzzer-beater. Since then, top-ranked Duke has come the closest
(87-78) to beating them.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the Butler game taught the team that ''it's going to
take all 10 of us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It also taught us that anyone can win; it doesn't matter what
it says on the front of your jersey,'' said Miller, the MVP of the
East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Few names have as impressive an NCAA tournament history as North
Carolina, in its third Final Four in four years. But the latest
trip was the least likely of all.
</P>
<P>
   ''All year long we had an up-and-down season,'' said Cota, only
the third player in NCAA history to have more than 1,000 assists.
''We can't blame anybody for writing us off or our fans for
criticizing us and stuff like that because we deserved it. But we
handled it well. The coaches had the patience with us, and we just
believed. That's why we're here now.''

<HEADLINE> Kelley Defines Wisconsin's D  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Dick Bennett came to Mike Kelley preaching
self-sacrifice, teamwork and defense. Unlike many blue-chip
recruits, Kelley listened and believed.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, the Wisconsin Badgers' junior point guard, has become a
walking, talking and (sometimes) hacking defensive star. On a team
stocked with above-average defenders and built around a suffocating
style, Kelley is the stopper.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love the way we play,'' Kelley said. ''I think it's
beautiful. To the outside observer who isn't a part of our program,
I think it's viewed as ugly by many people, but I don't know how
you can't enjoy that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers' trip to the Final Four and today's meeting with
Michigan State are due in no small part to Kelley, the two-time Big
Ten defensive player of the year. He has a formula for playing the
kind of defense coaches love but players usually have no time for.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nothing fancy,'' Kelley said. ''It's just working hard
and waiting for your opportunities. You've got to watch and wait.
These days, not many players like to work that hard, and not many
players like to wait that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley has almost as many steals (93) as field-goal attempts
(94) this season. A junior, he already owns Wisconsin's career
steals record. He plays so aggressively his own coach criticized
him for trying too hard for loose balls and errant passes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the toughest thing about Kelley is getting him to take
credit for his efforts. If not for his suffocating play against
Purdue star Jaraan Cornell in four games this year, the Badgers'
season would have ended long before this.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin split with Purdue during the regular season, but beat
the Boilermakers in the Big Ten tournament and in the West Regional
final. In those four games, Kelley held Cornell to a total of 26
points on 9-for-42 shooting (21 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Kelley was constantly in Cornell's face, holding him, pushing
him, fouling him hard when the occasion demanded. In all three
losses, Cornell nearly snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was swearing, saying he was going to break my nose, all
this stuff,'' Kelley laughed. ''I think we might have been under
his skin a little bit -- OK, a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley hasn't been as effective against Michigan State's Mateen
Cleaves in the Badgers' three losses to the Spartans this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We respect their defense a lot, because it's probably one of
the best ones we faced,'' Cleaves said. ''Kelley is a great
defensive player. We have to play even a notch harder against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley is probably the Badgers' most recognizable player -- which
isn't saying much for a bunch that puts team first and failed to
place even one player on the Big Ten's honorable mention list. But
Bennett has no problem singling out Kelley, his on-court leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has the greatest capacity for concentration of any player
I've been around,'' Bennett said. ''He's able to focus on what he
needs to do for every second he's in the game. He doesn't get down
when he gets beat. He just dusts himself off and goes right to work
on beating you again.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Kelley said he accepted a scholarship to play for Bennett
''before he could even offer it,'' their relationship hasn't always
been harmonious. When Kelley put himself on the bench because of
foul trouble in several consecutive games in January, Bennett
called him selfish and too concerned about breaking Wisconsin's
career steals record.
</P>
<P>
   The rift healed quickly, but Kelley continued fighting for every
scrap on every defensive stand. He played in the conference
tournament with a painful thigh bruise and stitches to close a gash
near his eye. His ankles were sore all season. He sprained several
fingers and got his thumb stuck under somebody's sneaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''He sees things on the floor that I don't see,'' forward Andy
Kowske said. ''He anticipates so well. You put all that together in
a point guard, and you're going to get a lot of steals.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this team didn't have him, we wouldn't be here.''

<HEADLINE> Mich St. Players Form Partnership  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The longer he stays in the business, the
less Tom Izzo needs to hear the sound of his own voice.
</P>
<P>
   ''My players have a partnership in this team,'' he said. ''It's
not a dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo has guided Michigan State to three straight Big Ten
championships and a second straight Final Four berth. But he's not
above listening to his players, even at the biggest moments. Last
week, for example, in the Midwest Regional championship against
Iowa State, star forward Morris Peterson suggested an alley-oop
play during a late timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ''That sounds great,'' Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   When play resumed, the Spartans ran the play, and Peterson
delivered the crucial basket. As a result, Michigan State (30-7)
will play Wisconsin (22-13) today for the fourth time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of coaches, they don't really let their players
get involved in some of their plays,'' Peterson said. ''I think
that's what kind of separates coach Izzo. He can really relate to
his players.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's always willing to listen to them and get some of their
input.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzo also holds his players accountable -- for their dreams as
well as his own. Peterson and point guard Mateen Cleaves both want
to play in the NBA. Izzo has pushed the two seniors hard to make
sure they make it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We set up the game plan to get them there,'' Izzo said. ''If
they deviate from that game plan and I didn't say something, I
would be cheating them out of an opportunity of a lifetime and a
dream.
</P>
<P>
   ''And that's the way I look at it. So we have a common respect.
I have my dreams and goals and I think they do, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzo brought the Spartans to Indianapolis on Wednesday night,
long before they needed to be in town. A sure sign Izzo was getting
a little nervous, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all.
</P>
<P>
   After a light workout at a nearby college gym, Izzo turned his
players loose. He told them to go have fun. Naturally, Cleaves, the
heart of this team, steered most of the players downtown to watch --
what else? -- a basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a great coach-player relationship,'' Cleaves said.
''He lets his players have input on what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That unity of purpose might be one reason why the Spartans have
been able to come back from deep deficits to win their last three
tournament games. The coach and his players almost always think
alike.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to treat people like I'd want to be treated myself, and
my parents,'' Izzo said. ''You have a responsibility to do your
job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am what I am, and I can't hide that. I'm honest with my
players about that. I'm honest with them when I recruit them.''
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean Izzo won't crack down now and then. He will.
</P>
<P>
   In order to teach Peterson a lesson during his freshman year,
Izzo left him home while the rest of the team traveled to a
tournament in Hawaii. Izzo also has disciplined the fun-loving
Cleaves a couple of times over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the few misfortunes he's had, you know, adversity
sometimes brings you closer,'' Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with Cleaves is especially important to Izzo.
For one thing, Cleaves was his first big-time recruit. For another,
Cleaves is the point guard, a position Izzo views as a coach on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it was Izzo's position during his own playing days.
</P>
<P>
   ''For all those reasons, I think the relationship has grown,''
Izzo said. ''And it's like all relationships, not always perfect,
but I have great respect for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have great respect for his ability to come to practice day
in, day out and be the hardest worker and a guy that really lays it
on the line.''

   BEIJING (AP) -- Filmed and tailed by Chinese security agents, the widow of
famed American journalist Edgar Snow tried Saturday to deliver money, a book and
moral support to a woman whose son was killed in the 1989 Tiananmen Square
crackdown. Authorities prevented the meeting. Lois Snow had hoped that a meeting
with Ding Zilin, who has campaigned for victims of the crackdown, would focus
Chinese leaders' attention on the plight of Ding and the scores of others like
her who have never received compensation or an official apology for the deaths
of their loved ones.

<HEADLINE> Donovan Brings Success to Florida  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Billy Donovan everybody sees has the
slicked-back hair, the New York accent and a high-octane
personality that seems hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   In more private moments, with players on recruiting trips and on
the practice floor, it's a different Donovan, but no less
personable.
</P>
<P>
   It's the many long hours the coach has invested to earn the
trust of his players that has helped put Florida within two
victories of its first national title.
</P>
<P>
   So says point guard Brett Nelson, a McDonald's All-American from
West Virginia. He had his pick of schools coming out of high
school. He got to know Donovan in junior high. He chose the Gators,
and has been rewarded with a trip to the Final Four in his freshman
year.
</P>
<P>
   Florida plays North Carolina tonight in the national semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I probably would have gone wherever he was going, because I
built a relationship with him when he was at Marshall,'' Nelson
said. ''That's how much I trust and care for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Miller says the same thing. Like Nelson, Miller could have
gone wherever he wanted after graduating from Mitchell High School
in South Dakota. And like Nelson, Miller's recruiting process with
Donovan had a more personal feel.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're going to make the decision I had to make, you might
as well do it with someone you trust,'' Miller said. ''I trusted
coach Donovan and what he was trying to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donovan bristles when he's labeled a salesman. He says
there's much more to his recruiting and coaching style than the
slicked-back hair, the constant Long Island jabber and the
high-octane personality.
</P>
<P>
   He considers himself a student of the game, a disciple of the
Rick Pitino method and a true ''player's coach.'' At 34, he's still
young enough to relate to these kids, both in their homes and on
the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   He knows what it's like to play in the Final Four. He did that
with Providence in 1987. He knows what it's like to coach in the
Final Four, too. He did as Pitino's assistant at Kentucky in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very happy when he came here,'' said Kenyan Weaks, the
only Florida player left who was recruited by Donovan's
predecessor, Lon Kruger. ''I knew his background. I knew he had
played in the Final Four. I knew he would give us a chance to get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan's system worked when he was at Marshall, taking a team
from nine to 18 wins in his first season. It's working at Florida,
where he has revived a program and -- for a moment anyway -- pushed
his frenetic brand of Billy Ball past football coach Steve
Spurrier's Fun 'N' Gun as the most exciting offense on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to make it fun,'' said Pitino, now coach of the
Boston Celtics. ''He had a lot of fun as a player, so his Florida
kids are having a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But before the fun, there is work.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan runs one of the most stringent conditioning programs in
college basketball. Part of it is a bonding experience, but more
than that, it's a program that helps this team survive.
</P>
<P>
   If the team is in better shape, Donovan promises, it will pay
off down the road. Last week, Florida beat Duke in the regional
semifinals because it could outrun the Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes with playing time. Miller or Nelson could have
gone elsewhere, could have averaged 30 minutes and 20 points a
game. But by believing in their coach and sacrificing those
numbers, the team succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino didn't think it could happen at Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He watched his disciple spend too much time developing, turning
himself from nothing into something, as a player and coach, to
watch him throw it away with the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino recalls a conversation with athletic director Jeremy
Foley. His biggest concern was whether Foley would have the
patience to give Donovan the time he needed to build the program.
</P>
<P>
   Foley assured Pitino he did.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then you've got the best young coach in the game,'' Pitino
promised.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's hard to argue with Pitino's guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mike Miller didn't come to the University of Florida because
it's the University of Florida and he didn't come for the
basketball tradition,'' Nelson said. ''He's here, and really all
these guys are here, basically because of the coach.''

<HEADLINE> N. Carolina's Forte Has Big Role  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Joseph Forte is a rarity in a North Carolina
system that emphasizes seniors.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman was voted to carry the team's green trainer's bag
this season -- a longstanding tradition started under former coach
Dean Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But the 6-foot-4 Forte also is carrying a little heavier load
these days for the Tar Heels at the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel like a freshman any more,'' Forte said Friday
after North Carolina's practice at the RCA Dome in preparation for
tonight's NCAA national semifinal against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the end of the season came and the NCAA tournament
started I felt like I was an upperclassman and I tried to play like
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte hasn't disappointed. The guard is on pace to become the
first North Carolina freshmen to lead the team in scoring (16.7)
since freshmen became eligible in 1972-73.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic Coast Conference rookie of the year had 22 points
in North Carolina's victory over Tennessee in the South Regional
semifinals, then a season-high 28 against Tulsa as the Tar Heels
advanced to their 15th Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Forte's older teammates appreciate the maturity of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's showing what sort of player he is,'' Jason Capel said.
''We know he's a good shooter. But to me he's a player. You shut
down one part of his game on offense and he'll find another way to
score. He's a very complete player, a great scorer and a fierce
competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte remains soft spoken, even after former North Carolina
player James Worthy compared his game to the Tar Heels' most famous
basketball star -- Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the highest compliment I can receive as a player,''
Forte said. ''It's just great. I don't think I am him or have
surpassed him. There is no pressure, just opportunity to go out
there and prove the nice things people say about me are true.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte was a high school All-American at prep powerhouse DeMatha
in Maryland. He heard about the North Carolina tradition of
freshmen playing subordinate roles and didn't expect to crack the
starting lineup when he arrived in Chapel Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I would come off the bench and just help the team by
hitting a couple of threes and sit back down,'' he said. ''The best
case scenario would be to average 10 or 12 points. I was playing my
expectations safe. I didn't want to go too extreme with this. I
exceeded them.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte said his biggest challenge wasn't necessarily on the
court. He had to face an emotional hurdle of replacing junior Max
Owens in the starting lineup in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''Max Owens has been here for three years and a lot of people
love Max and wanted to see him play,'' Forte said. ''So, I had to
come in here and change some minds and change some hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistency has been Forte's best asset this season, as well as
his development of a mid-range jumper he plans to use against the
Gators.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's ahead of his time, a freshman who understands how
to play,'' Florida forward Mike Miller said. ''He's got a scorer's
mentality. He understands what positions he needs to be in to score
at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte's recent scoring outburst in the NCAA tournament was
somewhat unexpected after going a combined 9-for-33 in a loss to
Wake Forest in the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament and an NCAA
tourney victory against Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's when I really learned the difference between just
shooting and good shots,'' Forte said. ''I thought after the Wake
Forest game it was just me having a bad night. Then I did it in
back-to-back games. That's when my eyes got opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida guard Teddy Dupay said the Gators plan to pay close
attention to the hot-scoring Forte.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll throw a lot of people at him,'' Dupay said. ''There
could be six of seven (different) guys on him.''

<HEADLINE> Kwan Trails Russians at Worlds  </HEADLINE>
By SALVATORE ZANCA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France (AP) -- Michelle Kwan is far from the top of the
class in the World Figure Skating Championships.
</P>
<P>
   As graceful as ever, the UCLA freshman still bobbled on a triple
flip during the short program Friday and was third going into the
final free skate.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan scaled back on training in the fall, but shifted the
balance back toward skating in the winter, moving out of the dorm
and taking fewer classes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year has been completely different for me,'' the two-time
world champion said. ''It's been a lot of fun. The first quarter at
school was hard. I had a full load and competitions coming up. I
didn't skate as much as I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Maria Butyrskaya used an elegant program that emphasized
her maturity to beat Russian Irina Slutskaya and Kwan, even though
both had slightly more difficult jumps in the technically dominant
short program.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Hughes of Great Neck, N.Y., at 14 the youngest competitor,
finished fifth, placing fourth overall going into the final free
skate. Angela Nikodinov of San Pedro, Calif., was sixth in the
short, and is seventh overall.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan's chances of winning her third world title were marginal,
even with 50 percent of the total score at stake in today's free
program.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. champion appeared tense going on to the ice but seemed
to relax after hitting a fine double axel and a triple lutz-double
toe combination. The program, to an orchestral version of the
Lennon-McCartney hit ''A Day in the Life,'' flowed into her
graceful spirals, which she held for nearly the length of the rink,
then let go a bit with a hip swivel when the pace picked up.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan's only real problem was the landing on the triple flip,
which was added to the program to increase the difficulty. Her
technical marks were mostly 5.6s and 5.7s with one 5.4.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a little bobble after the triple flip,'' Kwan said.
''But I'm glad I went for it. ... I felt really good out there, but
I let loose and had a lot of fun.'''
</P>
<P>
   Old in skaters' years at 27, Butyrskaya diverted all attention
from the much ballyhooed Kwan-Slutskaya rivalry with a softly
skated romantic program to Sarah Brightman's ''Scene d'amour.''
With all the elements performed perfectly, the judges didn't seem
bothered that her optional jump was the less-difficult triple loop
to the triple flip jumped by Slutskaya and Kwan. It was only after
that officials revealed she had lightly cut two right fingers
cleaning her blade before going on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Though she beat an ailing Kwan at last year's worlds, Butyrskaya
has often been overlooked going into major competitions, partly
because of her age and partly because she tends to save her best
skating for the end of the season. The six-time Russian champion is
somewhat of a late-bloomer, winning her first major title in 1998
in Milan.
</P>
<P>
   ''When there's a long season, it's important to know when you
get your best form,'' said Butyrskaya's coach, Yelena
Tchaikovskaya. ''Maria Butyrskaya came to this competition in her
best form.''
</P>
<P>
   France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat ended Russia's
eight-year lock on the ice dance title with an intense and
intricately choreographed free program to the gothic chants of
''Carmina Burana'' that earned four 6.0s for presentation
</P>
<P>
   Americans Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev were eighth, and
former junior world champions Jamie Silverstein and Justin Pekarek
finished 12th.

   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Carolina Hurricanes put themselves back
into playoff contention. Now it's the Buffalo Sabres turn to play
catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   The topsy-turvy Eastern Conference race took another twist as
the Hurricanes, sparked by Paul Coffey's winning goal with 7:34
remaining, beat the Sabres 3-1 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory catapulted the Hurricanes ahead of Buffalo and into
a tie with idle Montreal for the conference's eighth and final
playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   It was big game for both teams, but especially the Hurricanes,
who have only four games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''Absolutely, it was our biggest test,'' Hurricanes coach Paul
Maurice said. ''I can't tell you how much I enjoyed standing behind
the bench and watching those guys work that hard. ... Quite
honestly, if we didn't win, that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres, who as recently as Wednesday afternoon sat alone in
eighth place, were left wondering what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've put ourselves in a situation where it looks like we're
going to have to win every game,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said.
''Carolina's put themselves in a good position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres, who have five games remaining, play Montreal
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   In other NHL games Friday night, it was New Jersey 6, Atlanta 0;
Florida 3, Ottawa 1; Nashville 2, Vancouver 1; and Phoenix 3,
Calgary 1.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey, who has scored his share of big goals, considered Friday
night's winner against Buffalo his biggest as a member of the
Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Using Sabres defenseman Richard Smehlik as a screen, Coffey
snapped a low shot that hit the stick of goalie Dominik Hasek and
then flipped up and into the net. The puck might also have tipped
in off Hurricanes forward Gary Roberts, who was battling for
position in front.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be honest, I think if we lost tonight, we're pretty much
done,'' said Coffey, second among NHL defenseman with 394 goals.
''It gives us some confidence now and hopefully we can keep it
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ranheim scored the Hurricanes' first goal and Sean Hill
closed the scoring with an open-net goal with 4.9 seconds left.
Vaclav Varada scored for the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
Devils 6, Thrashers 0
</P>
<P>
   At East Rutherford, N.J., Scott Gomez had a goal and two assists
as New Jersey took sole possession of first place in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the slumping Devils -- 7-12-2 in their last 21
games -- a two-point lead over Washington. Atlanta has lost five in
a row, is winless in its last seven and has just one victory in its
last 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur made 22 saves for his sixth shutout of the season
and 42nd of his career.
</P>
<P>
Panthers 3, Senators 1
</P>
<P>
   At Sunrise, Fla., Mike Vernon stopped 32 shots and won his fifth
consecutive start as Florida handed Ottawa its fifth loss in eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, winners of five of their last seven, are three
points ahead of Ottawa for the fifth playoff spot in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Len Barrie, Ray Sheppard and Viktor Kozlov scored for the
Panthers.
</P>
<P>
Predators 2, Canucks 1
</P>
<P>
   At Nashville, Tenn., Vitali Yachmenev's power-play goal late in
the second period lifted the Predators and hurt Vancouver's playoff
chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks are 10th in the Western Conference, three points
behind eighth-place San Jose. The Canucks have four games left and
close the season April 9 at San Jose.
</P>
<P>
Coyotes 3, Flames 1
</P>
<P>
   At Calgary, Alberta, Phoenix won despite being outshot 31-12.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Adams had two goals and Jeremy Roenick scored his 12th
game-winner of the season for the Coyotes, who moved into sole
possession of sixth place in the Western Conference, two points
ahead of Edmonton. The Coyotes play the Oilers tonight.

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Marks the Tradition  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- In his fifth start on the Senior PGA
Tour, Tom Kite is getting closer to meeting his expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Kite and Larry Nelson braved cold and wet conditions Friday to
reach 8 under before darkness forced the suspension of play in the
second round of the Tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Kite finished 14 holes and Nelson 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been there before, but it's been a while, and this really
feels good,'' Kite said. ''My putting has been rock-solid, I'm
hitting the ball really well and I'm in good position.''
</P>
<P>
   Lightning forced a delay of 1 hour, 40 minutes early, and rain
stopped it again for 2 hours, 17 minutes. The almost four hours of
inactivity on the Cochise Course at Desert Mountain seemed like a
replay of last year's Tradition, when snowstorms wiped out two
rounds of the tour's first major tournament of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The unique thing about being up in the mountains is that they
apparently attract and cultivate these storms,'' said Brian
Henning, the Senior PGA Tour's vice president of competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one of the 74 players were unable to finish the round
Friday. Of those who did, first-round leader Jim Ahern was the best
for the second day.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahern, who shot 7-under 65 on Thursday, struggled. He had a
double bogey and two bogeys in the first seven holes and carded a
75 for a 4-under 140 total -- still enough to give him sole
possession of third on the leaderboard, behind only Kite and
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   John Jacobs was two shots behind Ahern, and George Archer, Joe
Inman and Ed Dougherty followed at 143.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Eastwood, Walt Morgan, Gary McCord and Bruce Fleisher, the
only two-time winner in nine events this season, were at 144.
</P>
<P>
   Kite, who turned 50 in December, won $10.5 million and 19
tournaments on the regular tour, including the 1992 U.S. Open. Now,
after finishing ninth, 20th, 12th and 47th in a so-so start to his
senior career, he is in the hunt for a major crown.
</P>
<P>
   His approach shots were steady all day -- the longest of his
three birdie putts was from 12 feet, and he dropped 7-iron shots 6
feet from the pin on No. 2, and 3 feet away on No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   But the 7-iron let him down on the fourth hole, a par-5 where
Kite made his only bogey of the tournament. The ball went over the
back of the green, and Kite left himself a 12-foot par putt when he
chipped back. Instead, he two-putted.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who began the round 4 under, bogeyed the first hole in
the gloom of approaching thunder clouds and also bogeyed No. 10,
but offset them with six birdies.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the weather on early starters were apparent on
Morgan, who was tied with Kite a shot behind Ahern when the round
began. In a terrible stretch from the fourth hole through the
seventh, Morgan lost six shots by scoring bogey, bogey, bogey,
triple bogey-6.

<HEADLINE> Sindelar Leads BellSouth Classic  </HEADLINE>
By ED SHEARER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DULUTH, Ga. (AP) -- Joey Sindelar is as qualified as anyone to
discuss slumps.
</P>
<P>
   He's been mired in one so far this season, missing the cut in
six events before turning things around to take a one-stroke lead
into today's third round of the BellSouth Classic.
</P>
<P>
   He's gone through other slumps during his first 19 years on the
PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Do they worry him?
</P>
<P>
   ''It depends on what is wrong,'' said Sindelar, who has overcome
a broken wrist and stress fracture in his foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the last month and a half, I feel like a guy walking
around and there is a bunch of rakes in the front yard and I keep
stepping on them and hitting myself in the nose.''
</P>
<P>
   Sindelar said he has had slumps where he wasn't playing well and
didn't know where he was going. ''That,'' he said, ''is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   This slump isn't like that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This slump is more of a scoring ability, 'Come on let's get
with it, quit making the dumb mistakes kind.' Got to play your way
through this rather that the ball-striking kind of slump that is
very painful, and I am very happy to not be there.''
</P>
<P>
   His slump hasn't shown itself during his first two trips around
the hilly TPC Sugarloaf layout north of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He shot a 6-under-par 66 on Friday for a 10-under 134 total.
John Huston was second after a 67.
</P>
<P>
   It took an even-par 144 total to make the cut. Seventy-seven
players survived the cut, and one more may join them early today
when Jimmy Green shows up to play the 18th hole. He elected not to
finish Friday when the horn blew to suspend play for darkness. He
stands at 1 under through 17 and needs a bogey or better to survive
the cut.
</P>
<P>
   First-round leader Paul Stankowski and Phil Mickelson were two
strokes back. Stankowski shot a 70, and Mickelson had a 69.
</P>
<P>
   Six others were tied at 137 -- Harrison Frazar with a 68, Dave
Stockton and Gary Nicklaus with 69s and Jean Van de Velde, Blaine
McCallister and Kenny Perry with 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on the back nine, Sindelar parred the first four holes
before putting together consecutive birdies with 8- and 15-foot
putts. He missed a 3{-footer for birdie on No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Sindelar made a 30-foot birdie putt on No. 2, and a 10-footer
No. 3. He made a short birdie putt on No. 7, and closed with a
six-footer on the ninth green.
</P>
<P>
   Huston had seven birdies and two bogeys in his round, sinking
two putts of 20 feet and another from 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion David Duval shot a 69 for a 142 total. Greg
Norman, who designed the course, bogeyed his final four holes but
still make the cut with a 144 total. He shot a 73.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, who was two shots off the lead when the day began,
ran into trouble early when he took a 10 on the par-4 fifth hole,
taking two penalty strokes when his ball rolled back off the green
into a creek. He shot a 77 to miss the cut with a 145 total.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Raul Mondesi still hasn't gotten over his anger at
the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mondesi, who forced a trade out of Los Angeles, was plunked
twice in his first game against the Dodgers and had to go to the
hospital as the Toronto Blue Jays won 10-4 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser nailed Mondesi on his left arm in the second
inning, and Mondesi muttered obscenities after Matt Herges hit him
on the left hand in the fourth inning. He went to the hospital for
X-rays, which showed no break.
</P>
<P>
   ''They better throw harder because the baseball is not going to
hurt me,'' Mondesi said. ''I don't know why they threw at me twice.
There's something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The moody right-fielder looked like he wanted to make a
statement early. He hit the first pitch he saw for an RBI single in
the first inning. He moved to second on the throw into the infield,
and moved to third on a short fly ball to left.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't do it because it was against the Dodgers, I just play
hard every time,'' Mondesi said.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green, traded for Mondesi, had a more pleasant experience
in his first game against his former team. Green, who received a
mix of boos and cheers, walked in his first at-bat, and hit into
double play in his second at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to see old friends, but it's really tough to see
all my buddies I grew up with through baseball and not get a chance
to be on their team.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Batista and Darrin Fletcher hit back-to-back homers in the
first inning for the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   At Winter Haven Fla., Richie Sexson bruised his right knee in a
collision with the left-field wall and Minnesota banged around
starter Charles Nagy before Cleveland rallied to win 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Walker homered leading off the game and Butch Huskey, who
had five RBIs, had a two-run double in the first on the shot that
sent Sexson into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8 Sexson, primarily a first baseman and DH during his
career, laid motionless for a few moments on the warning track
before walking off the field on his own. X-rays were negative.
</P>
<P>
   ''That kind of popped a little scare into us,'' Indians manager
Charlie Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson was scared, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fine. My kneecap just kind of slid out a little bit,''
Sexson said. ''It was painful, like running into concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the Giants opened their new ballpark with an
8-3 win over the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2{ years in the making and the first privately financed
major league baseball stadium in 38 years, Pacific Bell Park was
inaugurated before a sellout crowd of 40,930.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beauty of this stadium is phenomenal,'' said Barry Bonds,
whose line-drive double in the first drove in San Francisco's first
run. ''There's always pros and cons with any stadium but this
definitely has more pros than cons. I just feel it's an outstanding
ballpark and the people love it.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Marlins 7, Royals 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Melbourne, Fla., Brant Brown, battling Mark Kotsay for
Florida's starting right field job, went 3-for-4 with two RBIs.
White Sox 11, Mariners 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Las Vegas, Paul Konerko homered twice and drove in four runs,
and Frank Thomas also had four RBIs for Chicago.
Braves 5, Orioles 0:
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta, Andruw Jones hit his team-leading seventh home run
of the spring and Terry Mulholland and five relievers combined on a
five-hitter.
Expos 8, Pirates 0:
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Peter Bergeron hit a two-run double and Chris
Widger had a pair of run-scoring singles. Winner Javier Vazquez
allowed three hits in five innings, and struck out four.
Rangers 7, Cardinals 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Arlington, Texas, Ivan Rodriguez said his bruised right elbow
was fine, then proved it by going 3-for-3 with a home run. The
reigning AL MVP was drilled by a pitch Thursday night in a game
against Double-A Tulsa. Once learning X-rays were negative,
Rodriguez wasted no time getting back behind the plate.
Tigers 5, Devil Rays 2:
</P>
<P>
   At St. Petersburg, Fla., Brian Moehler allowed two runs and four
hits in six innings and Juan Gonzalez went 1-for-4 after sitting
out Thursday's game with a sore right hamstring.
Astros 6, Yankees 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Houston, New York's Ricky Ledee homered for the second
straight day at Enron Field, but Lance Berkman gave Houston its
second straight win in its new stadium with a ninth-inning homer.
Diamondbacks 14, Red Sox 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Phoenix, Lenny Harris, the leading candidate to replace
injured Matt Williams at third base, was 2-for-3 with a double and
an RBI.
Angels 6, Padres 4, 10 innings:
</P>
<P>
   At Anaheim, Calif., Garret Anderson hit a two-run homer in the
10th inning as Anaheim won its fourth straight.
Phillies 1, Rockies 0:
</P>
<P>
   At Las Vegas, Paul Byrd allowed two hits in five scoreless
innings and scored the only run on Bobby Abreu's RBI single.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Sixty-two games have come and gone, five
rounds of play are in the books.
</P>
<P>
   Just two teams remain in the NCAA women's basketball tournament,
and to no one's surprise, they are top-ranked Connecticut and No. 2
Tennessee. The Philly final that most everyone expected is here at
last.
</P>
<P>
   The two giants of their sport will square off Sunday night in
the national championship game, their third meeting this season and
the second time they have played for the NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   Those who played it safe with their brackets got this one right.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody has been waiting for this game,''
Connecticut's Shea Ralph said. ''It's definitely fate. It's going
to be a big battle. We've prepared, we've worked hard and we're
ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut (35-1) and Tennessee (33-3) most assuredly have been
waiting for this chance.
</P>
<P>
   UConn, which beat Penn State 89-67 in Friday night's semifinals,
has not been to the championship game since it beat Tennessee 70-63
to win its only title in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, a 64-54 winner over Rutgers, won three straight
titles from 1996-98. But coach Pat Summitt's team didn't even get
to the Final Four last year, losing to Duke in the regional final.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was saying to Pat Summitt the other day, you know, years
like last year when they have the best team and they don't get
here, I think God does that to you to make you appreciate the years
you do get there even more,'' UConn coach Geno Auriemma said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One little thing can go wrong and you don't make it. Being
good is not good enough. So the fact that we are good enough and
fortunate enough to be here, I think we cherish this as much as
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies and Lady Vols split their regular-season games, each
winning on the other's court. Both have All-Americans and both have
talent that extends deep into their benches. Any one of several
players is capable of a big night. In the semifinals, it was the
point guards.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's Sue Bird and Tennessee's Kara Lawson both scored
19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson helped Tennessee crack Rutgers' baffling matchup zone in
the second half after the Scarlet Knights (26-8) stymied the Lady
Vols for much of the game. Bird went 5-for-7 on 3-point shots, had
five assists and did not commit a turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has been the MVP of our team this year,'' Ralph said.
''She has taken us for a wild ride in the tournament and every time
we need to step up, she takes our team where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut showed off its stunning depth in beating the Lady
Lions (30-5), who were in their first Final Four. Ralph a
first-team All-American, scored only nine points. Svetlana
Abrosimova, another first-team All-American, scored 14 but made
only 4-of-12 shots.
</P>
<P>
   That did not slow the Huskies in the least. Reserve Ashja Jones
scored 16 points and Tamika Williams came off the bench to get 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got contributions from everybody,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Garner led Penn State with 19 points and Lisa Shepherd
scored 15. Connecticut alternated defenders on point guard Helen
Darling, the Big Ten's player of the year, and held her scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just an off night for me,'' Darling said. ''There was
nothing I could do about it but continue to play hard. I think
that's what I did, try to pick it up defensively and create some
turnovers. Offensively, I wasn't playing well. You have those
nights sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers did what it had to do against Tennessee, which was pin
the Lady Vols in a halfcourt game with its pesky defense and
patience on offense. For the longest time, Tennessee couldn't find
an open spot anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lawson took charge by driving right into the teeth of the
defense. She had two key baskets and national player of the year
Tamika Catchings scored five points as Tennessee broke a 36-36 tie
with a 13-3 run and led the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think in the first half we really played on our heels and we
weren't in the attack mode,'' Lawson said. ''We let Rutgers dictate
how we were going to play offensively. So in the second half, we
really wanted to push tempo and try to put them on their heels.''
</P>
<P>
   Catchings finished with 13 points and 12 rebounds after scoring
just two points in the first half. Michelle Snow added 10 points
and blocked seven shots, a Final Four record.
</P>
<P>
   Shawnetta Stewart, Tasha Pointer and Linda Miles each scored 11
points for Rutgers, which has advanced farther in the tournament
each succeeding year in the past three. But it was small
consolation for coach Vivian Stringer, who spent 12 years at nearby
Cheyney State.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am impatient because I just don't believe we have to go
through those steps,'' Stringer said. ''I just felt like this was
the moment, this was the time.''

<HEADLINE> Disoriented Pilot Blamed for Crash  </HEADLINE>
By TOM PARSONS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- The Air Force has determined that the
deaths of three U.S. servicemen during the aborted landing of a
C-130 transport in Kuwait last year stemmed from pilot and crew
error.
</P>
<P>
   The air crew failed to follow procedures and made an improper
approach to a runway, according to Col. Frank Laras. The pilot also
didn't keep an eye on instruments and became disoriented, not
realizing how close the plane was to the ground or how far it was
from the runway at Al Jaber Air Base southwest of Kuwait City, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, yes, he flew the plane into the ground,'' said
Laras, who headed the Air Force investigation of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The plane hit the ground, breaking its landing gear, then flew
back into the air and made an emergency landing without landing
gear on a foam-covered runway at nearby Kuwait International
Airport, Laras said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot and three other crew members could face disciplinary
action by the Air Force, according to Col. Joseph Heimann, a lawyer
with the Air Mobility Command. No decision on that has been made,
he added
</P>
<P>
   The flight engineer has been cleared to resume flying, Laras
said, but the other three remain grounded, performing other duties
at Little Rock Air Force, officials said, pending a decision on
disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, assigned to the 61st Airlift Squadron at the air base
here, was ferrying 86 military passengers the 23 miles from Kuwait
International Airport to Al Jaber before dawn on Dec. 10. Three
passengers were killed when shafts that raise and lower the plane's
main landing gear -- four wheels in the middle of the fuselage --
broke from the impact with the ground and penetrated the plane's
metal skin, according to Laras' report. Also penetrating the
plane's skin, Laras said, were structural beams to which the
landing gear assemblies were attached.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other passengers were injured, two of them critically, the
report said. The two badly injured airmen are expected to recover
completely.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Hate Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A man who randomly assaulted a woman on the
street has been sentenced to six years in prison in the first case
of its kind to be prosecuted as a hate crime in California.
</P>
<P>
   A jury on Thursday found that the Aug. 1 attack was motivated by
Billy McCall's hatred of women, which added two years to his
sentence. The victim had been tackled from behind and hit her head
on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The case was the first time the state's hate crime law has been
used to prosecute an offense motivated by the victim's gender. Hate
crime laws usually are applied in cases involving crimes motivated
by race, ethnicity or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, 29, was convicted March 2. His attorney, Karolyn Kovtun,
said an appeal has been filed challenging the use of the hate crime
law.

<HEADLINE> NYPD has released sealed records before, Safir says  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It had been done before, with no public outcry.
</P>
<P>
   So hours after Patrick Dorismond was fatally shot by police,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir decided
to release the unarmed man's sealed records because of past
experience. In three other cases involving people killed by cops,
those sealed records were unveiled, Safir testified Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''When considering whether to release Mr. (Patrick) Dorismond's
records, it was our understanding that disclosure of the sealed
records was lawful, since the records related to a deceased person
and therefore the records were no longer subject to the sealing
statutes,'' Safir said to the state Assembly committees on codes,
judiciary and children and families at the hearing held at John Jay
College of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts challenged that stance, saying a person's death
did not break the seal on closed records.
</P>
<P>
   Safir seemed perplexed over the amount of attention focused on
Dorismond's records.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the other three cases passed without comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said he released sealed records in another case, and his
predecessor, William Bratton, disclosed records in two other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone, Bratton said he did not have a ''specific
recollection'' of whether or not he released such records.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not saying that it did not occur, and I'm trying to
determine if it did,'' Bratton said, adding that he had placed
telephone calls with his former NYPD staff members to find out. He
did not expect the information to be available on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing focused on the legality of releasing sealed juvenile
records. Hours after Patrick Dorismond was fatally shot by an
undercover detective in Manhattan on March 16, Safir -- with
Giuliani's permission -- told reporters of Dorismond's criminal
history. The 26-year-old was arrested for robbery at age 13 and had
adult arrests for gun possession and assault.
</P>
<P>
   The juvenile case was dismissed and the record sealed; in the
other two cases, Dorismond pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of Dorismond's juvenile record outraged his
family, some lawmakers and community residents, and Giuliani and
Safir have been criticized heavily. Public Advocate Mark Green has
obtained a court order seeking a judicial inquiry into the matter.
And on Thursday, a group of clergy members abruptly ended a meeting
with Safir to discuss police and community relations when the
commissioner refused to apologize for releasing Dorismond's record.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani apparently has reached out to another religious
leader. Giuliani met with The Rev. Michel Faulkner at Gracie
Mansion, the New York Daily News reported Friday. In the Thursday
night meeting, Faulkner, a longtime Giuliani backer who recently
condemned the mayor's handling of the Dorismond case, prayed with
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was reaching out to ''leaders from the
African-American, Haitian community,'' a mayoral aide told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Safir, along with Michael Hess, head of the city's Law
Department, were grilled by Assembly members over their
interpretation of the Family Court Act. The law states that
juvenile records are sealed and not made available to any person or
private agency. The law does not address the issue of what happens
to the records when a person dies. And that's where the dispute is.
</P>
<P>
   The law expires when someone dies, Hess and Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statute is designed to protect the interests only of the
living,'' Hess said. ''There is no legal basis to apply them to a
deceased person.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts who testified disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never heard of a sealed court record in any court being
unsealed or released without a court order,'' said Merrill Sobie, a
professor at Pace University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statute says the record is sealed, period,'' said Monroe
Freedman, a professor at Hofstra Law School. ''Maybe it should be
amended to say: And Mr. Hess, we really mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Safir, Dorismond's death was investigated by an
NYPD ''shooting team.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Dorismond case, the shooting team checked (police)
department systems and learned of two adult arrests and one
juvenile arrest for the decedent,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not ask state court officials or Hess's office for
the records, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The information was then given to Safir in a memo, who then
verbally told Giuliani of Dorismond's record, the commissioner
said. The two then discussed if the record should be disclosed and
decided to do so. Hess was not consulted until after the record was
unsealed.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner also said releasing such information is a
''very rare exception,'' and to his knowledge, has only been done
three other times in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said in April 1997, he released the sealed juvenile record
of 16-year-old Kevin Cedeno, who was fatally shot by police. At the
time of the shooting, Cedeno was on probation for armed robbery,
Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   And when Bratton was commissioner, sealed records were disclosed
after Ernest Sayon, 22, and Anthony Rosario, 18, were fatally shot
by police, Safir said. Sayon was killed in April 1994, Rosario in
January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Safir stood by his reasoning for releasing the records -- to
present all the facts of the shooting to quell any potential
unrest. He disagreed with critics who said the detective who shot
Dorismond did not know about the man's juvenile record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though the officer was unaware of any arrest record that
night, a person's prior actions can illuminate his or her
personality and help to explain behavior that might otherwise be
inexplicable, and thereby serve to ameliorate what might become an
incident jeopardizing the safety of the public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul N. Samuels, president of the Legal Action Center in
Manhattan, said the sealing of juvenile records is necessary to
help juvenile delinquents become productive members of society.
</P>
<P>
   ''They make the mistake when they're young,'' Samuels said.
''Unsealing the records does not help them when they've turned
their lives around.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Workers Adjust After Tornadoes  </HEADLINE>
By MATT SLAGLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Warren Gould still shows up for work at
his law firm on the fifth floor of the Cash America International
building in downtown Fort Worth, even though his office there no
longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   With help from his wife, Sandra, and seven co-workers, Gould now
spends his days wearing a hardhat and gardening gloves instead of a
business suit, plying through piles of glass rather than legal
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The office is in shambles: There aren't any windows, soggy
ceiling tiles litter the floor and tendrils of wire snake in all
directions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, my computer! I think. I'll bet it is,'' Gould said on
Friday as he hoisted the dented beige computer case. ''Well, I
don't know what it is, but it's close.''
</P>
<P>
   He is among thousands of workers in the city's central business
district displaced after a pair of deadly twisters wove their way
through the area Tuesday evening. One struck Fort Worth. The other
hit neighboring Arlington and then Grand Prairie. Four people were
killed and another is presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance adjusters estimate damage to Tarrant County -- where
Fort Worth and Arlington are -- at $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   Seven hundred out of 3,000 Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce
members will require some sort of assistance -- from new office
space and cleanup services, to computers and telephone equipment,
agency spokeswoman Netty Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Computers are probably one of the biggest things,'' she said.
''They need to get data removed from their computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould spent the day sorting through books, financial documents
and case files, loading them into green plastic bins and hauling
down the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't know what you're looking for. The things that you
couldn't live without all of a sudden become things you wonder why
you ever needed,'' said Gould, who estimated damage to the office
at $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   American International officials said it could take six months
to make repairs to the building.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush has declared Tarrant County a disaster area,
and damage assessment teams from the Federal Emergency Management
and the Small Business Administration arrived Friday to help state
leaders prepare paperwork for federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County College has made computers, meeting rooms and
Internet connections available to companies on a first-come,
first-serve basis, said spokeswoman Linda Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just kind of feel sorry for them,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Arrests at Black College Reunion  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- While thousands of young men and
women descended on this beach community for Black College Reunion,
local businesses were being monitored for signs of discrimination
against guests.
</P>
<P>
   As the weekend festivities began, police said at least 60 people
were arrested, most for minor infractions such as drug possession
or disorderly conduct. One person was cut with a knife and required
stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''The arrests that have been made have been for relatively minor
things,'' Volusia County Sheriff Bob Vogel said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal officials and members of the local chapter of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
scrutinized the Adam's Mark, the area's largest hotel which was
accused of discriminating against black guests during last year's
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel chain recently settled for $8 million two lawsuits
brought by the Justice Department and five former guests and
promised to revise its policies.
</P>
<P>
   Most noticeably, black hotel guests this year weren't required
to wear orange wristbands as they were last year.
</P>
<P>
   Guests were required to pay for their rooms in advance and leave
a $50 deposit to use their room's telephone and snack bar. Adam's
Mark officials said similar conditions are placed on visitors
during other special events, such as spring break.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing that we are doing at this hotel that is out
of the ordinary or that is in any sense racially motivated,'' said
Fred S. Kummer III, Adam's Mark's vice president of corporate
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stephanie Perry, 30, of Lakeland, said the heavy police
presence at the hotel and a written code of conduct passed out to
guests upon check-in were unique to Black College Reunion and she
hadn't seen them other times she was at the hotel. The code of
conduct put out by the city warns against public nudity and
carrying undomesticated animals, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are little differences you notice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel officials said they must balance the safety of the guests
while not appearing to target Black College Reunion. The
16-year-old event is known for clogging beachside traffic and
complaints of lewdness.

<HEADLINE> Md. House Panel Approves Gun Bill  </HEADLINE>
By SETH HETTENA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- House Republicans tried unsuccessfully to
sink a bill that would make Maryland the first state in the nation
to require built-in locks on handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial measure on Friday breezed through a House
committee, 14-7, with members not changing so much as a comma. The
bill would affect all new handguns sold in Maryland beginning in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tried nine times Friday night to amend the bill,
which would have sent the measure back to the Senate, where
opponents might have been able to kill it with a filibuster. But
the six Republicans and a lone Democrat who opposed the bill were
easily outnumbered by the rest of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the bill was flawed, pointing out that the
definition of a built-in gun lock was so vague that the safety
levers already found on most firearms would qualify. Some
supporters agreed, but said there was not enough time to fix the
problems, with little more than a week remaining in the 2000
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which has already passed the Senate, is up for a
vote before the full House as early as Monday. If it passes without
amendments, the bill goes to the desk of Democratic Gov. Parris
Glendening, who is eager to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are making history in the state of Maryland,'' Glendening
said after the vote. He said the vote sent a strong message:
''Maryland will stand up to the NRA, Maryland will do what is
necessary to protect our children, Maryland will make our
communities safer and Maryland will set a new, national standard
for gun safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the bill prohibits anyone convicted of a
violent crime as a juvenile from possessing a handgun until age 30
and requires gun manufacturers to provide a ballistic fingerprint
of shell casings of all new guns. It also imposes five-year
mandatory minimum sentences on some convicted felons caught with a
handgun.

<HEADLINE> Man Stowed Away Aboard Flight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A man traveled more than 2,000 miles to Memphis,
Tenn., while hiding in the cargo hold of a Northwest Airlines
flight.
</P>
<P>
   The stowaway settled into the heated and pressurized front
section of the cargo hold, where pets are kept, as Flight 946 left
Seattle on Friday morning, KIRO-TV reported.
</P>
<P>
   On arrival in Memphis, he asked baggage handlers for a ride to
the terminal, KIRO reported. When the handlers challenged him, he
fled.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't anticipate that there will be a person when you open
the cargo door,'' said Kathy Peach, a Minneapolis-based Northwest
spokeswoman. She said the man appeared to be in his late 20s. His
identity is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration and Seattle port police were
investigating, said Scott Ingham, a Northwest spokesman in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA here referred questions to a suburban Atlanta facility,
where a person who answered the phone Friday evening said FAA
involvement was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Port of Seattle, which operates the
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, said how the man got to the
plane is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very interested in learning how this individual got onto
the airfield,'' spokesman Bob Parker said.

<HEADLINE> Philly Mob Hit by Indictments  </HEADLINE>
By RON TODT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After years of infighting and prosecutions,
the Philadelphia mob may have been dealt its final blow.
</P>
<P>
   Its reputed boss and 10 others on Friday were indicted on
charges of murder, racketeering, extortion and gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot overstate the significance of this case,'' said U.S.
Attorney Michael Stiles. ''Not only does it reach to the highest
levels of organized crime, significant evidence comes from the
highest levels of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''That in my judgment represents a complete collapse of this
criminal organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Joseph ''Skinny Joey'' Merlino and 10 others
was aided by jailed former mob boss Ralph Natale, who has been
cooperating with authorities since the summer. Natale, the
highest-ranking American Mafia figure to flip sides, allegedly
appointed Merlino as his successor in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are accused of three murders and an attempted
murder. They also allegedly operated a protection racket that
preyed on bookmakers, numbers operators, video poker machine
operators and others in Philadelphia and southern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is a mob operating in Philadelphia, it's on its last
legs,'' said Fred Martens, former executive director of the
now-defunct Pennsylvania Crime Commission. ''The federal government
has decimated the mob in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Merlino already is jailed on drug charges. Of the others, eight
were arrested Friday, and two were arrested earlier and freed on
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino and three others could face the death penalty if federal
prosecutors decided to seek it, Stiles said.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino attorney Joseph Santaguida said his client denied all
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia mob has declined since the 1960s and 1970s,
when Angelo Bruno ruled with a firm hand. Since Bruno was gunned
down in a car in front of his home in 1980, his successors have
been taken down, one by one, by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, a federal jury convicted then-boss ''Little Nicky''
Scarfo and 16 associates on racketeering charges. John Stanfa took
over in 1990 but was found guilty of racketeering with seven others
in 1995. Natale then took over, appointing Merlino as underboss.

<HEADLINE> Report: Burns To Buy JFK Jr. Loft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Actor Edward Burns has negotiated a deal to buy
John F. Kennedy Jr.'s loft apartment in the trendy TriBeCa
neighborhood, the Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who has appeared in such films as ''Saving Private Ryan''
and ''She's The One,'' negotiated a bid less than the reported
minimum $2.5 million asking price, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,400-square-foot loft, in a nondescript former commercial
building, has been on the market via sealed bids by Sotheby's
International Realty. Kennedy paid $700,000 for the loft in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, a native of Long Island, still must receive approval from
the property's co-op board.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Sotheby's realty declined comment to the Daily
News. Mara Buxbaum, Burns' publicist, said the actor had no
comment.
</P>
<P>
   TriBeCa -- the nickname comes from the phrase ''triangle below
Canal Street'' -- is a former industrial area of 19th century
warehouses, factories and lofts whose facades belie the luxury
conversions within. Actor Robert DeNiro and other notables live in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy; his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy; and her sister
Lauren Bessette were killed in July when the plane Kennedy was
piloting crashed off Martha's Vineyard.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Minimum Wage Takes Effect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- The Irish Republic's first national
minimum wage came into effect on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The new rate guarantees employees $5.32 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's deputy prime minister, Mary Harney, said the new
minimum wage would benefit more than 160,000 workers nationwide and
''end pay exploitation in the workplace once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It will protect workers who are vulnerable and prone to be
exploited, especially women and young people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent of the workers affected by the new minimum wage
will be women, and more than 40 percent will be under the age of
25, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the national wages agreement, the wage will
rise to $5.69 in July next year and $6.05 in October 2002.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Warns of Balkans War  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Another war in the Balkans provoked by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic is a good possibility unless the West
takes steps to stop him, the new Croatian president said in a
magazine interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milosevic is like a cyclist that can only keep going as long
as he is riding in the direction of war,'' Stipe Mesic told Der
Spiegel in an interview released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic were to take any action, for example against
Yugoslavia's junior republic Montenegro to keep it a part of the
country, NATO must ''give a very clear signal: 'Milosevic, when you
go into military action against Montenegro, your days are
numbered,''' Mesic said.
</P>
<P>
   Mesic also had strong words against former Croatian
authoritarian leader Franjo Tudjman, whose death made possible the
victory for reformist political forces earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milosevic doesn't know what Europe is, and Tudjman also didn't
know,'' Mesic said. Tudjman's ''thinking was in the middle ages,
exactly like Milosevic still today.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Find 32 Bodies  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUDERMES, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops today found one injured
survivor and the bodies of 32 servicemen who had been missing after
an ambush by rebels in Chechnya's mountains, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal forces have been sweeping the region of Vedeno, deep in
the southern mountains, for two days in a search for 39 of their
comrades missing after the ambush Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry press service said the 32 bodies and the
injured survivor were found not far from the site of the attack.
Six servicemen remained unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen bodies were recovered, but 13 others had to be left in
the field because they had been mined by rebels, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin spokesman for Chechnya, had
said Friday that 49 Interior Ministry troops were in the convoy
that was ambushed by Chechen rebels near the village of
Zhani-Vedeno, about four miles outside Vedeno. Four soldiers were
killed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush was the latest in a series of attacks demonstrating
Russian forces' vulnerability to the rebels even though they are
better-equipped and numerically superior.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ground forces entered Chechnya in late September and
have driven most rebels out of the flatlands and into the mountains
that make up the republic's southern third. The rebels are skilled
guerrilla fighters who use the rugged terrain of southern Chechnya
to their advantage, while Russian forces struggle to move their
heavy equipment in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   As the war drags on, international criticism of Russia's
offensive and alleged abuses by federal troops also continues.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has rejected the allegations, but in an apparent bow to
international pressure, the Kremlin invited the U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner, Mary Robinson, flew today to Ingushetia, a
region adjacent to Chechnya that has given shelter to most of the
250,000 refugees from the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's two-day tour of the region is expected to include a
visit Sunday to the Chernokozovo detention center in Chechnya,
where human rights groups say prisoners were routinely tortured.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is extremely important that serious allegations of human
rights violations are followed up and investigated,'' she said
after arriving in Moscow on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson visited refugee camps in Ingushetia today, where
authorities two days ago began serving hot meals for the first time
since February and began delivering bread to all officially
registered refugees in the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to international pressure, Russia has only recently
allowed international human rights officials to go to the Chechen
conflict zone.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson entered a tent at a refugee camp in the village of
Ordzhonikidzovskaya to ask about conditions there and whether it
was dangerous to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is impossible to return, everyone has lost their homes,
everyone had family members killed,'' Aza Yupayeva, a refugee from
the Chechen capital Grozny, said she told Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's visit and the agreement this week to allow the Red
Cross access to detention centers in Chechnya came just days before
an April 3-4 meeting of the Council of Europe, the continent's
leading human rights watchdog, on whether to suspend Russia for
abuses in Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> China National Theater Work Begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China began work on a futuristic and
controversial 6,200-seat national theater Saturday, 42 years after
then-Premier Zhou Enlai proposed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the titanium and glass domed building in a lake
in central Beijing is expected to take three years.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary work on the 2 million square-foot site, next to the
Great Hall of the People near Tiananmen Square, began on Saturday,
the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The building will contain four halls -- a 2,500-seat opera hall,
a concert hall with 2,000 seats, a theater with 1,200 seats and a
smaller theater that will seat 520.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will enter through a tunnel under the lake, which will
be surrounded by grass and trees.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have argued that the monument lacks Chinese
characteristics, is too expensive and too ostentatious.
</P>
<P>
   The theater is based on a design by French architect Paul Andreu
and Beijing's prestigious Qinghua University, Xinhua said. Andreu
helped build the Grande Arche de la Defense west of Paris and the
Channel Tunnel terminal in Calais.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Zhou first proposed a national theater in 1958. A huge
hole was dug, but work stopped because of financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Xinhua did not give a price tag for the theater. But the
government's share of the cost was announced previously at $314
million.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Protest Sale of Rover  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- Thousands filled the streets of this
central English city Saturday to protest German auto giant BMW's
decision to break up the loss-making Rover car group.
</P>
<P>
   The rally, part of a public campaign to save the 8,000 jobs at
Rover's main Longbridge plant in Birmingham, attracted about 40,000
people. More were expected throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders and lawmakers began gathering early, while crowds
of supporters filled the sidewalks waving banners and placards,
reading ''Betrayed,'' ''No Surrender'' and ''Save Rover. Save Us.''
</P>
<P>
   BMW announced its plan earlier this month to sell Rover to a
group of British venture capitalists, Alchemy. The group has no
experience with auto-making, and has acknowledged that job losses
are inevitable as the plant becomes a niche producer of sports cars
under the name MG Car Co. Ambitiously, Alchemy hopes to post a
profit within three years and sell the company within seven.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders fear that Rover will be allowed to die and
thousands of jobs will go. They have been trying desperately to
find another buyer for the car group, which lost $3.2 million a day
last year, but there has been little interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''The job losses that will result from the breakup of Rover are
a catastrophe for the whole British economy but worse for the West
Midlands'' where the main plant is located, said Roger Lyons,
general secretary of the Manufacturing Science and Finance union.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message we are sending back to BMW is that their conduct
will not be tolerated by the British people,'' said Duncan Simpson,
a union negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the breakup, BMW will sell the popular Land Rover
brand of off-road vehicles to Dearborn, Mich,-based Ford Motor Co.
for $2.9 billion.

<HEADLINE> G8 Education Summit Opens in Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Education ministers from the Group of Eight
countries gathered in Tokyo Saturday to open their first education
summit.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-day meeting, the ministers and representatives
from various international organizations will discuss international
exchanges in education and ways to deal with globalization and
information technology, officials from the Japanese Education
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the G-8 ministers, officials from the European
Union, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
and U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization are at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   They are expected to agree to double the number of exchange
students, teachers and researchers over the next 10 years, Kyodo
News agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening address, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi wished
success for the group's first education summit ''despite their
countries facing different problems on education,'' Kyodo quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   G-8 members are Japan, the United States, Britain, Germany,
France, Italy, Canada and Russia.

<HEADLINE> 5 Kids Dropped From Shooting Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- Five more students and the owner of a
handgun have been dropped from a lawsuit brought by the parents of
three girls gunned down in their high school lobby by a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Heath High School shooting victims Kayce Steger,
15, Jessica James, 17, and Nicole Hadley, 14, claimed the five
teen-agers knew Michael Carneal intended to take a gun to school
and shoot people but said nothing. They accused the owner of the
gun of negligence by not properly locking it up.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven students were shot, three fatally, when Carneal, then 14,
opened fire on a circle of students praying in the lobby Dec. 1,
1997. Carneal pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to life in
prison with no chance of parole for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Will Shadoan on Friday ruled that the five
students -- three of whom the parents claimed had been warned by
Carneal to stay away that day and two they said knew Carneal had a
gun -- may have had a moral duty to warn administrators but no legal
obligation to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Shadoan also dropped the case against Wendell Nace, ruling he
was not negligent for leaving a .22 pistol in a box in his locked
garage.
</P>
<P>
   Carneal and Nace's son found the gun while looking for tools and
Carneal later took it, according to Carneal's deposition.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing scheduled for June 2, Shadoan will be asked to
dismiss from the lawsuit six more students, accused of having
conspired with Carneal.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' parents originally named 53 defendants, but the
number was cut to 15 when Shadoan dismissed all teachers, school
officials and five students.
</P>
<P>
   Carneal and his parents are the other remaining defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The families were seeking $120 million in damages.

<HEADLINE> 4 Egyptian Journalists Face Fines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Four Egyptian journalists were convicted in
a retrial Saturday of libeling the deputy prime minister, a
decision that included heavy fines for all four and prison terms
for three.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists of the Islamic-oriented newspaper Al-Shaab were
convicted of libeling Deputy Prime Minister Youssef Waly in a
series of articles that had accused him of trying to ruin Egypt's
agricultural sector by cooperating with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo Criminal Court sentenced editor-in-chief Magdi Hussein
and reporter Salah Bdeiwi to two years in prison and cartoonist
Essam Hanafi to one year in prison. The three, plus reporter Adel
Hussein were also fined $5,800 apiece and ordered to pay $145
apiece to Waly in compensation, court officials said on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The four were convicted in August and three of them had served
part of their jail terms by December when an appeals court revoked
their sentences and ordered a retrial. The appeals court found that
the lower court judge had not allowed them enough time to defend
themselves and had rejected their demand for Waly to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The time that the three journalists have already served in
prison will be deducted from their new sentences.

<HEADLINE> Saudis Will Let UN Observe Courts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Responding to allegations that Saudi
police torture detainees and that defendants are convicted in
secret trials, Saudi Arabia has offered to allow the United Nations
to observe its justice system, a Foreign Ministry official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United Nation's special rapporteur on the independence of judges
and lawyers, Param Cumaraswamy, has been invited here to see how
the country's courts operate.
</P>
<P>
   He said Saudi Arabia had invited Cumaraswamy, a Malaysian jurist
with the United Nations in Geneva, so that he might correct
misconceptions concerning its human rights record and judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International released a report on Saudi Arabia this
week, saying it had documented patterns of systematic human rights
violations. The allegations included torture of detainees in many
Saudi police stations and prisons, and defendants being convicted
in trials conducted in secret.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Amnesty rejected a Saudi claim that the kingdom had
responded to such charges by providing information to the rights
watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   ''I challenge Saudi Arabia to produce the alleged responses,''
said a statement from William F. Shulz, executive director of
Amnesty International USA.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based daily Al-Hayat quoted an unnamed Saudi Foreign
Ministry official Friday as saying the kingdom had provided
detailed responses to Amnesty in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative kingdom, where women are not allowed to drive
and must be covered head-to-toe in public, follows a strict
interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia. Courts may hand down
sentences of amputation for thieves and public execution for
murderers, rapists, sodomites and drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, at least five people have had their hands or
feet amputated and at least 14 people have been beheaded.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations have often criticized the sentences,
saying defendants do not receive fair trials and often do not have
access to lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Poland Party Says it Owns Slogan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- A Polish political party said Saturday it
has exclusive rights to promote its candidate with the ''President
2000'' slogan -- and will sue anybody else who uses it in this
year's race.
</P>
<P>
   Stanislaw Michalkiewicz, one of the leaders of the rightist Unia
Polityki Realnej, or Union for Real Policy, said the party filed
for the trademark last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has not been registered yet, nevertheless it already
entitles us to exclusive use,'' Michalkiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Union, a staunch advocate of radical free market reforms,
did not gain any seats in the last parliamentary elections but
intends to put forward its candidate in the presidential race this
year. Janusz Korwin-Mikke, known for his sense of humor and desire
to reduce taxes to a bare minimum, has already run twice for
president without success.
</P>
<P>
   President Aleksander Kwasniewski, an ex-communist who leads
opinion polls with some 70 percent support, has said he will stand
for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Former president Lech Walesa, legendary founder of the
Solidarity movement that toppled communist rule, plans to challenge
Kwasniewski. Another candidate is centrist Andrzej Olechowski, who
has served as finance minister and foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential elections are scheduled for fall, but no specific
date has been set.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Kin Won't Give Boy to Dad  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's relatives here are fearful that an
entourage of classmates, doctors and other officials seeking
permission to travel to the United States with the boy's father
could cause more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   They no longer are willing to hand over the 6-year-old to his
father if he comes to Florida to await the outcome of their court
appeal to keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While Juan Miguel Gonzalez would be welcome to visit his son at
the Little Havana home of his Miami relatives, no Cuban officials
would be allowed past the front gate, said Eduardo Rasco, an
attorney representing Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly are vehemently opposed to allowing Juan Miguel to
come here, take the child and put him in isolation where they can
start indoctrinating him,'' Rasco said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, a Washington lawyer representing Elian's father,
said his client will travel to the United States as soon as he is
assured by the Immigration and Naturalization Service that he will
be given custody of his son. The lawyer said he also will seek
permission for the boy's classmates, teacher and doctors to travel
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, said the
strategy is ''harming'' talks with the INS, which have ended for
the week with no agreement. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were examining visa regulations to determine how
many of the 31 would-be companions would be able to join Elian's
father. There are strict eligibility limits for Cuban visas.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez has refused to sign a promise to officials of
the INS that he will surrender Elian if he and his family lose
their court battle.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to reach an agreement, the INS has threatened to revoke
the boy's residency status, but twice this week pushed back the
deadline, now set for 9 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, another attorney for the Miami relatives, said
officials would have to come to the Little Havana house to get
Elian, but relatives would not resist if they tried to take the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official said Friday that Juan Miguel
Gonzalez will probably be given custody of Elian if he comes to the
United States, though the official also said it is uncertain
whether that would happen right away.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Elian's father comes to this country, it's likely we will
transfer custody of Elian to him. This is consistent with our goal
of reuniting them, which was upheld by the district court,'' the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The father has requested a visa to come to the United States for
as long as it takes to complete the court case. A federal appeals
court in Atlanta has scheduled arguments for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Elian spent Friday with a teacher who has been home-schooling
him. His relatives have said they were keeping Elian home out of
fear he could be taken away while in school.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently was unaware of the two dozen demonstrators outside
who stood for hours in the 90 degree heat, some holding signs, as
the Cuban national anthem played on a sound system.
</P>
<P>
   The day ended with six of Elian's supporters pitching an
overhead tent and declaring themselves on a hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to stand with the boy,'' said K.A. Paul, one of
the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   Four protesters remained Saturday morning while Elian played
with a white rabbit in the family's yard.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the center of an international custody battle
since November, when he was rescued from waters off the Florida
Coast. His mother and 10 others died when their boat sank en route
to the United States from Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Black College Reunion Kicks Off  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- While thousands of young men and
women descended on this beach community for Black College Reunion,
local businesses were being monitored for signs of discrimination
against guests.
</P>
<P>
   As the weekend festivities got underway, police said at least
183 people were arrested, most for minor infractions such as drug
possession or disorderly conduct. One person was cut with a knife
and required stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''The arrests that have been made have been for relatively minor
things,'' said Volusia County Sheriff Bob Vogel.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal officials and members of the local chapter of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
scrutinized the Adam's Mark, the area's largest hotel which was
accused of discriminating against black guests during last year's
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel chain recently settled for $8 million two lawsuits
brought by the Justice Department and five former guests and
promised to revise its policies.
</P>
<P>
   Most noticeably, black hotel guests this year weren't required
to wear orange wristbands as they were last year.
</P>
<P>
   Guests were required to pay for their rooms in advance and leave
a $50 deposit to use their room's telephone and snack bar. Adam's
Mark officials said similar conditions are placed on visitors
during other special events, such as spring break.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing that we are doing at this hotel that is out
of the ordinary or that is in any sense racially motivated,'' said
Fred S. Kummer III, Adam's Mark's vice president of corporate
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stephanie Perry, 30, of Lakeland, said the heavy police
presence at the hotel and a written code of conduct passed out to
guests upon check-in were unique to Black College Reunion and she
hadn't seen them other times she was at the hotel. The code of
conduct put out by the city warns against public nudity and
carrying undomesticated animals, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are little differences you notice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel officials said they must balance the safety of the guests
while not appearing to target Black College Reunion. The
16-year-old event is known for clogging beachside traffic and
complaints of lewdness.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Workers Plan Criticized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- Criticism intensified Saturday over
a controversial campaign slogan against bringing foreign workers to
help Germany's high-tech industry, with church and business leaders
condemning the Christian Democrats' tactics in a state election.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Ruettgers, the gubernatorial candidate for the
conservatives in North Rhine-Westphalia state, has criticized a
plan by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to offer work permits to
20,000 computer specialists to ease what German businesses complain
is a serious shortfall of qualified workers.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives insist that Germany must curb an influx of
immigrants, especially considering its own 11 percent unemployment
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers has turned the plan into a campaign issue, attacking
it with the slogan ''Kinder statt Inder,'' or ''children instead of
Indians.'' He has also said the party would be putting up posters
and sending out 100,000 postcards with the motto ''more training
instead of more immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the head of Germany's Lutheran Church, Manfred
Kock, called for an immigration policy that also considers the
human side of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''The connection between an election battle and such a
foreigner-hostile, populistic campaign is unspeakable and should
not happen,'' Kock said.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Association of German Industries, Hans-Olaf
Henkel, called on voters that receive the campaign postcards to
throw them in the trash.
</P>
<P>
   ''Germany cannot afford this kind of provincialism,'' Henkel
told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Friedman, a vice president of the Central Council of Jews
in Germany and also a Christian Democrat party member, told the
Berliner Zeitung the Ruettger campaign was ''counter-productive and
archaic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Christian Democratic Secretary-General Angela Merkel, to
be appointed the party's head at a convention this month, defended
the campaign. She said the goal of the slogan was to spur more
discussion about immigration -- and not to misuse the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a European solution,'' she said at a state party
meeting in Saxony-Anhalt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of neo-Nazis in Germany is continuing to
rise, according to a report in the mass-circulation Bild newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a government report to be released next week, Bild said
that there was an 11 percent increase to about 53,600 members of
114 known far-right groups. The number of those believed to be
capable of violence rose 9 percent to about 8,200 people.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans will begin moving
legislation this week intended to better protect sensitive tax
information and provide breaks on tax interest and penalties, a top
GOP lawmaker said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the old saying goes, there's nothing certain but death and
taxes. We can't do anything about death, but we can and should make
taxes as fair and easy as possible,'' said Rep. Bill Archer,
chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the weekly Republican radio address, Archer also announced
that the committee plans three days of hearings, beginning April
11, to examine proposals to replace the current tax code with a
national sales tax, a flat tax or some other system.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tax code is too complicated and confusing, and we'd like
to do more to get the IRS out of the lives of American taxpayers,''
said Archer, R-Texas. ''In the meantime, we need to make sure the
current system treats taxpayers fairly, while protecting their
rights and privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' new taxpayer rights bill is timed to coincide
with the final weeks of federal income tax filing season and would
build on legislation passed in 1998 as part of the Internal Revenue
Service reform law.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, that law forced the IRS to shift its focus
toward taxpayer satisfaction, gave people new ways to protect homes
from seizure in tax disputes and improved laws protecting innocent
spouses from responsibility for their partner's tax misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the Clinton
administration will work with the Republicans toward providing more
rights for the taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we have concerns about some of Chairman Archer's
suggestions, we agree with many of them,'' Summers said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said the administration feels the most important objectives
of tax law deal with helping taxpayers through ''key moments of
their lives,'' such as home buying, educating their children and
preparing for retirement. He said President Clinton's proposals
would meet these goals.
</P>
<P>
   But, Summers said, ''We are committed to strengthening taxpayer
rights, and we will continue to work with Congress and the IRS to
ensure that taxpayers receive the best service possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer said the Ways and Means Committee is to vote on the new
measure Wednesday. Cost estimates were incomplete, but aides said
it would run several billion dollars over 10 years and would be
paid for with projected budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   To safeguard taxpayer data from computer hackers or other
improper use, the legislation would:
</P>
<P>
   --Toughen consent requirements for access to tax information by
financial institutions. Lenders would have to verify that a consent
form was completed and dated and certify that all information would
be kept confidential. Institutions failing to comply could face
perjury penalties.
</P>
<P>
   --Prevent IRS agents, during an audit, from examining tax returns
of a taxpayer's representative, such as an attorney or accountant,
just because that professional was representing the person being
audited.
</P>
<P>
   --Require states that have access to federal tax data to conduct
annual systems reviews to prevent access by hackers or other
illegal disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   --Require that IRS notify taxpayers immediately if their
information is illegally obtained.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taxpayer information is some of the most sacred information we
entrust to government,'' Archer said. ''We can never be too
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would make several changes in the way the IRS assesses
interest and penalties. Taxpayers frequently complain about IRS
acts such as charging interest for late payment of taxes to a
taxpayer who relied on IRS advice in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP legislation would:
</P>
<P>
   --Repeal the penalty for failure to pay taxes but maintain the
current penalty for failure to file. If the taxpayer has not gotten
an installment agreement from the IRS within four months, a 5
percent late payment charge would apply.
</P>
<P>
   --End the current practice of taxing as income interest paid by
the IRS to a taxpayer, affecting an estimated 10 million taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   --Waive penalty interest if the IRS makes a mistake or causes an
unreasonable delay or if the delay was caused by written IRS advice
to a taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   --Stop IRS interest from building up while a taxpayer works out a
dispute with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would simplify the way people make estimated
tax payments, quicken the pace of IRS decisions on organizations
seeking tax-exempt status and require the Treasury Department to
report on the 10 most common complaints of IRS employee misconduct.

<HEADLINE> Japan Coalition Dumps Junior Member  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's ruling coalition ejected a junior partner
on Saturday in a move that still leaves Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
firmly in control.
</P>
<P>
   ''We couldn't agree on a common future vision for governing, so
it became clear it was impossible to continue in the tripartite
coalition,'' the Kyodo News agency quoted Obuchi as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party notified the Liberal Party
that their partnership is over, Kyodo reported, quoting the chief
Cabinet spokesman, Mikio Aoki.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty LDP and the New Komeito, a party affiliated with a
lay Buddhist organization, will govern alone. An election in the
powerful lower house of parliament must be held by October.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the Liberal Party and the LDP were rocky from
the start of their alliance in October, with Liberal chief Ichiro
Ozawa often threatening to walk out over policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ozawa denied late Saturday that the coalition had fallen
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ''No conclusion has been reached,'' he was quoted as saying by
Kyodo after meeting with the leaders of the other two parties.
</P>
<P>
   In January, in a display of disharmony unusual in Japanese
politics, the coalition forced passage of a bill that reduces the
number of proportionately chosen seats in the lower house -- at the
insistence of the Liberals and over the objections of the New
Komeito and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the coalition passed a record spending plan
meant to spend Japan out of its worst economic slump since World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa is likely to continue pushing Obuchi by demanding, for
example, reform of a police force mired in scandals involving
drugs, sexual misconduct and hazing, said Shigenori Okazaki, a
political analyst at Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Liberals will start attacking the coalition, and they are
very good at that,'' Okazaki said.

<HEADLINE> Rwandans Mourn Genocide Victims  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Rwanda began a week of mourning Saturday,
six years after a 90-day frenzy of killing and brutality that left
more than half a million people dead and tore apart this Central
African nation.
</P>
<P>
   State-run Radio Rwanda, the only national broadcaster, called on
listeners to mark the event with public discussions and
remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus
were killed in the 1994 genocide, most slaughtered with machetes,
hoes and other makeshift weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The week of mourning, during which bars and discos were to be
closed, will culminate in a ceremony Friday -- the anniversary of
the beginning of the slaughter -- in the Kigali neighborhood of
Kicukiro, where the remains of Tutsis who were hacked to death and
buried in a mass grave will be excavated and given proper burial.
</P>
<P>
   After rebels of the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front took power
and ended the slaughter in July 1994, the dead were buried quickly
in mass graves to avoid infection and disease, often without proper
identification or the knowledge of their relatives. A reburial
ceremony has taken place each year since 1994 in a different part
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The killings began on April 7, 1994, the day after the plane
carrying ethnic Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana was shot down by
unidentified attackers on its approach to Kigali airport.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the president's death enraged Hutu soldiers and
militiamen, who hunted down Tutsi men, women and children and
killed them on the spot, usually with machetes. Civilians also
participated in the killings. At the time, all Rwandans carried
identification cards stating whether they were Hutu, Tutsi or Twa.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda blames the United Nations for failing to prevent or deter
the killings. As soon as the massacres started, the U.N. pulled out
most of its peacekeepers, who had been sent to Rwanda to monitor a
1993 peace agreement between Habyarimana's government and the
Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In Kicukiro, at least 2,000 Tutsis sought shelter at a high
school under the protection of a small company of Belgian U.N.
peacekeepers. But the peacekeepers eventually left, saying they
could no longer offer protection. The Tutsis were left to their
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Belgian peacekeepers were slain by government soldiers on
the night of April 6 while trying to protect Prime Minister Agathe
Uwilingiyimana, a moderate Hutu who was dragged from her house and
killed by members of Habyarimana's presidential guard.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the families of the slain Belgians are expected in
Kigali on Friday to attend the ceremony, together with Belgian
Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt and Foreign Minister Louis Michel.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Oil Industry, Help Each Other  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HOLMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The oil business has been good to George W.
Bush, and in 1999 the Texas governor was good to the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   The first major bill Bush signed during Texas' most recent
legislative session was a $45 million tax break for small oil and
natural gas producers. The bill's numerous, bipartisan supporters
said the help was needed to keep small producers pumping under what
then were low crude-oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are tough times for the oil and gas industry, and this
legislation says our state is committed to helping this vital
industry,'' Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee,
said in signing the bill last March.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with oil prices now soaring, Bush has said he is
considering endorsing suspension of a 4.3 cent-per-gallon federal
gasoline tax hike that was approved as part of President Clinton's
1993 economic recovery plan. Congressional Republicans call it the
''Gore tax,'' because the vice president cast the deciding vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Senate already is considering suspension of
the tax increase but has put off action on a rollback bill until
this coming week. But the measure uncertain prospects in the House,
and even proponents admit a rollback would offer modest relief for
motorists at best.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the Clinton administration should be blamed for prices
averaging well over $1.50 per gallon because it squandered the
goodwill built with oil producers by his father, former President
Bush, in the Persian Gulf War and because it lacks an overall
energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Bush said he would urge Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
Mexico to ''open the spigots'' and would remind them of the U.S.
role in the 1991 war and of its economic bailout of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of opponents to the Texas tax-break bill protested
that it provided corporate welfare to oil companies while offering
little long-term relief to the industry. They said other businesses
suffered economic downturns without eliciting similar help.
</P>
<P>
   Noting efforts to hold down spending elsewhere, Bruce Buchanan,
a political scientist at the University of Texas, said of Bush:
''He's got a tender spot for (oilmen) that's not apparent in some
other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Bush began his business career in the West
Texas oil fields, and he has received substantial support from the
industry since entering politics in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of his fund raising by the campaign finance group
Texans for Public Justice found that $5.6 million of the $41
million Bush raised for his two gubernatorial races came from the
energy and natural resources industries.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been friendly to that sector, policy-wise, and they've
been good to him in return,'' said Craig McDonald, director of the
group. ''He rewarded them with tax breaks when they cried that they
weren't making enough money.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing Bush's presidential campaign finance reports, the
Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics ranked oil and gas
eighth among top industries giving to Bush, accounting for $1.42
million thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said there was no
connection between political contributions and Bush's support for
the 1999 tax break.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor supported the legislation to help small,
independent oil producers, oil field workers and Texas families who
depend on the oil and gas sector. (They) were in a desperate
situation last year,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear Bush feels a kinship with those in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation from Yale and the Harvard Business School, Bush
returned to Midland, Texas, where his father had entered the oil
business after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Starting as a landman, who checks deeds and mineral rights, the
younger Bush founded an exploration firm in the 1970s that put
together private partnerships for drilling ventures. He named it
Arbusto, meaning ''bush'' in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   By 1982, Arbusto was on hard times. The company had less than
$50,000 in the bank and was about $420,000 in debt. Bush changed
the name to Bush Exploration Co. and took the business public.
</P>
<P>
   The company later merged, first with Spectrum 7 Energy Corp., a
firm of Cincinnati-based investors, and later with Harken Energy,
an Irving, Texas, corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his partners got $2 million in stock in the latter
merger, and he became a consultant and director of Harken. It was
during this time that Bush's business dealings came under increased
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   One incident involved a potentially lucrative offshore drilling
project awarded by the government of Bahrain in 1990 to Harken,
even though the company had never drilled a well in water.
</P>
<P>
   The news media questioned whether the Middle Eastern country was
trying to curry favor with Bush's father, then the president. The
younger Bush has said he had nothing to do with the Bahrain deal.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Bush sold almost two-thirds of his holdings,
or $840,000 in stock, at $4 a share. A week later the company
announced a major loss, and its stock closed down about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the sale as
possible insider trading but brought no action against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he sold the shares to repay a loan he had taken to
invest in the Texas Rangers baseball team in 1989. That $600,000
investment brought him about $14.9 million when the team was sold
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> S.Koreans Battle Animal Disease  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAJU, South Korea (AP) -- The roads to the demilitarized zone
north of Seoul, South Korea are usually guarded by tank traps and
military checkpoints to ferret out possible infiltrators from rival
communist North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   This week, South Korean soldiers and farmers armed with
fumigators were fighting the spread of a new adversary:
hoof-and-mouth disease.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, soldiers flagged down vehicles traveling in and out
of this low-lying farming town 30 miles north of Seoul. Each car
and truck was directed to roll slowly across thick spongy rugs
doused with chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Weary farmers kept 24-hour guard, blocking off the entrances to
their villages and washing down each car with a chemical solution
before letting it through. A gaggle of girls returning from school
dutifully stepped on the wet rugs and cleaned the soles of their
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   A contaminated village nearby was cordoned off Saturday. Plumes
of smoke spiraled in the clear blue sky as soldiers wearing
chemical warfare outfits trundled wheelbarrows full of hay out to a
burn site, destroying it in case it had come in contact with the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a life-or-death matter for us. Our whole livelihood
depends on it,'' said cattle farmer Yoo Chong-kyu, 40.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mad cow disease, which is believed to cause a
brain-wasting ailment in humans, hoof-and-mouth disease cannot be
passed on to consumers. But it can ruin entire beef and milk cow
herds. The highly contagious virus causes fever and blisters on the
feet and mouths, sapping animals' appetites and causing weight loss
and possibly death.
</P>
<P>
   The last outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease in Asia occurred in
Taiwan in 1997, when ranchers were forced to destroy 3.6 million
pigs -- more than 80 percent of the nation's hog population.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean scare began last week when 15 cows in Kumpa, a tiny
village surrounded by walnut tree-covered hills, collapsed with the
telltale fever and blisters. Health authorities moved in, burning
down barns and slaughtering all 105 head of cattle there.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea says it contained the disease at an early stage. But
as the United States, Japan, Australia and Taiwan moved to suspend
imports of South Korean dairy products, the government said Friday
it was willing to slaughter all 350,000 head of livestock within a
12-mile radius of the farms in Paju -- a $90 million cleanup
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The government plans to buy the meat of the slaughtered
livestock or reimburse farmers who have to sell their meat at lower
prices. The meat will be sold in domestic markets because it is not
infected, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The government took out ads telling people that the disease
cannot be transmitted to humans, and domestic consumption of beef
and pork began picking up after a sharp drop, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But farmers -- many of whom were devastated by the Asian
financial crisis and then by last year's heavy flooding -- did not
let their guard down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have all blocked entrances to our village, except the main
gateway. We stand guard 24 hours a day so that nobody gets in
unless we clean him up,'' said Chung Hwan-shik in Kekhyun, a
community two miles north of the contaminated village.

which features top-of-the-line models from 17 luxury manufacturers.
There is none of the high-pressure bustle that usually accompanies
trade fairs.
</P>
<P>
   Money talks. Wealth whispers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't just come here to drink champagne, we come here to
dialogue with each other, to place orders, to make Swiss
watchmaking work,'' said Franco Cologni, president of the
International Salon of Haute Horlogerie.
</P>
<P>
   But one Swiss watchmaker was noticeably absent: Swatch -- the
world's biggest watch company with $2.2 billion in 1999 revenue and
maker of what is said to be the most successful watch of all time --
had nothing on display.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Hayek, a marketing wizard whose plastic Swatch saved the
ailing Swiss industry in the 1980s, refused to stage an exhibit,
accusing organizers of elitism and setting difficult entry
conditions for Swiss companies -- while at the same time allowing in
foreign companies like London-based Alfred Dunhill.
</P>
<P>
   Other exhibitors -- including renowned names such as Audemars
Piguet, Baume and Mercier and Breguet -- had no such reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here with the top brands and we can meet up with the
world's top jewelers in the city which is the original home of top
watches,'' said Klaus-Juergen Schneider of Mont Blanc. ''It's THE
event of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider and other company executives attending the event,
which ends Tuesday, hope to woo customers from the Far East, the
United States and Brazil. Contacts made and contracts signed in
Geneva will account for at least 50 percent of annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   The mood is equally upbeat on the stand of Geneva watchmaker
Piaget, whose range includes the ''Ladies Butterfly'' -- a watch
whose case is in an elaborate butterfly design comprising 222
diamonds, six rubies, nine pink sapphires and mother of pearl. All
for just $108,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also on display: the glittering ''Lady Kalla'' watch with a
diamond studded bracelet. The price is $287,000.
</P>
<P>
   After years of fretting about foreign competition and economic
recession, the Swiss watch industry is booming.
</P>
<P>
   Exports of watches and watch parts rose to a record $5.4 billion
last year, up 7 percent from 1998. Sales of luxury watches -- those
that cost more than $300 -- soared 12 percent to $3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The increase was largely due to a 14 percent rise in sales to
the biggest customer, the United States, which last year bought
$900 million worth of Swiss watches. Bumper orders also came from
Asia -- Hong Kong and Japan are the second and third biggest
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Hayek said the Swatch group, which owns expensive brands like
Longines and Omega, will stick to the much bigger Basel watch fair,
which is open to all comers -- until Geneva organizers change their
snobbish attitude.
</P>
<P>
   As proof that his clientele can compete with the best, he cites
the example of President Clinton, who called for an impromptu
supper at a highway rest stop after an international conference in
the Swiss Alps in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''He bought American cola, American pizza and six plastic Swatch
watches,'' said Hayek.
</P>
<P>
   ''And if you see Gianni Agnelli, the richest man in Italy, he
wears a Swatch,'' added Hayek, referring to the Fiat industrial
tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what you call luxury.''

<HEADLINE> Russians Find 32 Dead Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUDERMES, Russia (AP) -- After two days of scouring the hills for
dozens of comrades who disappeared in a deadly rebel ambush,
Russian soldiers found 33 of the missing men Saturday -- all but one
dead, and many of them booby-trapped so their bodies couldn't be
retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   Six more servicemen were still missing in the wake of Thursday's
devastating attack on a convoy of 49 Interior Ministry troops -- the
latest in a series of Chechen rebel strikes that have inflicted
heavy losses on the Russians, demonstrating their vulnerability
despite their claims to control Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Four soldiers were killed immediately and six fled back to their
base after the attack in the southern village of Zhani-Vedeno,
about four miles outside the town of Vedeno, where hundreds of
rebels are believed to be hiding.
</P>
<P>
   The 32 bodies found Saturday brought the death toll in the
ambush to at least three dozen. Troops took 19 of the newly
discovered corpses with them, but 13 others had to be left behind
because they had been rigged with mines, the Interior Ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
   The search continued for the soldiers still missing, but the
operation was hindered by rugged terrain, land mines and
hit-and-run attacks by rebels, the Russian military said.
</P>
<P>
   The report of the discovered bodies came as the U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights flew to the North Caucasus region
Saturday to investigate reports of rights abuses in the Chechen
war.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Robinson's two-day tour of the region was expected to
include a visit Sunday to the Chernokozovo detention center in
Chechnya, where human rights groups allege Russians routinely
torture prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson visited a Chechen refugee camp in the Ingush village of
Sleptsovskaya Saturday to ask about conditions at the camp and
whether refugees felt it was too dangerous to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is impossible to return, everyone has lost their homes,
everyone had family members killed,'' Aza Yupayeva, a refugee from
the Chechen capital, Grozny, said she told Robinson. ''There are no
laws. Federal troops are running amok.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's visit came before a scheduled April 3-4 meeting of
the Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights
watchdog. Delegates will discuss whether to suspend Russia for
alleged abuses in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the allegations of torture, Russia has been
repeatedly accused of waging an indiscriminate bombing campaign
here, disregarding civilian life and causing needless destruction.
Russia denies the claims, saying it is acting appropriately and
must restore order to Chechnya, which became rife with crime,
kidnapping and violence after Russian troops withdrew in defeat at
the end of a 1994-96 war.
</P>
<P>
   Russia began its latest campaign in late September and has
driven most of the rebels out of the flatlands and into the
mountains that make up the republic's southern third. But the
rebels have shown little sign of quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has gradually tried to restore normal life to areas
within its control. Chechnya's mayor, Supyan Mokhchayev, said
restrictions on entering and leaving Grozny were lifted Saturday,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Mokhchayev said the
restrictions had been imposed to allow Russian forces to clear
Grozny of mines planted by rebels.

<HEADLINE> Reno Says Only Elian's Dad Has Say  </HEADLINE>
By KIMBERLY LAMKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno appealed
to Americans on Saturday not to politicize the case of 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez and said that the boy's father should have the right
to speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who favors returning the boy to his father in Cuba, spoke
during a discussion on international law at the University of
Virginia Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Her comments came two days after Vice President Al Gore broke
with the Clinton administration and called for keeping the boy in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is so important for all Americans to make sure we
don't politicize the issue, that we do this within the law ... that
we get it done in an orderly and calm and fair way,'' Reno said in
response to a student's question during the forum. She did not
elaborate on the point.
</P>
<P>
   She also reiterated her belief that the prerogative for
determining the future of a child Elian's age belongs first to his
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the recognition in this case is that a father must
speak for a 6-year-old, and particularly in the difficult
circumstances Elian has been in, the parent is the one that should
be speaking for him,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued off the Florida coast in November after the
boat he was on sank during a voyage to reach the United States. His
mother, who was divorced from his father, died along with 10
others.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, contends the boy belongs with
him in Cuba, and the island's communist government has said
Gonzalez is willing to travel to the United States to retrieve him
from the boy's great-uncle, with whom Elian has been living in
Miami.

<HEADLINE> Group Protests French Oil Spill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A group protesting an oil spill last year that
contaminated France's Atlantic coast on Saturday dumped three tons
of oily sand, mixed with dead fish, on Paris' chic Avenue
Montaigne.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the Protection for the Coastal Environment
Outrageously Dirtied was aimed at Thierry Desmarest, president of
TotalFina, the Franco-Belgian oil company that protesters blame for
the oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   The group said Desmarest lives in an apartment along the avenue,
but TotalFina denied the claim. When police arrived, the group
cleaned up the mess, putting the sand back in a dump truck.
</P>
<P>
   The incident preceded a silent march through Paris by up to
3,000 people showing their anger over the spill on Dec. 12, when a
Maltese-registered tanker chartered by TotalFina split in two in
rough waters, spilling 3 million gallons of heavy oil.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute for the Industrial Environment and Risks
said in March that the oil contained carcinogenic substances,
presenting a ''real risk'' to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters want TotalFina to foot the bill for the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group calling itself the Armed Group for the
Defense of the Environment tried to set fire to a Total service
station in Dury, in the Somme region north of Paris, local
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Total merged with Belgian oil group Petrofina in 1998 to form
TotalFina.
</P>
<P>
   The previously unheard-of group claimed responsibility for the
attempt.

<HEADLINE> Military Schools Making a Comeback  </HEADLINE>
By JOSHUA KUCERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORK UNION, Va. (AP) -- Military schools, with their square
notions of crisp uniforms and strict discipline, were once as
trendy as a buzz cut.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, there were 160 of the institutions nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are just 40, but their concept -- and their
enrollment -- is making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Two new military schools are in the works, existing institutions
report rising piles of applications and even the liberal mayor of
Oakland, Calif., Jerry Brown, is supporting military-style
education as a remedy for troubled schools in his city.
</P>
<P>
   ''The discipline issue, the organizational skills that we teach,
the core values of spirituality, honesty and integrity. ... Parents
are not finding those kind of things in public schools,'' said John
Jackson, a retired Air Force lieutenant general who serves as
president of Fork Union Military Academy in central Virginia.
Applications there are up 15 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cadets at the rural school, about 50 miles west of Richmond,
attend a full day of classes, then go to marching drills, sports
practice, dinner, a two-hour study session and bed.
</P>
<P>
   They acknowledge the strict rules and remote location can chafe,
but overall they give the school high marks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's done nothing but good for me,'' said Jim Davis, 18, of
Richmond, who is taking a fifth high school year at Fork Union to
become eligible to play defensive end at Virginia Tech next year.
''I was so lazy (before), but being here, there's no time to be
lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Akers, 18, of Charleston, W.Va., said Fork Union has
boosted his grades to a B average.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not easy at all,'' he said. ''It's because you're
disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nonconformists don't do well here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the attraction for some parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public schools have slipped a lot recently,'' said David
Morris of Bridgeport, W.Va., who has one son at Fork Union and
another who graduated. ''For one thing, they just don't have the
discipline they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Some public school districts, including Chicago and Richmond,
have turned to military education methods to improve ailing
inner-city schools. In Jerry Brown's Oakland, California Gov. Gray
Davis has proposed $1.3 million in state money to open an
Oakland-Alameda Military Institute this fall.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, conservative parents are getting more
aggressive in finding alternatives to public education.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1965, two new military high schools are
being planned: Virginia Naval Academy in northern Virginia and
Oceana Naval Air Academy on the Gulf Coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that is due to the booming economy, which has
contributed to an increase in admissions in all boarding schools,
including military schools, said Steve Ruzicka, executive director
of the Association of Boarding Schools.
</P>
<P>
   At Fork Union, where tuition, fees and uniforms run about
$18,000 a year, about 15 percent of cadets get financial aid. A
year at other military schools can run $9,000 to $22,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   About 98 percent of Fork Union's graduates go on to college,
about 20 percent of those to service academies or private military
colleges. The school's last two valedictorians went to Harvard,
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, military school officials say, they keep bumping up
against an old stereotype: military school as a place to punish a
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are fighting as hard as we can against that outmoded
image,'' said Lewis Sorley, executive director of the Association
of Military Colleges and Schools of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While the 102-year-old Fork Union remains an all-male school,
about a third of military high schools now accept girls.
</P>
<P>
   And as Lt. Col. Jim Akers, Fork Union's admissions director, put
it: ''No one's going to spend the kind of money it takes to go to
this school to punish a kid.''

<HEADLINE> Protesters Want Suharto Questioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Demonstrators angry that former
President Suharto will not face questioning over corruption
allegations shoved toward his residence Saturday and shouted ''Hang
Suharto!''
</P>
<P>
   Riot police fired tear gas and attacked the protesters, who
pushed against a line of police blocking access to the street where
the ex-president lives. The protesters pelted stones at the
officers, who responded with tear gas and a baton charge.
</P>
<P>
   At least two protesters were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the 79-year-old Suharto, who suffered a slight
stroke last year, said he is too ill to be interrogated. But
government doctors who examined him said he was fit enough to be
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was the latest in recent days. Earlier,
hundreds of protesters rallied to protest hikes in electricity and
public transport fees, a day after the government backed down on a
similar plan to raise fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   The government's move, announced by President Abdurrahman Wahid,
defused plans by student and labor groups to mount massive protests
in the capital and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   However, about 500 students and workers did gather peacefully in
front of the national parliament building in downtown Jakarta
carrying banners reading ''We demand free education,'' ''No price
rises,'' and ''Down with capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, meanwhile, said the cost of electricity and
public transport would go up as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the government pushed up gasoline prices by
cutting fuel subsidies, Indonesians took to the streets in bloody
riots that ousted Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to reduce government subsidies is due to pressure
from international lenders who want to see Indonesia become a more
market-oriented economy.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton picks up union endorsements  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton was to pick up the
endorsements of two politically powerful labor unions Saturday in
her battle for the Senate against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   In Syracuse, the first lady was to be greeted by about 500
leaders of the Civil Service Employees Association, whose 265,000
members make it the state's second largest public employee union.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Saratoga Springs, Clinton was to address about 500
teachers attending the annual delegate assembly of the
40,000-member National Education Association of New York, the
state's second largest teachers' union.
</P>
<P>
   The union backing means money and volunteers for the Senate
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago when Democrat Charles Schumer unseated Republican
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the CSEA remained neutral in the race while
the state's powerful teacher unions lined up behind the challenger.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the first lady will deliver the keynote address to
the annual convention of the New York State United Teachers Union
being held in New York City. The 430,000-member NYSUT is the
state's largest public employee union and its largest teachers'
union. It is expected to endorse Clinton later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been courting labor unions heavily as she attempts
to put together the traditional coalition of labor, minorities and
the poor that has helped other Democrats win in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This past Sunday, Clinton was in Albany to pick up the
endorsement of the Working Families Party, a labor-union backed
party founded in 1998 to help push the Democratic Party to the
left.
</P>
<P>
   ''That nomination makes our point about Mrs. Clinton being a
candidate of the far left,'' Giuliani said a day later.
</P>
<P>
   While the first lady has been lining up union support, the New
York City mayor has been beating her in fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Giuliani campaign announced it had raised $7
million during the first three months of this year. Clinton aides
said she had raised $4 million. Since the fund raising began last
year, Giuliani has raised $19 million and Clinton has collected $12
million in what is expected to become the most expensive Senate
race in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   A poll out Wednesday from Marist College's Institute for Public
Opinion had the race about even with Giuliani favored by 46 percent
of voters surveyed and Clinton backed by 43 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
   The NEA endorsement comes as no surprise. Last summer, the
national NEA gave the first lady its highest award during a
ceremony in Florida at which NEA President Bob Chase told 9,000
delegates that Clinton was ''a national treasure.''

<HEADLINE> Another year, another late budget in New York  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- That sound you didn't hear from Albany as
this April 1st arrived wasn't from an absence of howling protest,
or gnashing of teeth from state legislators and the governor as
another fiscal year began without a new budget.
</P>
<P>
   A shrug of the shoulders makes no sound.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature and governor accepted their latest failure -- it
is the 16th straight year in New York in which the budget has been
late -- with hardly an acknowledgment that anything was even wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The days leading up to the start of the 2000-01 fiscal year were
marked by no conclusive fiscal discussions between Gov. George
Pataki and legislative leaders, no public talks over the budget in
legislative conference committees and no substantial protests about
yet another late budget.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Dollinger, a Rochester Democrat, was among
only a handful of legislators casting symbolic votes against a $2.4
billion emergency appropriations bill approved by lawmakers
Thursday before they left town for this weekend. It is designed to
cover state spending from April 1-16.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just worn down,'' Dollinger said. ''This is a process of
attrition and ... frankly, no one even talks about it any more. It
seems to me we fail the public credibility test every time we do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll last month from Siena College suggests that Dollinger is
right. Ninety percent of New Yorkers age 18 and older surveyed said
an on-time budget is either ''important'' or ''very important'' to
them and that both the governor's and the Legislature's approval
ratings go down during budget impasses.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also true that there has been no known instance of a
lawmaker getting voted out of office by constituents angry about
late budgets.
</P>
<P>
   For a second year, lawmakers will face a more tangible loss when
their $3,057-every-two-weeks paychecks will be withheld for as long
as they go past April 1 without approving a new budget.
</P>
<P>
   A late budget was inevitable this year since March 10. That's
when a deadline passed without a consensus between the Legislature
and governor on available revenues to spend in fiscal 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, some secret negotiations between the governor and
legislative leaders failed to lead to the convening of conference
committees by the Legislature to discuss details of how to spend
the $500 million to $1.3 billion -- or more -- that the Legislature
will appropriate above the $76.8 billion Pataki has proposed
spending.
</P>
<P>
   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said he would not
participate in any closed-door bargaining sessions over the budget
this year, but he relented last week in hopes of getting the
conference committee process jump started. It didn't produce a
deal, but Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said he thought an
agreement could be reached this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's possible,'' he said. ''I think probable.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's budget-making process was also being called as
secretive and exclusionary as any in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very much underground,'' state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall said. ''Nobody seems to know. The members are always the
last to know. .. They are all in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Fortuna, president of the New York City-based Citizens
Budget Commission, said the ''quality of the process does seem to
be deteriorating in the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only have the budgets gotten later but consensus seems
more and more elusive for state leaders,'' Fortuna said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Roy Goodman, a Manhattan Republican, joked that this
year's budget-making process has been ''progressive
retrogression.''
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat, said he
was sticking by a prediction he first made in 1999 -- that the
budget would be adopted in a month beginning with the letter ''a.''
Unfortunately, last year that month wasn't April but August, and
the Aug. 4 adoption missed breaking by a matter of hours the
all-time record for a late budget in New York. The previous record
was set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Chief disagreements in the 2000-01 budget are over tax cuts,
spending on transportation facilities and funding of some education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno, who has been feuding with his fellow Republican Pataki,
said last week his relationship with the governor was not a factor
in delaying a new budget. But Democrats in the Assembly missed few
opportunities in March to allude to the Bruno-Pataki tiff and
suggest it would hinder the high-level budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is as crazed as it can get,'' Assemblyman Richard Brodsky,
D-Westchester, said. ''We are holding the coats of Sen. Bruno and
Gov. Pataki and expect to do a three-way agreement when the winner
and the loser of that particular battle emerges.''

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A state agency says it is not abandoning a
study about the health of New York senior citizens who were
enrolled in programs which provided them with nutritious meals.
</P>
<P>
   The state Office for the Aging will run out of the $70,000
budgeted for the program at the end of this month. Officials will
meet soon with experts at the State University of New York at
Albany to determine if that school can complete the study, or
recommend the best way it be finished, according to Frank
DeMarinis, deputy director of local program operations at the aging
office.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarinis and advocates for the elderly say the study of the
health of about 200 seniors in New York is the only one of its kind
ever conducted in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   They say it will provide the first scientific look at the
effects of nutrition on older people, and offer some idea about how
much less care -- hospitalization, doctors' visits, nursing home
stays -- elderly people getting proper food needed compared with
those not getting the right nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no study like this in the country,'' said Greg Olsen
of the Statewide Senior Action Council. ''This is the state of the
art. This is the holy grail to show what we've all been saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen said the study will show that it is not only morally right
for proper food to be available for older people who cannot afford
it, but also that it makes economic sense because of lower health
care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen estimated it would take another $50,000 or so for the
study to be completed by having the data analyzed by researchers
expert at reviewing medical and statistical information.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is basically done,'' Olsen said. ''It needs to be
analyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMarinis said how much his office needs to complete the study,
and where the agency will try to find the money, hinges on what the
SUNY-Albany experts say.
</P>
<P>
   At a state Assembly hearing late last month in Montgomery County
on rural hunger, Assemblyman Paul Tonko said the prospect of the
study being abandoned was ''very tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not like investing $70,000,'' Tonko said. ''That's like
throwing it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen responded, ''We're talking about an almost $80 billion
budget. I don't think it would be all that difficult to find
$50,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the state's new fiscal year is expected to total
about $78 million when finally enacted by the governor and
Legislature.

<HEADLINE> Tutsi Nominated for Rwandan Leader  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Vice President Paul Kagame's Rwandan
Patriotic Front nominated him for the presidency Saturday, clearing
his way to become Rwanda's first Tutsi leader since independence in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   After a one-day closed meeting, the Tutsi-dominated RPF
announced it would put Kagame and the party's secretary-general,
Charles Muligande, before parliament on April 14-20 for a final
vote on a successor to Pasteur Bizimungu, who resigned last week.
</P>
<P>
   The RPF, which stopped Rwanda's 1994 genocide and remains the
strongest force in the central African country, is guaranteed
Rwanda's presidency and vice presidency under a power-sharing
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   While the party is going through the formality of giving
parliament two candidates from which to choose, Kagame is widely
expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame, who is also minister of defense and the top army
commander, led the former rebels to victory in July 1994 against an
extremist Hutu government that ordered the 100-day massacre of more
than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame became interim president following Bizimungu's
resignation last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, flags flew at half-staff throughout Rwanda as the
nation opened a week of mourning for victims of the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The week will culminate in a mass reburial of the remains of
those killed in the capital, Kigali.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda is governed under a 1993 power-sharing agreement with the
RPF, the former Hutu government and other, smaller political
parties, who are allocated seats in the Cabinet and parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Since winning power, Kagame has been reluctant to assume the
country's top job, apparently for fear of antagonizing the
country's majority Hutu population and confirming the perception
that Rwanda is ruled by minority Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Rwanda extended for another five years a transitional
period before committing itself to elections. The government argued
that ethnic divisions stemming from the genocide are still too
wide.
</P>
<P>
   Bizimungu, a 49-year Hutu, resigned after blaming parliament of
using an anti-graft campaign to unjustly prosecute Hutu ministers.
But the legislators accused him of covering his own incompetence
and sowing ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Hutus were second-class citizens during the Belgian colonial
era. Rwanda's only previous Tutsi ruler, a king, was overthrown in
1959.

<HEADLINE> Descriptions of Uganda Cult Leaders  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A brief look at the leaders of the Movement for the
Restoration
of the Ten Commandments of God:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   JOSEPH KIBWETERE: Kibwetere is a former school administrator who
had a lifelong interest in Catholic visionaries. The 64-year-old
has been widely touted as the leader of the Movement. Also known as
''The Prophet,'' he was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Kibwetere met Credonia Mwerinde in Nyamitanga, Uganda, where he
and his wife had gone to hear her testify about her visions of the
Virgin Mary. He took Mwerinde into his home, which served as the
cult's compound for three years.
</P>
<P>
   After relocating to Mwerinde's hometown of Kanungu, Uganda,
Kibwetere became a self-styled bishop, donning a bishop's ring and
vestments. He never spoke to his family again.
</P>
<P>
   Kibwetere is believed by some members of his family to have
perished in a March 17 church fire with hundreds of other cult
members. Other reports have said he could have escaped.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   CREDONIA MWERINDE: On Aug. 24, 1988, Mwerinde claimed to have
had a vision of the Virgin Mary in a cave near the Ugandan village
of Ngakishenyi. Within the cult, she was known as ''The
Programmer'' and claimed to have direct contact with God and the
Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Her former common-law husband said that before her vision,
Mwerinde ran a shop that sold banana beer and a fiery local liquor.
Press accounts have referred to her as a prostitute, but residents
say that while promiscuous, the 48-year-old was not paid for sex.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kibwetere's family, Mwerinde was the true leader of
the cult. She and four relatives were said to be five of the sect's
''12 Apostles.''
</P>
<P>
   Her whereabouts at the time of the church fire are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   DOMINIC KATARIBABO: At least 155 bodies were found in two graves
on land owned by the excommunicated Roman Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   Kataribabo studied for a doctorate in theology in a Los
Angeles-area seminary in the mid-1980s, one of his nephews said. He
later got into trouble with his diocese in Uganda for how he used
donations collected in Los Angeles and for his interest in Mwerinde
and her visions.
</P>
<P>
   Kataribabo, 32, became a leader in the sect soon after he was
excommunicated in the early 1990s. He taught seminars at the church
compound in Kanungu covering the cult's prophecies on righteous
living and the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   His family told police that Kataribabo had been digging a pit to
install a refrigerator in his house. Police found 81 bodies under
the floor and 74 more in a sugarcane field outside.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe Kataribabo died in the church fire, citing as
evidence a clerical collar found on one of the bodies.

<HEADLINE> A History of Mount Usu  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Some background on Mount Usu, in northern Japan,
which has come
back to life after more than two decades of silence:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   THE VOLCANO: Mount Usu is one of 86 active volcanoes in Japan.
It is known to have erupted eight times in the past 300 years. Its
last eruption began in 1977 and continued into the following year,
starting mudslides that killed at least two people. An eruption in
1822 killed 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   THE TOWNS: Several towns lie at the base of the volcano, many
depending on volcanic hot springs and the scenic Lake Toya to draw
tourists. Date, the largest city near Usu, has a population of
35,656. Altogether, about 51,000 people live near the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   THE THREATS: Past eruptions of Usu have generally not included
quantities of glowing red lava running down its slopes, as seen in
Hawaii. Here, eruptions have been accompanied by pyroclastic flows
-- a roiling mixture of superheated gas, rock and ash that can race
down the mountain at speeds of 60 mph or more. Experts worry that
the eruptions could melt the blanket of snow on Usu, starting
landslides.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LAST MAJOR ERUPTION: The most recent volcanic eruption in Japan
that led to deaths was at Mount Unzen, in southern Japan, which
rumbled to life in 1990 after 200 years of dormancy. Some 43 people
died on Unzen, many of them journalists.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Faults Congress on Energy  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton criticized Congress for
failing to protect the nation's energy security in the face of
rising oil and gasoline prices, especially by not renewing his
authority to tap government oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should ''waste no more time,'' give him unfettered
access to the emergency stockpile and pass a range of energy
measures vital to maintaining a strong economy, Clinton said
Saturday in a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, R-Ill., responded with an attack on Clinton
administration energy policies, which he said have put the country
at the mercy of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic oil reserve, established in 1975 after
OPEC-sponsored early-1970s production cuts sent prices skyrocketing
in the United States, has been used only by former President Bush.
His partial drawdown in 1991, at the beginning of the Persian Gulf
War, maintained market stability and kept prices down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not withdrawn oil from the stockpile during the
current steep rise in international petroleum prices that has pump
prices in the United States averaging well over $1.50 a gallon. But
White House officials said he has not excluded a drawdown from
possible responses.
</P>
<P>
   The president noted that the Senate approved a four-year
extension of his authority to draw from the reserve, but the
authority expired Friday when the House failed to act.
</P>
<P>
   ''While my administration has worked hard to increase the supply
of oil on the market, the House has failed to take one of the most
critical steps necessary to maintain America's energy security,''
Clinton wrote. ''The option to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
is an essential line of defense against an interruption in oil
supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   He said renewing his authorization immediately ''is critical ...
to ensure that the United States maintains its ability to use all
available tools to respond to the needs of the U.S. economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the reauthorization, a White House official said,
the president would have other steps available to obtain oil from
the reserve. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, did
not spell them out.
</P>
<P>
   Reauthorization by Congress, however, ''provides the clearest
unchallenged action'' the president could take to tap the reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's response to the Clinton letter stressed the
involvement of Vice President Al Gore, this year's apparent
Democratic presidential candidate, in formulating energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the political posturing of the president's letter cannot
cover up the fact that the Gore energy policy has been a complete
failure,'' Hastert said in a statement relayed by a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States should never be put in the position where
OPEC is dictating the prices of oil,'' the speaker said. ''The
administration's own energy secretary admitted they were caught
napping.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert did not directly address Clinton's demand that the House
reauthorize his access to the petroleum reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said OPEC, under strong international pressure, agreed
this week to increase production by 1.7 million barrels a day.
Other producers were expected to expand production as well to fill
a 2-million-barrel-a-day shortfall that has tripled crude oil
prices over the last 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our focused diplomatic efforts helped produce tangible
commitments by oil-producing nations to increase production to more
appropriate levels that reflect current demand in the global
economy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, he also faulted the House for failing to act on
other energy proposals that he said would help in dealing with
overseas oil price hikes over the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited these pending proposals:
</P>
<P>
   --To establish a regional home heating oil reserve in the
Northeast that could ''reduce the likelihood of future heating oil
shortages.''
</P>
<P>
   --To fully finance the $1.4 billion he has requested to promote
more energy-efficient buildings, homes and cars.
</P>
<P>
   --To provide tax incentives for domestic oil producers ''to
reduce U.S. reliance on oil imports.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These critical steps will strengthen the sound, comprehensive
energy strategy that has helped sustain the longest economic
expansion in American history,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress should waste no more time in enacting these measures
into law.''

<HEADLINE> Turkish Soldiers Cross Into Iraq  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- At least 1,000 Turkish soldiers crossed
into northern Iraq, apparently the start of their yearly spring
campaign against Kurdish rebel hideouts there, military sources
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three days, soldiers have gone three miles into
Iraqi territory from the Turkish provinces of Hakkari and Sirnak,
Turkish military and local sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey regularly crosses into northern Iraq to chase rebels of
the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which have been fighting a
15-year war for autonomy in southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 50,000 troops are gathered on the Turkish-Iraqi border,
ready to take part in a large-scale operation, Turkish and Kurdish
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   During their operations in northern Iraq, the Turkish army often
keeps a three-mile buffer zone inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Private television NTV reported that the troops crossed the
border after receiving information that the rebels were
re-establishing camps close to the border. No serious clashes have
been reported, NTV said.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish rebels retreated into bases in northern Iraq before the
winter after announcing a cease-fire and a withdrawal from Turkey.
They later announced an end to armed struggle and say they are
ready to surrender if Turkey grants cultural rights to its 12
million Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   The operation would come as Turkey is under increasing pressure
from Europe to find a peaceful solution to the war and grant more
rights to Kurds, who are not recognized as an official minority.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the PKK's political wing in Europe warned that a
Turkish operation would lead to renewed clashes -- which have been
reduced to a trickle since the PKK's withdrawal last year.
</P>
<P>
   He said the PKK would defend itself if attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Some 37,000 people, mostly Kurds, have been killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's northern areas are outside Baghdad's control, governed by
two rival Iraqi Kurdish factions. One of the factions has been
fighting the PKK alongside the Turkish army.

<HEADLINE> Car of East German Leader Auctioned  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Karl-Heinz Juergens remembers the jubilant night
he walked through the Brandenburg Gate on Nov. 9, 1989, treading
through forbidden no-man's land as the Berlin Wall fell.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Wall's gone, he can drive through -- and in style:
with the car former East German leader Erich Honecker rode in.
</P>
<P>
   Juergens was the winning bidder Saturday at an auction of
Honecker's 1978 Citroen CX 2300 Prestige, paying $10,000 for the
car with its tan leather interior that was once graced by the late
communist leader.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the collapse of East Germany, communist kitsch
has acquired a certain trendiness as people's memories fade of the
darker side of the totalitarian regime.
</P>
<P>
   But this car will not be cruising the streets of Berlin anytime
soon. Juergens, a former East German, said he hopes to give the car
to a museum so that younger generations do not forget their
history.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should be a monument,'' said Juergens, 51, who now runs a
press agency with his wife. ''I've met many young people who don't
know much about the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Juergens had been questioning the authenticity of
the car just before the auction, which drew about 150 spectators
and hordes of media to a Berlin hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the auction went to benefit the children's cancer
section of a Berlin hospital. Even if the car wasn't really used by
Honecker, Juergens said he was still happy to help a good cause and
had no plans to ask for his money back.
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband is emotional. When he sees a good cause he gives
everything,'' said his wife, Urda.
</P>
<P>
   With its metallic brown-green exterior -- reminiscent of the
color scheme of just about every communist office -- and black vinyl
roof, the car boasts 124 horsepower and has 28,673 miles on the
odometer.
</P>
<P>
   Auctioneer Mark Karhausen said he took it for a test spin on the
autobahn at 125 mph -- and it was easy driving all the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an everyday car, I can really recommend it,'' Karhausen
said, adding that the car had passed its technical inspections just
last week. ''This car doesn't have anything that says it's a
typical East German car.''
</P>
<P>
   The car had been used for private trips by Honecker, meaning it
isn't armored and the windows can be rolled down.
</P>
<P>
   The Citroen was also equipped with a portable radio that
Honecker used to conduct party business. Although its hatchback
body is relatively long and may not be easy to park in Berlin, the
car does come with an East German parking permit allowing one to
park in front of the former East German leader's office -- now being
used as a temporary office by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Honecker last used the car in 1987. It was then given to the
office of foreign trade and used by a defense minister before being
handed over in 1989 to an artists' agency. The car had been in
private hands since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Honecker died in exile in Chile in May 1994.

<HEADLINE> Actor Ed Burns Might Buy JFK's Pad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The late John F. Kennedy Jr.'s loft apartment
could soon be in the hands of actor Edward Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, 32, has negotiated a deal to buy the posh penthouse in
New York's trendy Tribeca neighborhood for less than the reported
minimum $2.5 million asking price, both the Daily News and the New
York Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy bought the 2,400-square-foot loft in a nondescript
former commercial building for $700,000 in 1994. It has been on the
market via sealed bids by Sotheby's International Realty.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who has appeared in such films as ''Saving Private Ryan''
and ''She's The One,'' still needs approval from the property's
co-op board.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Sotheby's realty wouldn't comment. Mara
Buxbaum, Burns' publicist, said the actor had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn, and her sister were killed in July
when the plane Kennedy was piloting crashed off Martha's Vineyard.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- A crowded bus plunged into a river in
western Kenya Saturday, killing at least 11 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The accident comes the same week as Kenya's deadliest-ever bus
accident, a fiery head-on collision between two buses in which 74
passengers burned alive.
</P>
<P>
   The latest accident occurred when a bus hit a pothole and
careened into the Gianchera river, traffic patrol officer Thomas
Atipo said. Sixty-six seriously injured survivors were
hospitalized, Atipo said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened 150 miles northwest of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Although long-distance buses in Kenya generally are licensed to
carry only 62 passengers, most carry many more -- often, double the

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A congressional narcotics
investigation has led to the arrests of 10 Brazilian policemen
accused of links to drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Rio de Janeiro State Security chief Josias Quintal ordered four
police detectives arrested after they testified before a
congressional panel in Rio on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The four were accused of extorting money from Brazil's
most-wanted drug trafficker, known as Fernandinho Beira-Mar. The
other six officers arrested were federal police agents accused of
helping drug trafficker Ademir Cavalline escape from police
headquarters in December.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, warrants were issued for three other officers and
the panel subpoenaed the bank, tax and telephone records of seven
more.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's investigation, which began last year, has led to the
arrest of more than 120 suspects, including judges, businessmen and
police officers. Brazilians have dubbed the investigators ''The
Untouchables'' -- a reference to the group of U.S. federal agents
under Eliot Ness who smashed Al Capone's liquor operations during
Prohibition.

<HEADLINE> Criminals Await Deportation  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL CENTRO, Calif. (AP) -- Hoang Duc Nguyen's 10-month prison
sentence ended five months ago, but he is still behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law says the 30-year-old immigrant must be deported, but
the country he fled as a child refugee won't take him back.
</P>
<P>
   That's left Nguyen in a legal no man's land, and he isn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 3,400 immigrants with criminal records are in
similar holding patterns at Immigration and Naturalization Service
detention centers and jails across the United States. Some have
waited four years for authorities to decide what to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to get out of this place,'' Nguyen, who was born
in Vietnam, said as he sat at a visitor's booth at the INS
detention center in El Centro, about 120 miles east of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 of the 500 prisoners at the center cannot be returned
to their countries. Instead, they're left living in a
barracks-style jail in the desert that was designed to hold illegal
migrant workers for a few days, not years.
</P>
<P>
   The INS already is struggling with a record number of prisoners.
Tougher immigrations laws have more than doubled the numbers to
18,000 since 1996, when Congress eliminated a requirement that the
INS release anyone who couldn't be deported within six months.
</P>
<P>
   Those immigrants who are stuck here, like Nguyen, come from a
handful of countries, including Cuba, Laos and Vietnam, that won't
take them back.
</P>
<P>
   ''We keep hearing that the State Department is negotiating with
these countries to try to send some of these people back,'' said
Kim Porter, an INS assistant district director in San Diego.
''We're at their mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the chairman of a House subcommittee that
funds immigration operations blasted the INS after Justice
Department figures showed nearly 12,000 of the 35,000 immigrants
with criminal records released over the past five years committed
new crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the INS said many of the releases weren't at the
agency's discretion because the incarcerated immigrants had won
their deportation cases or because bond was allowed by immigration
and federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, INS has freed about 1,000 convicted immigrants
on bond under special review. But those awaiting review, and those
deemed too risky to release, simply must wait.
</P>
<P>
   If Nguyen had a choice, he would stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived with his family in 1979, but never completed his
citizenship application. Then, in the mid-1990s, he was convicted
twice of cocaine possession and ordered deported as a ''criminal
alien.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I came here as a kid and I don't know anything about
Vietnam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He fought the deportation order, but as the weeks at El Centro
turned into months, he grew tired of the legal wrangling and the
boredom of confinement. The center has also become a dangerous
place, he said. Fights are common and there were two riots within
the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he gave up on his bid to stay in America. He hopes
the INS will review his case later this spring and release him on
bond to wait while officials try to reach a deportation agreement
with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could go pick him up and deport him without any
warning,'' said his lawyer, Gary Finn. ''He'll always have that
hanging over him. But he'd rather have that than stay in custody.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't know when you are going to get out or if you're
going to get out; it's psychologically traumatizing,'' said Robert
Boyle, a federal public defender in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration authorities insist they have no choice in the matter
and are simply following the will of Congress. ''INS gains
absolutely nothing by keeping people in detention longer than
necessary,'' said INS spokesman Russ Bergeron.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's budget has more than doubled with its booming
population, rising to $809 million from $366 million in 1996. This
year, officials plan to increase the agency's holding capacity by
1,000 spaces, and begin transferring 500 prisoners to the federal
Bureau of Prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials readily admit centers like the one in El Centro
are not designed to hold convicts for long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Costa, 42, who came to the United States from Cuba
in 1980, has spent nearly 2{ years there and given up any thought
of staying in America. He has appealed to the Red Cross to help him
get home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to be involved in this anymore,'' Costa said. ''I
just want to finish it and go back to my country.''

<HEADLINE> Some Say Census Questions Intrusive  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If a Census Bureau worker knocks on James
Snead's door this summer asking him to answer questions he left
blank on his form, he will offer a polite ''no thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Snead believes people shouldn't cooperate with the
once-a-decade count. He just thinks too many private questions are
asked on the 53-question long form he -- and one in six of the
country's 115 million households -- received.
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue that has popped up in Snead's hometown of
Virginia Beach, Va., as well as on editorial pages, radio talk
shows and Capitol Hill: Is the census intruding on people's lives?
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they are just going a little overboard on this. I
don't tell anybody how much money I make, and it's really nobody's
business either,'' said Snead, complaining about a question that
asked for his annual income. Snead received the form two weeks ago,
filled out just his name and address, and promptly mailed it back
with a letter of protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that I distrust the government, but when they turn
around and tell me I have to do something ... well, I think I've
earned the right not to do something if I choose not to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The envelopes that census forms arrive in are emblazoned with
the sentence, ''Your response is required by law.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Census Bureau, Kenneth Prewitt, said his
agency needs all the questions on its forms answered because the
results are crucial to redistributing federal funds for local
services.
</P>
<P>
   --How do fire companies know how to get to a fire? They use maps
that are drawn from Census Bureau demographic data, Prewitt says.
</P>
<P>
   --Why does the government want to know if you are a veteran? To
find out if adequate services for veterans are being provided in
your community. If not, maybe a new veterans hospital should be
built, Prewitt says.
</P>
<P>
   According to a national survey commissioned in March by the
Census Bureau, 72 percent of Americans said they intended to
participate, and 75 percent felt the allocation of public funds was
a persuasive reason to complete their questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Intrusive, not at all. I don't think they ask probing
questions. It affects many things that go on in my community,''
said Raenard Brown of Washington, as he waited in line at a job
fair recruiting temporary workers for the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Evelyn Roddy do not buy Prewitt's reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe it. It's just a guilt trip to get you to fill
your form,'' said Roddy, of Sacramento, Calif. She said she filled
out about half of her long form before she ''realized how intrusive
it really was,'' then mailed it back -- along with a letter to
Prewitt complaining that she felt her privacy was being violated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the census is good, but it's been blown completely out
of proportion over what it was intended to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Roddy says a question asking if your child is
natural or adopted does not make sense because ''it makes no
difference if they're adopted or not, they are still your
children.'' (The Census Bureau says that question is necessary to
keep track of the changing composition of the American family, and
adjust related federal programs accordingly.)
</P>
<P>
   Worries over an invasion of privacy by the census are not new.
The issue pops up every census, Census Bureau officials say.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Census Day, the Clinton administration stepped up
its campaign to encourage participation.
</P>
<P>
   The president, in his weekly radio address, said ''those who
suggest that filling out your census form isn't essential are
plainly wrong.'' He said he realized Americans are concerned about
their privacy ''and that's why I also want to stress that the
information you provide is strictly, absolutely confidential,''
</P>
<P>
   Added Prewitt: ''To tell the American people not to complete the
form is to tell them to break the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt told reporters he was worried about poll data showing
growing public sensitivity to the privacy issue and was concerned
that a low rate of mail-in returns of census forms would leave a
''huge task'' for the agency when it begins knocking on people's
doors later this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in Congress say they have received a number of
complaints about census forms, and have told callers to leave
intrusive questions unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush said that
if he received the long form he was not sure he would fill it out.
The Texas governor did not advise people not to complete the form
but added, ''If they're worried about the government intruding into
their personal lives, they ought to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said they have
suggested that callers worried about privacy at least send in a
partially completed form because ''it's better than throwing it in
the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I urge people to complete the whole form,'' said Rep. Dan
Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Government Reform
subcommittee on the census. ''But there are some people that are
legitimately concerned about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Libertarian Party national director Steve Dasbach,
want the census to be reduced to a postcard that asks for a
person's name, address and how many people live in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Virginia Beach, Snead understands the Census Bureau's
point of view, but does not sympathize.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were in the statistics business, I would want this
information, too,'' he said. But if a census worker knocks on his
door for more information, ''I'll just politely say 'I'm sorry.'
I'm not going to do it.''

<HEADLINE> South Koreans Battle Animal Disease  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAJU, South Korea (AP) -- Still struggling to contain the spread
of foot-and-mouth disease in a village north of Seoul, South Korean
officials on Saturday reported a new outbreak of the deadly
livestock illness 90 miles farther south.
</P>
<P>
   In a special announcement shortly before midnight Saturday, the
Agriculture Ministry said that ''some'' cows at Hongsong, 60 miles
south of Seoul, showed symptoms of the disease and were immediately
quarantined. Ministry officials declined to disclose further
details, saying they will make a formal announcement early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   SBS-TV, quoting farmers in Hongsong, said 40 to 50 milk cows at
two farms were found to have severe blisters in their mouths and
that government veterinarians tentatively diagnosed it as
''quasi-hoof and mouth disease.'' Authorities set up roadblocks and
prohibited the movement of all villagers and animals within six
miles of the infected farms, SBS-TV said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the distance between the two affected areas, government
officials feared that the highly contagious disease might already
have spread extensively.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mad cow disease, which is believed to cause a
brain-wasting ailment in humans, foot-and-mouth disease cannot be
passed on to consumers. But it can ruin entire beef and milk cow
herds. The highly contagious virus causes fever and blisters on the
feet and mouths, sapping animals' appetites and causing weight loss
and possibly death.
</P>
<P>
   The last outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Asia occurred in
Taiwan in 1997, when ranchers were forced to destroy 3.6 million
pigs -- more than 80 percent of the nation's hog population.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean scare began last week when 15 cows in a small village
near Paju, 30 miles north of Seoul, collapsed with symptoms of the
disease. Health authorities moved in, burning down barns and
slaughtering all 105 head of cattle in Kumpa village.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, soldiers set up roadblocks on all roads leading to
Paju and checked vehicles and travelers. All vehicles moving in and
out of the area were forced to roll slowly across thick spongy rugs
doused with chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Weary farmers kept 24-hour guard, blocking off the entrances to
their villages and washing down each car with a chemical solution
before letting it through. A gaggle of girls returning from school
dutifully stepped on the wet rugs and cleaned the soles of their
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The contaminated village near Paju was cordoned off Saturday.
Plumes of smoke spiraled in the clear blue sky as soldiers wearing
chemical warfare outfits trundled wheelbarrows full of hay out to a
burn site, destroying it in case it had come in contact with the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a life-or-death matter for us. Our whole livelihood
depends on it,'' said cattle farmer Yoo Chong-kyu, 40.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States, Japan, Australia and Taiwan moved to
suspend imports of South Korean dairy products, the government said
Friday it was willing to slaughter 350,000 head of livestock within
a 12-mile radius of the farms in Paju.
</P>
<P>
   The government plans to buy the meat of the slaughtered
livestock or reimburse farmers who have to sell their meat at lower
prices. The meat will be sold in domestic markets because it is not
infected, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Colleges Hit by Faculty Retirements  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN STOCUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bob Wiley listened to the ideas of
younger, visiting professors, heard about their research projects
and knew he was closing in on retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It involves so many new and different techniques and ideas
that I have a hard time relating to,'' said Wiley, 65, who retired
in January from the University of Iowa College of Pharmacy. ''I
think the science that I would have to offer is kind of dated, and
it's not fair to expose students to science that's not really
first-class.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1950s and early '60, when the Cold War drove the
government to pump money into research and Baby Boomers started
enrolling in college, Wiley was one of the many beneficiaries of
the large-scale hiring of college professors.
</P>
<P>
   Now, those professors are starting to retire, and the trend is
being felt nationwide, said Iris Molotsky, a spokeswoman for the
Washington-based American Association of University Professors.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the retirees is being complicated by the budget crunch
of the late 1980s and early '90s, in which many schools had to
impose hiring and promotion freezes, Molotsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just don't have the same number of people to step in and
fill the shoes,'' she said. ''That's a problem in a lot of
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The School of Arts and Sciences at the private University of
Richmond in Virginia is losing nearly 10 percent of its
approximately 190 professors to retirement at the end of this
academic year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're losing a lot of the long-term loyalty, that's not
insignificant,'' said David Leary, dean of the school.
</P>
<P>
   At Iowa State University in Ames, half of the more than 1,400
professors are 50 or older and 16 percent are 60 or older.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the next decade, we are going to be facing a replacement of
a significant number of faculty,'' Iowa State Provost Rollin
Richmond said.
</P>
<P>
   Finding replacements isn't his only concern. New faculty members
will need to establish their research.
</P>
<P>
   ''For some areas in science, that can amount to several hundreds
of thousands of dollars over a two- or three-year period to get
them going so that they become competitive,'' Richmond said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, said Aaron Podolefsky, provost of the
University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, new professors are
''freshly educated, out of graduate school and they have seen the
newest in technologies. ... There's a lot of new excitement, a lot
of new ideas.''

<HEADLINE> Quiet Media Angers Venezuelan Leader  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA OLSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Journalists protesting what they said
were Hugo Chavez's attacks on the media refused to ask the
Venezuelan leader any questions during a presidential news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   A visibly angered Chavez stormed out of the room in silence.
</P>
<P>
   The incident Friday in north central Venezuela underscored
concerns about freedom of the press in the South American nation,
as well as growing opposition to Chavez as May's presidential
balloting approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of asking questions, one reporter stood up, looked
directly at Chavez, and told him why they were protesting.
</P>
<P>
   ''In view of your repeatedly disrespectful attitude, and your
assessment of our questions as irrelevant, we, as serious
professionals of the media ... have decided not to pose any
questions this afternoon,'' local radio journalist Amira Muci told
Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Her words left the usually longwinded Chavez speechless.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was visibly annoyed. He said nothing and, in silence,
quickly went across the street where leaders of his party were
waiting for him,'' Muci said later.
</P>
<P>
   The group of about 20 journalists agreed to stage the protest
moments before Chavez's plane landed in the central Venezuelan city
of Maracay, said Jairo Marquez, a reporter for Maracay's El Siglo
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has not attempted to shut down any media outlets. But his
frequent verbal assaults on the media have alienated prominent
journalists who say he's trying to intimidate them.
</P>
<P>
   A new constitution that Chavez pushed through last year contains
a controversial clause requiring the media to publish ''truthful
information,'' which the Inter-American Press Association has said
could lead to censorship.
</P>
<P>
   A leftist former army paratrooper who staged a failed 1992 coup
attempt, Chavez has enjoyed almost fanatical support from
Venezuela's poor majority.
</P>
<P>
   But he faces serious opposition for the first time from a
popular ex-governor and fellow former coup leader, Francisco Arias,
who recently broke with Chavez. Arias is challenging Chavez in the
May 28 election and is thought to have a chance at victory.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has accused journalists of ''manipulating'' his words and
complained that the media refuses to publish his frequent
announcements of new social and economic programs.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised address to announce housing and construction
plans shortly before the incident in Maracay, he called reporters
''professional deceivers'' and warned Venezuelans to ''unchain
themselves from the dictatorship they represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias applauded the journalists for conducting the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is positive that the president feels that not
everyone is willing to tolerate his insults and abuses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel, a former journalist
himself, has dismissed accusations that Chavez is trying to bully
the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the media are against Chavez. And not one reporter has
been arrested, harassed or silenced,'' Rangel said in a recent
television interview.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy over negative press coverage, Chavez created his own
daily newspaper last July called The President's Post, which lists
him as editor in chief.

<HEADLINE> Renowned Folk Singer McCurdy Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ed McCurdy, a leading 1950s folk music figure
whose songs were recorded by Johnny Cash, Arlo Guthrie and Joan
Baez, has died. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   McCurdy died March 23 in Halifax, Novia Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   McCurdy, the son of a farmer, left his home in Willow Hill, Pa.,
for New York and a singing career at age 18. After a failed bid at
becoming a Frank Sinatra-style nightclub singer, McCurdy turned to
folk music during the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, he headlined a series of shows at New York's Village
Vanguard and released his first album, ''Ed McCurdy Sings Songs of
the Canadian Maritimes.'' He later signed a deal with Elektra
Records, where he collaborated with another influential folk
singer, Ramblin' Jack Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, his songs were recorded by a variety of artists that
included Cash, Guthrie, Baez, Pete Seeger, and Simon and Garfunkel.
</P>
<P>
   After his music career waned, McCurdy moved to Nova Scotia in
1984 and became a character actor on Canadian television dramas.

<HEADLINE> More troubled kids need help, Whitman offers plan  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- They tried everything -- counseling, child
study teams, anger management courses.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one night, in desperation and fear, the Monmouth County
parents called the police. Their teen-age son was threatening to
kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was in a rage,'' remembers his mother ''Mary,'' who asked
that her real name not be used to protect her son's privacy. ''He
took a knife and put it to himself, so they arrested him, and they
did me a favor because then the system kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   ''We refused to let him come home,'' she adds. ''We told the
judge we were afraid of our own son.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy stayed in detention for about two months while a
psychiatric team evaluated him. The team finally decided he needed
to be in a South Jersey treatment program that is like a wilderness
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the boy is making progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's in the best place that's available out there,''
said his mother.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like an extreme step -- to call the police on your own
child. But it happens frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of disturbed children often have nowhere else to turn.
Insurance coverage for mental health is quickly exhausted. Schools
and pediatricians offer little help, parents say. And the children
get sicker and sicker.
</P>
<P>
   So parents call the cops. Or they call the state Division of
Youth and Family Services, which is supposed to help abused
children but also ends up dealing with children who have severe
mental health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has to reach such a horrible point before you can find
help,'' said Bonnie, a Monmouth County parent whose teen-age
daughter tried to commit suicide twice.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with increasing pressure on state systems, Gov. Christie
Whitman now wants to help.
</P>
<P>
   She has proposed a $206 million children's initiative that is
supposed to turn the state's fragmented service system into
one-stop shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The new system will, in theory, provide the right help for each
troubled child and teen. There will be a special agency to call.
That agency will create individual treatment plans and then provide
the programs the child needs.
</P>
<P>
   Services will stretch across state departments, so kids can get
help no matter which agency they come to first. And parents will
find the support they need to cope.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   Children are showing up with more severe mental or emotional
problems than ever before, experts say. They're violent,
confrontational and frightened. They won't listen. They refuse to
go to school. They try to kill themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it stems from child abuse. Some of it is mental illness.
But experts also say more kids are growing up alone, with parents
who are either on drugs or always at work.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing more difficult children in the services that we
provide,'' says Richard Mingoia, president of Youth Consultation
Services, which has more than 70 youth treatment programs in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''It comes from feeling very much alone and abandoned in the
world,'' he explains. ''They figure, you really can't rely on
anybody, so why should you care about anybody else?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some parents say all they do is care -- and it gets them
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shirley'' has spent two years trying to get help for her
15-year-old daughter, who tried to commit suicide when she was 13.
</P>
<P>
   She has consulted pediatricians, psychiatrists, psychologists,
child study teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''The school was as in the dark as we were,'' says Shirley, who
also asked that her real name not be used. ''She needs to be in
some type of program. But there's no one to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman says her plan will eventually solve that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which is included in the proposed budget that
starts in July, the state would add $39 million in new state and
federal funding to the $167 million already spent on services for
disturbed youth. Over the next four years, funding would increase
to $280 million. Lawmakers still have to approve the spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year, between $8 million and $12 million would be
used to hire a company to administer the program, much like a
managed care agency, according to Laurie Facciarossa, spokeswoman
for the state Department of Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   That agency could look across all state-funded programs and
services to decide what is best for each child.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for creating county agencies that would
manage care for the most troubled children. Those county agencies
could dip into ''flexible'' pots of money that can be used for any
service a child needs, state officials promise.
</P>
<P>
   Mingoia says Whitman's proposal has some strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Pooling funding and providing a central agency to handle cases
is a good idea, he says. And, if the Whitman administration can
accomplish the difficult task of getting state departments to work
together, it would help a lot of kids.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'm not sure there's enough money in it to really do what
they want to do,'' said Mingoia. ''You're increasing the number of
people who will be served.''
</P>
<P>
   He also questions whether it's a good idea to have a managed
care type agency handle the cases. State officials promise the
agency will have no financial incentive to deny services, as many
managed care agencies do.
</P>
<P>
   But Mingoia says that could change if the agency realizes it
lacks funds to pay for needed services.
</P>
<P>
   ''When push comes to shove, if there isn't enough money in the
system, is the managed care agency going to reduce access?'' he
wonders. ''Or are kids going to have to fail in less expensive
programs before going into more expensive ones that would work?''
</P>

drug-addicted youth.

<HEADLINE> Camden Mayor's indictment another body blow for reeling city  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- The rolls of toilet paper in the bathroom
stalls at Camden City Hall are padlocked to prevent them from being
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is entirely unintentional in a building in which
federal authorities say just about everything else was up for
grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment last week of Mayor Milton Milan on corruption
charges linking him to the Philadelphia mob was just the latest
body blow absorbed by this already-reeling city of 87,000 that for
years has been New Jersey's poorest and most troubled. It is the
fifth-poorest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the little city that couldn't. Try as it might, this
once-proud industrial powerhouse just across the Delaware River
from Philadelphia can't shake off decades of decline that have made
its name synonymous with urban blight.
</P>
<P>
   Milan's indictment fits an all-too-familiar pattern that has
frustrated Camden residents for years: Just when it seems that good
things are starting to happen, along comes something awful to
shatter the city's fragile civic pride.
</P>
<P>
   The state chooses Camden as the spot for the New Jersey State
Aquarium, but 133 fires are set by arsonists on the night before
Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   A state-of-the-art concert hall opens on the city's waterfront,
but 60 people are murdered in the nine-square-mile city that year.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy ends a long tug-of-war by awarding the historic
battleship U.S.S. New Jersey to Camden as a floating museum, but
the mayor begs the state to take over Camden's school system, which
a judge refers to as ''a swamp of mediocrity and ...
incompetence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Camden High School basketball team wins the state
championship, but a week and a half later, the third Camden mayor
out of the last five is hauled before a judge on criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take two steps forward and two steps back, and end up right
where we started,'' said Frank Fulbrook, president of the
Cooper-Grant Neighborhood Association and Milan's opponent in the
1997 mayoral election. ''This sure doesn't help things.''
</P>
<P>
   Milan is charged with bribery, conspiracy, extortion, money
laundering and fraud. Federal prosecutors say he received cash,
vacation trips, dinners, automobiles and home improvements from
former Philadelphia mob boss Ralph Natale and his associates in the
hope of getting city contracts in return.
</P>
<P>
   Natale has been cooperating with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, 37, maintains his innocence, and calls the indictment a
politically motivated prosecution aimed at ousting the city's first
Hispanic mayor from the $75,000-a-year post. He's free on $150,000
bail.
</P>
<P>
   David Solares, who works in a pizza parlor across the street
from City Hall, grew up with Milan and doesn't believe the charges
against him are true.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went to high school with him. I know him and his wife,
Kathy, for 18 years,'' he said. ''I've seen him and his (police)
officers out in the streets bringing in drug dealers. Since he
became mayor, I haven't seen drugs as much in this city. Before,
you'd see (dealers) on the corners. If they take him out of office,
drugs will come back worse, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Milan's name repeatedly surfaced in the trial of two men,
Jose Rivera, his childhood pal, and Luis ''Tun Tun'' Figueroa, who
were convicted of running the city's largest cocaine ring ever.
Five convicted dealers testified that Milan sold $20 bags of
cocaine and purchased the drug by the kilo before becoming mayor.
</P>
<P>
   That has resident Sharon Taylor furious.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he belongs in jail, for sure,'' she said. ''If they
don't do something about him, kids that are out there selling drugs
will think, 'Hey, I can deal drugs and then become mayor, and I'll
be set for life.' I don't want my kids thinking like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble has been Camden's constant companion for decades;
indeed, the official history of Camden on the city's web site ends
at around 1920. Incorporated in 1829, Camden used to be one of the
nation's mightiest industrial hubs. The first picture tubes for
television sets were made here by the Radio Corporation of America.
</P>
<P>
   Camden was known for its shipbuilding, carriage-making,
sausage-manufacturing and iron works, and it had the country's only
nickel plant in the early 1860s, providing metal to the U.S. Mint
for the manufacture of coins.
</P>
<P>
   But after World War II, industry began moving elsewhere, and
with it went a third of the city's population. Camden got steadily
poorer, and the only significant reminder of its industrial past is
the Campbell Soup Co., which still has its world headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 census figures paint a depressing portrait of Camden,
where the median income was $17,386, and the average house was
worth $31,300. More than 3,500 housing units stood vacant, and
1,400 were boarded up.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30,600 residents were classified as living below the
federal poverty level, and 56 houses were still heated by coal; 189
had no heating systems at all, and 530 lacked complete plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   State monitors oversee the city's finances and its police
department, and are close to taking control of its 34 schools. The
city has trouble collecting taxes, adopting timely municipal
budgets and staying within state-mandated debt limits, and relies
more on state financial aid -- 75 percent of its budget -- than any
other city in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS, drug addiction, homelessness and crime are serious
problems here, and the city and Camden County last year sued the
gun industry to recoup the costs of gun violence in the county,
where 30 people died from gunshot wounds in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   With such gloomy statistics, is it any wonder tobacco shop owner
Joseph Twardy is embarrassed to tell people where he lives?
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the worst reputation in the country,'' he said.
''Hell, it can't go no lower. I was in Florida and told people I
was from Camden, and they said, 'You can't walk the streets there;
you'll get killed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Twardy campaigned for Milan in 1997, but now regrets his former
support. After Milan's predecessor, Arnold Webster, pleaded guilty
to illegally paying himself $20,000 in school district funds after
he stopped working as superintendent and became mayor, Twardy
thought Milan would be a reformer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought a new broom sweeps clean,'' he said. ''But he swept
City Hall clean into his own pocket. We go from bad to worse
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Camden Mayor, Angelo Errichetti, who served from 1973 to
1981, spent 32 months in jail following his conviction in the
Abscam scandal. He accepted a $50,000 bribe from an undercover
F.B.I. agent.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Douglass owns a hot dog stand on Market Street, a block from
City Hall, and dreams of succeeding in Camden.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of opportunity in Camden,'' he said. ''My
partner and I just got another hot dog cart, and eventually I'd
like to open up a restaurant and maybe a billiards hall here.
</P>
<P>
   ''But things are up in the air right now,'' he said. ''Camden's
going to be at a standstill for the next three to five years. We're
going to be idle, just trying to clean up this mess.''

<HEADLINE> Elian's Classmates May Come to U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- ''Washington is up there, in the sky,''
the 6-year-old tells his classmates, pointing toward the ceiling of
their classroom. Most of them collapse in giggles.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 first graders, classmates of Elian Gonzalez, are
preparing for the biggest adventure of their short lives: to travel
on an official Cuban government tour to the U.S. capital to pick up
their absent friend.
</P>
<P>
   It still remains unclear if the trip will come off.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials have been put off by the communist
government's proposal to send a dozen of the boy's classmates with
his father to spend as long as a month or more in the United
States. The idea is to make Elian feel as comfortable and loved as
possible while an appeal by his Miami relatives plays itself out in
the federal court appellate system.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not yet applied for the visas for the
schoolchildren, Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National
Assembly, told The Associated Press on Friday. Plans also call for
Alarcon to go on the trip as an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But if the children do get the visas, they're ready.
</P>
<P>
   Their parents have given their consent. Each child has visited
the doctor and dentist, and has received clothes, a suitcase, a
toothbrush and other items for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going, we are all going, to get him and to put him on the
plane,'' Elian's best friend and deskmate Hanser Muniz, 6, said as
he sat in the classroom in Cardenas, a two-hour drive east of
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   He and the other children worry about Elian, who hadn't yet
learned all his letters and was still unable to count to 20 when he
was discovered floating in an inner tube off the coast of Florida
last November. They wonder if he has been able to learn those
things at his school in Miami, if he is confused by lessons in
English.
</P>
<P>
   All are sure he will come back someday and are saving his seat
for him. ''This desk is untouchable,'' read the letters on a white
cloth draped on his little school desk.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people including Elian's mother, who was divorced from
his father, died when their boat sank during the illegal crossing
from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's Miami relatives, who were given temporary custody of
the child after the accident, are fighting to keep him in the
United States, saying they can give him a better life off the
communist island.
</P>
<P>
   But Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is demanding his
parental rights and fighting to return the child to his homeland.
Last week, President Fidel Castro announced that the father was
ready to travel to the United States to claim his boy as soon as
U.S. officials give assurances that he would be given custody.
</P>
<P>
   The father, accompanied by 30 others including the first
graders, would stay with Elian in the United States during the
federal court appeal, Castro said. Each member of the entourage
would be ''indispensable'' in helping Elian readapt to his former
life in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But there are obstacles to this plan.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, has refused to
sign a promise to officials of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service that he will surrender Elian if he and his family lose
their court battle.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Elian's classmates in Cardenas said authorities
approached them two weeks ago about the possibility of the trip,
asking them not to tell their sons and daughters until plans were
firm. All interviewed by the AP said they supported sending their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a trip like Elian's trip ... in a bad boat,'' said
Ada Gonzalez, mother of 6-year-old Reynaldo. ''They will be very
well taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Like mothers everywhere, they worry they will miss their little
ones. Or that their children will grow homesick. But they see the
trip as a great opportunity for their boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a mission I cannot undertake,'' said Susana Fernandez,
whose son Jonny is among the children chosen for the trip. ''Since
I cannot go, I would like him to be able to.''

<HEADLINE> Dixie Chicks' Song Stirs Debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Dixie Chicks has some people steamed over
its new country single about two women who kill an abusive husband.
</P>
<P>
   ''Goodbye Earl'' is stirring a debate over whether the record
sheds light on the problem of domestic violence or condones a
murder by the abused victim.
</P>
<P>
   In the song, the wife poisons her abusive husband's black-eyed
peas.
</P>
<P>
   Some radio programmers are airing the single less frequently
than might be expected of a new song from the popular trio, the Los
Angeles Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lon Helton, country music editor for Radio &AMP; Records, said about
20 of 149 country stations that the trade newspaper tracks are
still not playing it.
</P>
<P>
   ''My question is, what do we do a song about next: school
shootings?'' remarked John Pellegrini, program director of York,
Pa., station WGTY-FM, which is not playing the record.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw said Sony Nashville and
Monument Records officials were reluctant to release it as a single
when the album came out, but relented once the trio decided to sing
it at the Grammys.

<HEADLINE> Mags Rewarded for Anti-Drug Stance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House drug policy office offered
financial incentives to at least six magazines that ran stories
discouraging drug use, an arrangement similar to one with
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   The drug office and the publications say there were never any
attempts to influence the content of articles. Under the deal with
the networks, which drew public attention earlier this year,
programs that carried anti-drug messages could be exempted from
requirements to run anti-drug ads.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen G. Smith, editor of U.S. News &AMP; World Report, one of the
six named in a report by the online magazine Salon, told The
Associated Press that people on the editorial side were ''utterly
ignorant of any kind of arrangement or even the hint of any kind of
arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that an article in the January issue of the magazine
questioned the propriety of television networks including anti-drug
themes in entertainment shows in exchange for public service
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Salon reported that The Sporting News, Family Circle, Seventeen,
Parade and USA Weekend also made use of the arrangement that gave
them financial credits worth thousands of dollars in ad space they
owed the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been open about this from the beginning,'' Bob Weiner,
spokesman for White House drug policy director Barry McCaffrey,
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was ''no attempt and no action that dictates any
content control whatsoever.'' The magazines' editorial sides were
unaware of, and played no role in, negotiations between the
office's ad agency that bought ad space and their sales
departments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1997 approved a $1 billion program to buy anti-drug
ads in the national media. As part of the legislation, the media
were required to match every spot bought by the government with a
free one. The agreements with the networks and magazines reduced
their public service obligations when they carry anti-drug messages
in their shows or articles.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News publisher Bill Holiber said in an interview that
dealings with the drug office occurred before he started his job in
January. He said the magazine no longer got ads from the office
because it was against the magazine's policy to link editorial
content to financial incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Holiber said U.S. News never submitted articles for review, but
the ad agency representing the drug office looked at articles on
its own to see if they met the criteria for exemptions. He said
articles in the publication never qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Revelations the drug office reviewed programs such shows as
''ER'' and ''The Practice'' raised concerns of government
interference in editorial independence.
</P>
<P>
   In January the White House announced new guidelines making clear
that it would not review program episodes for ad credits until
after they have been aired or published.

Clinton Urges Census Compliance
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton summoned all Americans today to make
their presence felt by completing this year's census forms completely and
accurately. ''Those who suggest that filling out your census form isn't
essential are plainly wrong,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address. ''An
inaccurate census distorts our understanding of a community's needs.'' Today is
Census Day, April 1, the once-in-a-decade day on which Americans are asked to
tell the government who and where they are. Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman
of the House Republican Conference, said Republicans share the goal of a full

Americans today not to politicize the case of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez and said
that the boy's father should have the right to speak for him. Reno, who favors
returning the boy to his father in Cuba, spoke during a discussion on
international law at the University of Virginia Law School. Her comments came

Quiet Media Angers Venezuelan Leader

   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Journalists protesting what they said were Hugo

of the room in silence. The incident yesterday in north central Venezuela
underscored concerns about freedom of the press in the South American nation, as
well as growing opposition to Chavez as May's presidential balloting approaches.
Unhappy over negative press coverage, Chavez created his own daily newspaper
last July called The President's Post, which lists him as editor in chief.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The late John F. Kennedy Jr.'s loft apartment could soon be
in the hands of actor Edward Burns. Burns, 32, has negotiated a deal to buy the
posh penthouse in New York's trendy Tribeca neighborhood for less than the
reported minimum $2.5 million asking price, both the Daily News and the New York
Post reported today. Burns, who has appeared in such films as ''Saving Private

<HEADLINE> War Vets Battle Zimbabwe Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HARTNACK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Long-simmering political tensions
erupted into violence Saturday when veterans of Zimbabwe's
independence war attacked protesters opposed to President Robert
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   The attack in downtown Harare came as Mugabe struggles to retain
his 20-year hold on power. Opposition against Mugabe has grown amid
recent illegal takeovers of white-owned farms, economic
mismanagement, shortages and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Police first tried to prevent the legal demonstration and then
initially stood by as the 3,500 protesters were bloodied with
whips, clubs, rocks and bricks. It wasn't until late Saturday that
calm returned to the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300 veterans of the bush war that led to Zimbabwe's
independence from Britain in 1980 appeared to single out whites
among the protesters. An elderly white couple was battered to the
ground and then kicked while police stood by.
</P>
<P>
   In London, British foreign office minister Peter Hain denounced
the ''thuggery orchestrated from on high.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 people were badly hurt in the attack by the
pro-Mugabe war veterans, said Brian Kagoro, a spokesman for the
National Constitutional Assembly, which organized the protest
march. Hospital officials said one elderly man was in serious
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I put the blame squarely on the police for what happened,''
said businessman Richard Calder, who was cut and bruised. ''We were
attacked by these so-called war heroes while the police did nothing
to control the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was called to protest the takeover of more
than 700 white-owned farms by squatters led by black war veterans.
Opposition leaders say Mugabe is refusing to have his security
forces obey a court order for the squatters' eviction because he
wants to gain popular support ahead of parliamentary elections,
which could be called in May.
</P>
<P>
   Police brandishing batons, shields and riot guns -- their
greatest show of force since eight people were killed in food riots
in 1998 -- ringed the capital with roadblocks and tried to prevent
demonstrators from gathering by turning back vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified senior policeman snatched a judge's order that
authorized the protest march from a demonstrator and threw it onto
the pavement. Two National Constitutional Assembly leaders --
architect Michael Pearce and journalist Grace Kwinjeh -- were
detained when they complained about the policeman's actions.
</P>
<P>
   After initially standing by, police fired tear gas at the mixed
group of demonstrators and war veterans in central Harare's African
Unity Square as air force helicopters swooped over the city.
</P>
<P>
   None of the ex-guerrillas was reported arrested. State media
claimed the protesters sparked the clash when they moved toward the
headquarters of the ruling ZANU-PF party, which ''provoked the war
veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   But witnesses said the ex-guerrillas clearly were the aggressors
and that the trouble started a mile from the party headquarters.
Hain, the British official, said he would raise the matter
personally with Mugabe at a summit of African and European leaders
due to start Monday in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe's second-largest city, Bulawayo, another protest
march with 4,000 demonstrators proceeded peacefully Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Man Accused of Locking Mom in Closet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- A man is accused of locking his mother
in a closet in her own home for three days and beating her with a
belt because she wouldn't give him money.
</P>
<P>
   David Parks, 35, also threatened to cut off his mother's toes,
gave her a garbage bag to use as a toilet and fed her nothing but
stale popcorn, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   L. Michaeleen Parks, 59, was treated at a hospital for cuts and
bruises and released, Sgt. Bruce Elrod said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the ordeal began Monday when Michaeleen Parks
refused to give her son money for his rent, saying he would have to
wait until she was paid at the end of the week. Parks also was
upset that his mother had put her husband in a nursing home,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Parks realized his mother needed medical help, but
rather than attracting attention by going to a hospital he took her
to a beauty salon where a friend works, police said. The friend
took Parks to a drugstore, allowing Michaeleen Parks to call
police.
</P>
<P>
   Parks was charged with first-degree kidnapping and willful
injury. Bail was set at $100,000.

<HEADLINE> European Leaders Meet With Africans  </HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- European and African nations bickered
Saturday during preparations for a landmark summit, indicating that
old hurts and divisions may overcome hoped-for goodwill at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural Africa-European Union summit, which will be on
Monday and Tuesday, is meant to raise international awareness of
Africa's potential and plight, promote its integration into the
global economy and develop peace and democracy in the region. The
event is being viewed by some as a largely symbolic show of unity
following a century of colonialism and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   However, some African nations warned Saturday that they would
not accept any domineering tone when Europeans raise human rights
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We as Arabs, Muslims and Africans care more than others about
human rights because man is sacred for us and we are not waiting
for others to lecture us on fields of human rights and democracy,''
said Ali al-Treiki, Libya's minister of African affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Britain however, said it planned to do just that by raising
Zimbabwe's treatment of white protesters opposed to President
Robert Mugabe, which British foreign office minister Peter Hain has
denounced as ''thuggery orchestrated from on high.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is clear evidence of racist, anti-white attacks, which
is especially disturbing coming from a party which came to power 20
years ago on a tide of anti-racist sentiment,'' said Peter Hain,
the British Foreign Office minister of state.
</P>
<P>
   EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten said the summit
should keep no issues under the carpet. ''I hope the summit will
promote realistic, frank and high-level dialogue,'' Patten said.
</P>
<P>
   The Africans want the summit to focus on debt relief, increasing
foreign investment and better trade terms. Besides human rights,
the European Union wants to talk about democracy, rule of law and
clean government as conditions for cooperation with Africa.
Priorities include such conversation topics as arms and drug
trafficking, refugees and illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Another cloud over the meeting was a report in Germany that a
terrorism suspect planned to name Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi as
having ordered a 1975 attack on an OPEC oil ministers' conference
in Vienna. Three people were killed in that attack.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the German newspaper report here, al-Treiki
just shrugged his shoulders and refused to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi is already in Egypt and is expected to use the summit to
try to improve relations with the 15 European Union nations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, African diplomats argued over which heads of state
would have the right to address the meeting. The disagreement
mainly centered on Libya's insistence that Gadhafi speak about
Africa's grievances. Other countries resisted, concerned he would
use the platform to deliver a diatribe against the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure everyone wants to represent the continent in a
dignified way,'' said top Algerian diplomat Smail Chergui.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen EU heads of state and at least 20 leaders of Africa's 53
countries are expected to attend. Somalia was not invited because
it does not have a recognized government and the remaining
countries will send other top leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Non-governmental organizations said a parallel meeting on Sunday
to highlight corruption and human rights abuses in Africa had been
banned by Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   A network of European and African human rights groups plan to
issue a written plea to summit participants Tuesday demanding
increased European aid to Africa as a ''symbolic compensation for
the injustices of colonization,'' the Cairo Institute for Human
Rights Studies, a local think tank, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It said the groups will also ask Europe to publicly apologize to
the African people for the colonization.
</P>
<P>
   French president Jacques Chirac is expected to use the summit to
raise the issue of Africa's debt burden, with some nations having
to spend more on annual debt servicing than on education and health
combined. How to address that remains one of the issues still open
for discussion Sunday when the EU and African foreign ministers
meet to iron out the final differences ahead of the summit.

<HEADLINE> Wade Sworn In As Senegalese Leader  </HEADLINE>
By CHIKELUBA KENECHUKU, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- Longtime opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade
was sworn in as president of Senegal on Saturday, ending the
40-year rule of one party here.
</P>
<P>
   About 80,000 people filled the national stadium in the capital,
Dakar. They cheered wildly and chanted ''sopi'' -- ''change'' in the
Wolof language.
</P>
<P>
   ''My election has opened up a new era, that of democratic
change,'' Wade said after he was sworn in by the president of the
constitutional court. ''Henceforth the people of Africa will know
that democratic change is possible and will fight for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The election was a rare peaceful and democratic power transfer
on a continent plagued by election fraud, coups and civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Abdou Diouf, who came to power in 1981, did not
wait for the official results before conceding defeat to his rival
in a runoff ballot last month. Wade won 58.5 percent of the vote to
41.5 percent for Diouf.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Saturday's ceremony, thousands of excited spectators
flooded the field to try to get a better view of the proceedings.
Security officials, who initially fought back spectators with
batons, eventually gave up and allowed them to fill the field. At
least 10 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, which was attended by six African heads of
state, Diouf received Wade at the presidential palace, where he
formally handed over power.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal, with a population of 10 million in an area about the
size of South Dakota, has had a reputation as one of Africa's most
stable nations and one of the few to hold regular elections. But
bitter poverty remains. Nearly two-thirds of the West African
nation's population is illiterate, hospitals and roads are badly
neglected and unemployment is increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Diouf's Socialist Party had ruled since independence from France
in 1960, and Wade had warned of a popular revolt if Diouf had won a
fourth term.

   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton today opposed Congressional
action to make Elian Gonzalez a resident of this country, putting her at odds
with Vice President Al Gore. ''Hillary Clinton knows that we must take politics
out of this decision,'' said Clinton Senate campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson.
''Elian's future should be determined as quickly as possible through the
appropriate, ongoing legal process.'' Clinton's position on Elian also put her
at odds with New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Giuliani, who maintains that
the boy should be granted U.S. citizenship and that any custody issues should be

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged Americans today to make their

Clinton said in his weekly radio address. ''An inaccurate census distorts our
understanding of a community's needs.'' Today is Census Day, April 1, the
once-in-a-decade day on which Americans are asked to tell the government who and
where they are. Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican
Conference, said Republicans share the goal of a full and accurate census count,
but ''millions of Americans'' have concerns about privacy.

people dead and tore apart this Central African nation. State-run Radio Rwanda,
the only national broadcaster, called on listeners to mark the event with public
discussions and remembrance. More than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically
moderate Hutus were killed in the 1994 genocide, most slaughtered with machetes,
hoes and other makeshift weapons. The week of mourning will culminate in a

<HEADLINE> Westfield cop hits a homer in lifelong dream tryout  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) -- As lifelong dreams go, Ed Belford's was
pretty tame. Oh sure, he's envisioned himself as a pro baseball
player under the lights on a hot summer night with thousands of
fans in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   But his dream wasn't to hit the home run to win the World Series
in his last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to be out there playing shortstop, having a
ground ball hit to me with one out and one on in the ninth inning,
start a double-play and send everyone home happy,'' said the
Fanwood resident, who's a police officer in nearby Westfield.
</P>
<P>
   And so Saturday, after decades of wondering what might have
been, Belford, at 42, took the field at Somerset Ballpark with
about 100 hopefuls, most of them half his age. Each was trying to
win a walk-on job with the minor league Somerset Patriots of the
independent Atlantic League. The league's Newark Bears also held
open tryouts Saturday, and the Atlantic City Surf will do so on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Three years away from retiring from the police force and with a
15-year-old son playing high school baseball, Belford was better
suited to be a coach than a player. But he said he had to at least
try.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always wanted to try out for a pro team,'' he said. ''I
haven't played since college, and my son is playing now, and I
always tell him to follow his dreams. Well, it's time I started
practicing what I preached.''
</P>
<P>
   He put his chances of making the team at ''zero.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Tomorrow, I'll be raking leaves in my back yard,'' he said.
''But today I'm a baseball player. And it's a lot of fun out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   After fielding a few grounders and taking dozens of throws from
erratic young outfielders, Belford shocked the stadium by being the
first one to blast a home run out of the ballpark, a shot that
cleared the left-field wall a good 320 to 330 feet from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   The other tryouts cheered for him, and for just a moment,
42-year-old Ed Belford was a baseball hero.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots general manager Dave Gasaway admitted the tryouts faced
long odds to win a contract with the team. And manager Sparky Lyle
noted the team can still select players from other teams in the
upcoming draft, making it even more difficult for a walk-on to
stick with the team.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, Jay Laub did just that, impressing the Pats
enough at an open tryout to earn a contract with the team. He hit
.239 in 37 games with Somerset before being traded to the Nashua
Pride in New Hampshire, where he finished the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of guys who sit in bars or in front of TVs and
say, 'Oh, I could do that,' '' Gasaway said. ''But these are the
guys who actually come out and do it, and I give them all the
credit in the world for putting their money where their mouth is.''
</P>
<P>
   One player who appeared to have a decent shot was 22-year-old
Adrian Acevedo of Orlando, Fla., who flew up on Thursday to try
out. He was drafted out of college by the Chicago White Sox in the
16th round of the 1997 draft, but never signed with the team. A
.350 hitter in two years of junior college in Miami and two at
North Carolina State, he caught Lyle's eye by running the
60-yard-dash in 6.6 seconds and making several strong throws from
deep in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Gasaway was negotiating with Acevedo late Saturday and hoped to
have him signed to a contract by Tuesday, barring any last-minute
snags.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just trying to continue my career any way possible,''
Acevedo said before the contract was offered. ''I know I can still
play, and I know there's a place somewhere for me to play. I just
have to find it. I'm going to keep playing baseball until somebody
kicks me off the field.''

<HEADLINE> Nurses' Strike Hits in Mass.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- A nurse's strike on Saturday forced a
hospital to postpone its long-planned move to a multimillion-dollar
new facility.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of nurses picketed for a second day and St. Vincent
Hospital officials said it was too difficult to go ahead with the
move during the chaos of the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital spokeswoman Paula Green said the move would be made
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses have been negotiating a new contract for more than
two years. They reached agreement on 3.5 percent annual raises.
</P>
<P>
   However, a final round of talks broke down Wednesday over
mandatory overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want tired nurses caring for critically ill patients,
because it's a dangerous situation,'' said nurse Susan Troccolo,
37, of Shrewsbury.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's owner, Tenet Healthcare System, the nation's
second-largest health care services chain with 122 hospitals,
bought the once Roman Catholic hospital in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Barbara, Calif.-based group reported a 23 percent
increase in profits for the quarter ending Feb. 29, compared to the
same period last year. Tenet attributed the increase in part to
declining labor costs and an increase in patient admissions.
</P>
<P>
   There were 150 patients in the hospital Saturday. State health
regulators said patient care was proceeding normally.

<HEADLINE> Clinton says Giuliani using 'right-wing venom machine' in campaign  </HEADLINE>
By GARRETT THEROLF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani of enlisting a ''right-wing venom machine''
against Hillary Rodham Clinton in their opposing campaigns for a
Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way they can win is to convince people that we're
space aliens,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to union workers at a fund-raiser for his wife's
campaign, Clinton said Giuliani has raised a ''double-ton of
money'' for his own race through his ties to the political far
right.
</P>
<P>
   He said people supporting the first lady and Vice President Al
Gore in his race for the White House are ''on the right side of
history.'' Giuliani and Gore's likely opponent in November, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, are not, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the New York mayor only as ''Hillary's opponent,''
Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a complicated deal, and that's why Hillary's
opponent can raise a double-ton of money besides being mayor and
having special relations with a lot of those people who have it in
New York. And you have the right-wing venom machine all-geared up
against her again.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Giuliani has raised about $19 million for his Senate
campaign, the first lady $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Giuliani's campaign spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum,
said: ''Mayor Giuliani's fund-raising success is an outgrowth of
the tremendous support he enjoys statewide, across a broad
cross-spectrum of New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said the comment about a venom machine hearkened back
to a television appearance by Hillary Clinton in January 1998,
early in the unraveling of the scandal that led to the president's
impeachment. She spoke on NBC's ''Today'' program of a ''vast
right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband
since the day he announced for president.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There they go again, invoking the vast right-wing
conspiracy,'' Teitelbaum said. ''Now where have we heard that one
before?''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Census Compliance  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton summoned all Americans on
Saturday to make their presence felt by completing this year's
census forms completely and accurately.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who suggest that filling out your census form isn't
essential are plainly wrong,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio
address. ''An inaccurate census distorts our understanding of a
community's needs, denies people their fair share of resources and
diminishes the quality of life not only for them but for all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''If we believe everybody in our community counts we
simply must make sure that that everyone is counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was Census Day, April 1, the once-in-a-decade day on
which Americans are asked to tell the government who and where they
are.
</P>
<P>
   This year's count is the 22nd national census since the first
count was conducted in 1790. In his presidential proclamation of
Census Day, Clinton declared the enumeration ''plays a crucial role
in helping us to maintain our democratic form of government.''
</P>
<P>
   In his radio remarks, he addressed the complaints of some
Republican leaders about the extensive questions posed by the long
census form, which goes to one of every six U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know Americans are concerned about their privacy, and that's
why I also want to stress that the information you provide is
strictly, absolutely confidential,'' Clinton said. ''Individual
information will not be available to anyone outside the Census
Bureau for any reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican
Conference, said Republicans share the goal of a full and accurate
census count.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate that some in President Clinton's party have
suggested otherwise and are trying to use the census to spread
misinformation and score political points,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   He nevertheless asserted that ''millions of Americans have
expressed an unprecedented level of concern for their privacy when
asked to complete the long form.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While it may be the shortest long form in history, it has
raised more questions than any of its predecessors,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush said Thursday
that he ''can understand why people don't want to give over that
information to the government. And if I have the long form, I'm not
sure I would either.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau sent questionnaires to the country's 115
million households in March. Officially they want to know how many
people are living and how they are living in each home on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the count is crucial to the nation's development
and well-being apart from its constitutional purpose of allocating
seats for each state in the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need the census to help decide how almost $200 billion in
federal funds will be invested in states and communities ... to
help our hometowns determine where to build everything from roads
to schools to hospitals to child care centers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said it is important that the long form be completed
accurately because it is ''critical for everything from helping
communities design mass transit systems to providing 911 emergency
services.'' Additionally, the data are used to calculate cost of
living increases for Social Security and military retirement and
other payments to veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though the census is taken only once a decade, it has an
impact on our lives every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Census Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt said the
agency has a response target of 61 percent of the 115 million forms
mailed out. ''Much less than that, and we have a huge task in front
of us'' contacting people who failed to mail forms back, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he has already completed his form and found ''it
only takes a few minutes.'' He said Vice President Al Gore filed
his on-line.

<HEADLINE> President Criticizes Giuliani  </HEADLINE>
By GARRETT THEROLF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani of enlisting a ''right-wing venom machine''
against Hillary Rodham Clinton in their opposing campaigns for a
Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way they can win is to convince people that we're
space aliens,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to union workers at a fund-raiser for his wife's
campaign, Clinton said Giuliani has raised a ''double-ton of
money'' for his own race through his ties to the political far
right.
</P>
<P>
   He said people supporting the first lady and Vice President Al
Gore in his race for the White House are ''on the right side of
history.'' Giuliani and Gore's likely opponent in November, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, are not, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the New York mayor only as ''Hillary's opponent,''
Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a complicated deal, and that's why Hillary's
opponent can raise a double-ton of money besides being mayor and
having special relations with a lot of those people who have it in
New York. And you have the right-wing venom machine all-geared up
against her again.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Giuliani has raised about $19 million for his Senate
campaign, the first lady $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Giuliani's campaign spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum,
said: ''Mayor Giuliani's fund-raising success is an outgrowth of
the tremendous support he enjoys statewide, across a broad
cross-spectrum of New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said the comment about a venom machine hearkened back
to a television appearance by Hillary Clinton in January 1998,
early in the unraveling of the scandal that led to the president's
impeachment. She spoke on NBC's ''Today'' program of a ''vast
right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband
since the day he announced for president.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There they go again, invoking the vast right-wing
conspiracy,'' Teitelbaum said. ''Now where have we heard that one
before?''
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money the first lady raised at Saturday's union
fund-raiser was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife standing behind him, Clinton told members of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers that both Giuliani
and Bush are gaining potentially controversial support

Protesters Oppose Returning Elian
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI, Fla. (AP) -- Even as U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno was appealing to
Americans not to further politicize the Elian Gonzalez case today, protesters
and politicians were scrambling for the bullhorn. The nonprofit group Cuban
Information Committee ran a full-page ad in The Miami Herald touting reasons why
Elian should stay in America, including claims that the boy, if returned, would
become a ''pawn in Castro's hands, a trophy he will display in his latest
victory over imperialism.'' The INS has threatened to revoke the boy's residency
status, but twice last week pushed back a deadline for the relatives to agree,
now set for 9 a.m. Tuesday.

Ugandan Death Toll Reaches 924
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Struggling with a lack of equipment after uncovering
a string of mass graves, police are regrouping before tackling yet another
compound where more victims of a doomsday cult may be buried. The death toll
from the mass killing now stands at 924, after police raised the number who died
when a cult church was set ablaze with hundreds of members sealed inside. Since
then, mass graves at three other compounds have uncovered more bodies. While
Ugandan authorities promised to apprehend the perpetrators of the stabbings,
burnings and stranglings, investigators showed no signs of being able to track
down sect leaders or even of being able to confirm which -- if any -- survived.

   GUDERMES, Russia (AP) -- After two days of scouring the hills for dozens of
comrades who disappeared in a deadly rebel ambush, Russian soldiers found 33 of
the missing men Saturday -- all but one dead, and many of them booby-trapped so
their bodies couldn't be retrieved. Six more servicemen were still missing in
the wake of Thursday's devastating attack on a convoy of 49 Interior Ministry
troops -- the latest in a series of Chechen rebel strikes that have inflicted
heavy losses on the Russians, demonstrating their vulnerability despite their
claims to control Chechnya.

Volcano Evacuees Fear Worst Ahead
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- Thousands of townspeople hunkered down on the hard wooden
floors of makeshift emergency shelters for yet another day Saturday as Mount Usu
sputtered with more bursts of ash and volcanic debris. Speedy orders to get
everyone out of danger areas well before Usu's first eruption won praise for the
government. But after four days in limbo, many evacuees feared the worst was
still ahead -- more volcanic spitting and weeks, perhaps months, away from their
homes. Authorities have reported no injuries or damage, but fears remained that
that Usu could spew a deadly mix of gas and rocks that incinerates everything in
its path.

picketed for a second day and St. Vincent Hospital officials said it was too
difficult to go ahead with the move during the chaos of the walkout. Hospital
spokeswoman Paula Green said the move would be made soon. The nurses have been
negotiating a new contract for more than two years. They reached agreement on
3.5 percent annual raises. However, a final round of talks broke down Wednesday

Poll: Keep Knight on the Job

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A poll shows that more than half of Indiana residents
feel University of Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight should keep his job. The
survey, sponsored by The Indianapolis Star and Indianapolis television station
WTHR, was produced by the Indiana University Center for Survey Research. Poll
respondents were asked about claims by former Indiana player Neil Reed that
Knight choked him a practice several years ago. The poll showed 55.5 percent
think Knight should continue as coach, and 38.9 percent said he should not. But
more than 44.5 percent feel the school should continue its current
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov. To Use $5B For Transit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis is poised to unveil a
$5 billion plan to help solve the state's traffic woes, the San
Francisco Chronicle reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan would use $2.8 billion in state funds and
$2.2 billion in bonds, which would need voter approval. The state's
commitment would be supplemented by $10 billion in federal and
local funds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's money, $4.5 billion, would go to
construction projects, while the rest would fund rehabilitation and
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Davis declined to comment on the plan, which was
expected to be announced Wednesday in Los Angeles and Thursday in
the San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm excited the governor is coming our way by engaging in a
pay-as-you-go plan instead of raising taxes, but we need to keep in
mind this is throwing a nickel at a problem that costs a dollar,''
Assembly Republican leader Scott Baugh of Huntington Beach told the
Chronicle. ''We need a long-term strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   One major project in the proposal is the extension of Bay Area
Rapid Transit, or BART, to San Jose. Davis' plan would lend seed
money to the $4 billion project. BART currently serves San
Francisco and the eastern San Francisco Bay.

<HEADLINE> Train Saw Bus Before Tenn. Crash  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA K. BROWN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- Two crew members on a freight train
say they watched in helpless horror as a school bus sped toward a
crossing in the seconds before it was struck by the train's
locomotive, investigators said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The accident Tuesday morning just north of the Georgia state
line killed three children. Five others including the bus driver
were injured, and two children remained in critical condition
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer and conductor on the CSX train said they watched
helplessly as the bus sped toward the railroad crossing, said Ken
Suydam, investigator in charge for the National Transportation
Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both saw the bus approaching at a rapid rate of speed and
expressed concern to each other as to whether the bus would stop,''
he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   However, investigators do not yet know how fast the bus was
traveling or if driver Rhonda Cloer tried to stop, Suydam said. The
manufacturer examined the bus' anti-lock braking system and
reported it was working properly, Suydam said.
</P>
<P>
   Cloer, released from a hospital Wednesday, still refuses to be
interviewed by authorities, Suydam said. Her 5-year-old daughter
was on the bus and was one of the two children in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The train was traveling about 50 mph and first blew its whistle
about 1,000 feet from the crossing and again continuously at 620
feet away, said NTSB investigator David Rayburn. The emergency
brake was applied at 160 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   The impact ripped the body of the bus from its chassis and
dragged it 100 yards. Three children and the driver were ejected,
and four other children remained inside the bus.
</P>
<P>
   School buses are required by law to stop between 15 and 50 feet
from railroad crossings.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have studied a videotape from a camera mounted
inside the bus and have talked to a child who was wearing a lapbelt
and was the least injured. According to the recording, several
people were talking in the bus and the radio was playing, Suydam
said, but he would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities won't decide whether to file charges until they
finish the investigation, which could take two more weeks, said
Highway Patrol Lt. Mike Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer and conductor voluntarily submitted to toxicology
tests and have been cooperating with authorities, Suydam said.
Results are pending.

<HEADLINE> NY Police Kill 2 Gang Members  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two undercover narcotics officers fatally shot
two reputed gang members after they robbed the policemen by
brandishing fake handguns, authorities said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings come with tensions in the city still high after
the fatal March 16 shooting of an unarmed black man. Police were
quick to defend the officers in this incident, which occurred
during a Friday night drug operation in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The dead suspects, 19-year-old Tysheen Bourne and 17-year-old
Andre Long, both pointed realistic-looking fake weapons at the two
officers before any shots were fired, police Assistant Chief Joseph
Esposito told a news conference at Police Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, who were killed in a barrage of 18 shots, were
affiliated with the Bloods street gang and had previous arrests
records, Esposito said.
</P>
<P>
   Three suspects remained at large.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were part of Operation Condor, a controversial
anti-drug initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover police, although not part of that operation, were
involved in the fatal shooting of Patrick Dorismond on March 16.
The unarmed Dorismond was shot during a scuffle with an officer
looking to buy marijuana, setting off angry protests.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was the fourth unarmed black man shot by police in the
last 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's shooting began when police arrested three marijuana
dealers. The two officers, whose names were not released, were
standing on the street afterward when the five men approached them.
</P>
<P>
   They snatched a gold necklace and a bracelet from one officer,
and a cell phone and wallet from the other, Esposito said. When
they demanded that the first officer also surrender his wallet, he
was able to pull his gun and defend himself, Esposito said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These five individuals were out to rob someone,'' Esposito
said. ''They had the misfortune of picking out two of our
undercovers.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Janitors May Soon Strike  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Thousands of janitors in Los Angeles could
vote to exchange buckets and brooms for union banners this week,
and union officials say expiring contracts in other cities mean a
work stoppage could expand.
</P>
<P>
   The contract for the 8,500 janitors who empty trash and clean
toilets at commercial properties in downtown, Century City and
elsewhere in Los Angeles County expired Friday night. Officials
from both sides say they are so far apart further negotiations
would be pointless.
</P>
<P>
   A strike vote planned for Monday will be followed by all-night
picketing, marches and chants, and civil disobedience, the union
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything we can think of we're going to throw at them,''
said Mike Garcia, president of the Service Employees International
Union, Local 1877.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts covering some 100,000 janitors nationwide will expire
in coming months. Those contracts cover union-cleaned buildings in
New York, Chicago, Silicon Valley, Philadelphia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a nationwide movement of the poorest and most
exploited workers,'' said Stephen Lerner, the union's building
services director. ''We see this as a time when janitors are going
to stand up around the country and say, 'This incredible economic
prosperity is not trickling down.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with 18 cleaning contractors broke down when union
leaders asked for $1 an hour raises for the next three years -- the
average hourly wage is now $6.90. Contractors offered a one-year
wage freeze for a majority of janitors followed by 40-cent-per-hour
increases over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Davis, the bargaining coordinator for the contractors, said
Saturday they initially offered a five-year wage freeze and made
significant concessions from there. The union, he said, was not
similarly flexible.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, they just haven't engaged in fair bargaining,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the contractors have hired temporary workers and
taken other measures to ensure most office buildings will see
virtually no change to their janitorial services.
</P>
<P>
   Service Employees International, which claims 70 to 80 percent
membership in many major cities, said janitors have yet to share in
America's economic boom and many still live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The union says it must strategize nationally because building
managers and contractors are increasingly national firms. Union
locals nationwide have collaborated to plan events, including a
protest April 12 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're doing is we're organizing ourselves to mirror how
they're organized,'' Lerner said. ''The people who oppose us are
incredibly wealthy and powerful. But what we have is janitors who
have a thirst for justice.''

   ''If he is sent back to Cuba he will have no future,'' said
German Miret, a Miami businessman and member of the group. ''He
will become a son of the revolution. He will no longer be a son of
his father.''
</P>
<P>
   The few hours of quiet outside the boy's Miami relatives' house
Saturday morning while Elian played with a pet rabbit didn't last.
By afternoon, about 100 Cuban-Americans protesting the Immigration
and Naturalization Service order to return the boy to his father in
Cuba were gathering again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will stay here in case immigration comes to take him away,''
said Sacha Sanchez, who blasted a scratchy recording of the Cuban
national anthem over a bullhorn between lengthy speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers fighting over the little boy's future spent the day
preparing to take up the battle once again.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has threatened to revoke the boy's residency status, but
twice last week pushed back a deadline for the relatives to agree,
now set for 9 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Miami-based anti-Castro group Democracy
Movement said it is poised to react if the government attempts to
take Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have called for people to get ready in the event Elian is
deported,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez. He warned that the group could
quickly mobilize a massive civil disobedience campaign that would
slow commerce at Miami's port, airport and highways.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not willing to harm anyone, but we are willing to die
to defend the Constitutional rights of Elian Gonzalez,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who favors returning Elian to his family, spoke to
students at the University of Virginia Law School on Saturday and
reiterated her position that the boy's father should have the right
to speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, Vice President Al Gore broke with the Clinton
administration and called for keeping the boy in America.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the Senate campaign trail Saturday in New York,
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton came out against the call for
Congressional action to make Elian a U.S. resident.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary Clinton knows that we must take politics out of this
decision,'' said campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson. ''Elian's
future should be determined as quickly as possible through the
appropriate, ongoing legal process.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has requested a visa to
come to the United States. He wants custody of the boy while the
Miami relatives appeal a federal court ruling that backs an
Immigration and Naturalization Service decision to return Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives say Elian's father can visit his son at
their home, but they are unwilling to hand the boy over.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, has refused to sign
a promise to INS officials that he will surrender Elian if he and
his family lose their court battle.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Saturday, Lazaro Gonzalez said the boy's father
should come to Miami and interact with Elian in a family setting
under circumstances that are best for the child.
</P>
<P>
   ''We appeal to Juan Miguel to come to our home with his wife and
son and sit with us around the family table,'' the statement said.
''We want no government officials, no lawyers and no press, only
family.
</P>
<P>
   The family also presented copies of a telephone bill showing a
four-minute collect call made to the Miami relatives on Nov. 22 and
a Cuban telephone directory, with a listing for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez's father as the source of the call.
</P>
<P>
   The records were offered as proof of the Miami family's claims
that Elian's grandfather, who is Lazaro Gonzalez's brother, called
in advance to inform them that Elian and his mother would be
arriving in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found on an innertube off Florida's coast Thanksgiving
Day. His mother and 10 others died after their boat sank two days
earlier during an attempt to reach the United States.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Urge Panel To Boost Exports  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES HANNAH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST CHESTER, Ohio (AP) -- Farmers urged a congressional
committee Saturday to boost exports to counter low market prices
for corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't stand these low commodity prices much longer,'' said
farmer Wayne Kilpatrick of Frazeysburg. ''There's just way too much
production out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilpatrick was among nearly 20 farmers from Ohio, Indiana and
Kentucky who testified at hearing before the House Agriculture
Committee. Rep. Charles Stenholm, a committee member and Texas
Democrat, said farmers and rural America aren't sharing the
economic good times.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question we're looking to answer is, 'Why?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer Thomas Spellmire of Lebanon told the panel that farmers
would get more money for their crops if the government did more to
help them export the commodities, such as develop a permanent trade
agreement with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the lack of a trading agreement with China is no excuse
for the lack of an aggressive export program,'' he said. ''There
are plenty of other countries we could be exporting to.''
</P>
<P>
   Spellmire suggested the government turn over its
export-enhancement program to the private sector. The hearing, one
of 10 scheduled around the country, was held to gather suggestions
from farmers on how to improve the nation's farm policy.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers also voiced concern about the rising cost of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to really put a hurt on the farmers for the
spring planting season,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested the government increase funding to develop
alternate sources of fuel such as ethanol and soy diesel.

Protesters Oppose Returning Elian

   MIAMI, Fla. (AP) -- About 100 Cuban-Americans protesting the Immigration and
Naturalization Service order to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez boy to his
father in Cuba gathered outside the boy's Miami relatives' home today. A
nonprofit group called the Cuban Information Committee ran a full-page ad in The
Miami Herald touting reasons why Elian should stay in America. The leader of the
Miami-based anti-Castro group Democracy Movement said it is poised to react if
the government attempts to take Elian. The INS has threatened to revoke the

for his own race through his ties to the political far right. So far, Giuliani
has raised about $19 million for his Senate campaign, the first lady $12

   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- Two crew members on a freight train say they
watched in helpless horror as a school bus sped toward a crossing in the seconds
before it was struck by the train's locomotive, investigators said today. The
accident Tuesday morning just north of the Georgia state line killed three
children. Five others including the bus driver were injured, and two children
remained in critical condition Saturday. The train was traveling about 50 mph
and first blew its whistle about 1,000 feet from the crossing and again
continuously at 620 feet away, said NTSB investigator David Rayburn. The

   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- Longtime opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade was sworn in
as president of Senegal on Saturday, ending the 40-year rule of one party here.
About 80,000 people filled the national stadium in the capital, Dakar. They
cheered wildly and chanted ''sopi'' -- ''change'' in the Wolof language. The
election was a rare peaceful and democratic power transfer on a continent
plagued by election fraud, coups and civil wars. Former President Abdou Diouf,
who came to power in 1981, did not wait for the official results before
conceding defeat to his rival in a runoff ballot last month.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton at odds with Al Gore  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton on Saturday opposed
Congressional action to make Elian Gonzalez a resident of this
country, putting her at odds with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary Clinton knows that we must take politics out of this
decision,'' said Clinton Senate campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson.
''Elian's future should be determined as quickly as possible
through the appropriate, ongoing legal process.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was upstate Saturday to pick up the endorsements of two
politically powerful labor unions -- the Civil Service Employees
Association and the National Education Association of New York -- in
her Senate race against Republican New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, urged
Congress last week to pass a law that would grant permanent
resident status to 6-year-old Elian, his father, stepmother, half
brother, grandmothers and grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton remains opposed to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   At an appearance in Syracuse, the first lady dodged questions
about her position and whether she felt Gore, as well as Giuliani,
was politicizing the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I put out a statement on that ... That's all I'm going to say
about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, will come to the United
States as soon as he is assured that he will be given custody of
his son, said his lawyer, Gregory Craig. The lawyer said he also
will seek permission for the boy's classmates, teacher and doctors
to travel to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's position on Elian also put her at odds with Giuliani,
who maintains that the boy should be granted U.S. citizenship and
that any custody issues should be handled in family court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton is ducking this issue,'' said Giuliani spokesman
Bruce Teitlebaum.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Warns Israel on Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- In an apparent attempt to rattle Israeli
leaders, Lebanon's defense minister said a unilateral withdrawal
from southern Lebanon could put Syrian troops on Israel's northern
border and bring Tel Aviv within Syrian rocket range.
</P>
<P>
   Deploying Syrian troops into southern Lebanon is considered
highly unlikely, but Defense Minister Ghazi Zueiter's comments late
Friday appeared aimed at fueling fears that Israeli leaders already
have about a withdrawal without a prior agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel wants Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, to rein in
guerrillas in southern Lebanon, but has said it will withdraw by
July even without a deal. Beirut and Damascus oppose a unilateral
withdrawal and want it to take place within the context of an
overall peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   At a symposium in southern Lebanon, Zueiter raised the scenario
of Syrian troops moving into fill the void left by Israeli troops.
Some excerpts of the speech were broadcast on television Saturday,
and all were in his prepared text from which he did not diverge in
these areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Asking Syrian forces, which are legally stationed here, to
accompany the Lebanese army to the vacated areas would be one of
the important possibilities in case of such an Israeli (troop)
redeployment,'' Zueiter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And it would not be difficult for any normal person to
understand that this would bring Tel Aviv within the range of
Syrian missiles,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   An official statement from Zueiter late Saturday night said his
words about Syrian deployment toward the international border with
Israel were taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   The prepared text indicated Zueiter was analyzing Israeli
leaders' concerns about the possibility that with a unilateral
withdrawal Lebanon could ask Syria for help.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has had 30,000 troops in much of Lebanon since 1976. Some
are deployed in Sidon, on the coast 37 miles north of the border,
and the southern Bekaa Valley, 18 miles north of the border. Syria
has not tried to move further south.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government hasn't said what it will do if Israel
pulls out of the border zone it has occupied since 1985
unilaterally -- even whether it will send the Lebanese army to fill
the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Trade and Industry Minister Ran Cohen described
Zueiter's comments as a Lebanese-Syrian attempt to keep the border
tense while avoiding peace talks. ''This is a trick and an evasion
of responsibility by the Lebanese government in connivance with the
Syrian government,'' he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If Israel pulls out of southern Lebanon, Syria would be deprived
of a card in its on-and-off negotiations with the Jewish state for
the return of the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967
Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has warned that attacks on it territory after a
withdrawal would be met with harsh retaliation. Israel established
the zone to prevent cross-border attacks into north Israel.

<HEADLINE> European, African Leaders Bicker  </HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- European and African nations bickered
Saturday during preparations for a landmark summit, indicating that
old hurts and divisions may overcome hoped-for goodwill at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural Africa-European Union summit, which will be on
Monday and Tuesday, is meant to raise international awareness of
Africa's potential and plight, promote its integration into the
global economy and develop peace and democracy in the region. The
event is being viewed by some as a largely symbolic show of unity
following a century of colonialism and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   However, some African nations warned Saturday that they would
not accept any domineering tone when Europeans raise human rights
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We as Arabs, Muslims and Africans care more than others about
human rights because man is sacred for us and we are not waiting
for others to lecture us on fields of human rights and democracy,''
said Ali al-Treiki, Libya's minister of African affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Britain however, said it planned to do just that by raising
Zimbabwe's treatment of white protesters opposed to President
Robert Mugabe, which British foreign office minister Peter Hain has
denounced as ''thuggery orchestrated from on high.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is clear evidence of racist, anti-white attacks, which
is especially disturbing coming from a party which came to power 20
years ago on a tide of anti-racist sentiment,'' said Peter Hain,
the British Foreign Office minister of state.
</P>
<P>
   EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten said the summit
should keep no issues under the carpet. ''I hope the summit will
promote realistic, frank and high-level dialogue,'' Patten said.
</P>
<P>
   The Africans want the summit to focus on debt relief, increasing
foreign investment and better trade terms. Besides human rights,
the European Union wants to talk about democracy, rule of law and
clean government as conditions for cooperation with Africa.
Priorities include such conversation topics as arms and drug
trafficking, refugees and illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Another cloud over the meeting was a report in Germany that a
terrorism suspect planned to name Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi as
having ordered a 1975 attack on an OPEC oil ministers' conference
in Vienna. Three people were killed in that attack.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the German newspaper report, al-Treiki refused
to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi, who is already in Egypt, is expected to try to improve
ties with EU nations. He plans to meet with ''some European
leaders,'' al-Treiki said, cited by Egypt's Middle East News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen EU heads of state and at least 20 leaders of Africa's 53
countries are expected to attend. Somalia was not invited because
it does not have a recognized government and the remaining
countries will send other top leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Non-governmental organizations said a parallel meeting on Sunday
to highlight corruption and human rights abuses in Africa had been
banned by Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   A network of European and African human rights groups plan to
issue a written plea to summit participants Tuesday demanding
increased European aid to Africa as a ''symbolic compensation for
the injustices of colonization,'' the Cairo Institute for Human
Rights Studies, a local think tank, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It said the groups will also ask Europe to publicly apologize to
the African people for the colonization.
</P>
<P>
   French president Jacques Chirac is expected to raise the issue
of the debt burden in Africa, where some nations spend more on debt
payments than on education and health combined. That issue will be
under discussion Sunday when foreign ministers meet to iron out the
final differences ahead of the summit.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Rally for Elian in Cuba  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Tens of thousands of people paid tribute to the
men who launched the Cuban Revolution more than four decades ago in
a rally Saturday demanding the return of Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   With the historic yacht Granma towering behind him, Raul Castro,
younger brother of President Fidel Castro and head of Cuba's
Revolutionary Armed Forces, likened the revolutionary battle to the
fight for Elian, the 6-year-old boy at the center of an
international custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here, no one gives up!'' Castro declared.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, wearing T-shirts with Elian's portrait, waved
red, white and blue Cuban flags on the shore of the community of
Niquero, where the Granma landed on Dec. 2, 1956, with 82 armed men
led by Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, the guerrilla fighters waged war on
the troops of dictator Fulgencio Batista, declaring victory on Jan.
1, 1959 when Batista fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   Castro noted the importance that Cuba's younger generations have
played in the communist government's battle to secure Elian's
return from the United States, where the boy's Miami relatives are
fighting for permanent custody.
</P>
<P>
   As a father and the grandfather of eight children -- including a
boy who just turned 6, the same age as Elian -- Castro said he
sympathized with the little boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has cited his rights as the child's sole surviving
parent in his calls for his boy to be returned to him in communist
Cuba. Elian's mother and 10 others perished when their boat sank
off the coast of Florida in late November during a crossing from
Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian today is the symbol of our unity,'' Castro said to
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ''And our struggle will not end with the return of Elian,''
added Castro. He said the Cuban people would continue to protest
American laws and policies aimed at Cuba, including a four-decade
economic embargo and continued U.S. military presence at the
Guantanamo Naval Station on the easternmost end of the island.

<HEADLINE> Japan Wants Ties With North Korea  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A narrow sea separates two nations that could
scarcely be more different.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, Japan, the world's second-richest country and an
engine of global capitalism. On the other, North Korea, whose
bombastic Stalinist rhetoric ill conceals a feeble economy and
near-complete isolation from the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   In talks beginning Tuesday, officials hope to narrow that gap.
How close they come could affect security throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the two neighbors are scheduled to hold
five days of talks in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, for talks
to establish diplomatic ties. Similar negotiations broke off eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles are formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo is still angry about Pyongyang's launch of a ballistic
missile that flew over Japan in 1998 and is demanding answers about
the alleged abduction of its citizens by North Korean agents.
</P>
<P>
   The North, whose penchant for brinksmanship has always made it a
difficult negotiating partner, wants compensation for its suffering
under Japan's brutal colonial rule, from 1910 to 1945 -- a demand
Tokyo already says it will refuse.
</P>
<P>
   But while few breakthroughs are expected during the first round
of talks, there are signs that the North's desperate economic
situation might lead it to concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The North is in a weak position,'' said Toshio Miyashita, a
North Korea expert at Yamanashi Gakuin University, noting that
North Korea has been sending out diplomatic feelers to former Cold
War enemies as it seeks aid to cover drastic food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo sees engagement with North Korea as one way to help ensure
peace in Asia. North Korea is widely seen as a sponsor of
terrorism. Its aggressive missile program and enigmatic
totalitarian regime make many consider it the biggest threat to
security in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has for years maintained a hard-line stance in dealing
with Pyongyang. In particular, Tokyo has demanded information on
citizens it accuses the North of kidnapping as a condition for
warmer ties. The abductees were allegedly taken in the 1970s and
1980s to train as North Korean spies.
</P>
<P>
   But Tokyo's stance has also softened recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''Japan feels that in order to bring about change in the North
Korean regime, it must follow a policy of engagement,'' said Masao
Okonogi, a professor of international relations at Keio University.
''The real issue for Japan is peace and stability on the Korean
Peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary meetings in Beijing last year, Japan promised to
resume food aid cut off after the missile launch.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say the time may be right to lure Pyongyang out of
its ideological shell.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea recently embarked on its biggest diplomatic push in
years, establishing diplomatic ties with Italy, sending envoys to
Australia and stepping up meetings with U.S. representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Okonogi said North Korean leaders seem eager to create a secure
framework for closer relations with major industrial countries in
case of a Republican victory in the U.S. presidential election.
Conservatives have stepped up criticism of what they view as the
Clinton administration's policy of appeasement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The North is really on an overall diplomatic maneuver to
prepare for a change of administration in the United States,''
Okonogi said. ''They want guarantees in case of a Republican
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are promising signs, negotiations will be
complicated by the fact that neither North Korea nor Japan can
afford to appear to be making concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang relies on strident state-run media dispatches
attacking Japan, South Korea and the United States to reinforce
suspicion of the outside world among its people.
</P>
<P>
   After the ballistic missile test, Japanese public opinion swung
markedly against building warmer ties. And politicians have been
visiting the families of missing Japanese to assure them the
government will continue to push for their return.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Japanese government feels it has to take into
consideration public opinion,'' Miyashita said.

<HEADLINE> FAA Orders Inspections of Boeings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration ordered
immediate inspections Saturday of 14 Boeing 717-200 airliners to
check for potential electrical problems in altitude indicators and
make necessary modifications.
</P>
<P>
   The order follows reports of two instances of intermittent loss
of information on the captain and first officer's primary flight
display and integrated standby instrument system display, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, airspeed and altitude indicators remained
operational and the flights were completed without incident, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   The planes affected by the order are operated by Trans World
Airlines and Air Tran. Olympia Airlines, a Greek carrier, also
operates two 717-200s, which first entered service last year.
</P>
<P>
   Before the affected planes can fly again, the FAA said,
electrical cables must be coiled and stowed between the glareshield
and the standby display to further isolate the display from other
instruments and revise operational procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The agency estimated the work would take two hours to complete
at a cost of $120 per plane.

<HEADLINE> Two reputed gang members killed after police robbery  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two undercover narcotics officers, seconds after
they were robbed by five gang members brandishing fake handguns,
killed two of the suspects in a spray of 18 bullets on a Brooklyn
street, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With tensions in the city still high after the fatal March 16
shooting of an unarmed black man, police were quick to defend the
officers in this incident that occurred during a Friday night drug
operation in the Bushwick section.
</P>
<P>
   The dead suspects were identified as 19-year-old Tysheen Bourne
and 17-year-old Andre Fields, and were both black. Both pointed
realistic-looking fake weapons at the two officers before any shots
were fired, police Assistant Chief Joseph Esposito told a news
conference at Police Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were affiliated with the Bloods street gang and had
previous arrest records, Esposito said. Bourne was out on parole
since September 1999 on a robbery charge, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Three suspects remained at large. The weapons used in the
robbery were actually simulated guns wrapped in black tape to make
them appear more genuine, Esposito said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were part of Operation Condor, a controversial
anti-drug initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover cops, although not part of that operation, were
involved in the fatal shooting of Patrick Dorismond on March 16.
The unarmed Dorismond was shot during a scuffle with an officer
looking to buy marijuana, setting off angry protests.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dorismond was the fourth unarmed black man shot by
police in the last 13 months, statistics show that police shootings
are actually down in New York. In 1991, there were 41 shootings; in
1999, there were 11.
</P>
<P>
   According to Esposito, the most recent incident began Friday
night when police arrested three marijuana dealers near Cooper
Street. The two officers, whose names were not released, were
standing on the street afterward when the five men approached them.
</P>
<P>
   ''These five individuals were out to rob someone,'' Esposito
said. ''They had the misfortune of picking out two of our
undercovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the assailants produced weapons, with one putting his
gun to an officer's head and the two others pointing their guns at
the second officer's back and chest.
</P>
<P>
   They snatched a gold necklace and a bracelet from one officer,
and a cell phone and a wallet from the other, Esposito said. When
they demanded that the first officer also surrender his wallet, he
was able to pull his gun and defend himself, Esposito said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen shots were fired, with Bourne and Fields fatally
wounded. The three other suspects escaped, eluding a Friday night
manhunt that included a helicopter and a bloodhound.
</P>
<P>
   Two taped-wrapped fake guns were found on the street, along with
a broken gold chain and the officer's wallet. The cell phone was
recovered on the body of one of the dead men, Esposito said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the officers was a nine-year veteran, while the other had
been on the force for six years. Both had about two years'
experience in undercover work.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, the undercover operation was prompted by
calls from neighborhood residents complaining about the drug trade.
Since Jan. 1, more than 40 drug arrests have been made in the area,
police said.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Bids $10.5B for French Bank  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The British banking group HSBC Holdings PLC
announced Saturday that it has made a $10.5 billion bid for Credit
Commercial de France and that the board of the French bank had
unanimously recommended the offer to its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The offer is for the purchase of all outstanding shares of the
French bank at a price of $144 per share in cash or, as an
alternative, 13 shares of HSBC for each Credit Commercial share,
valued at approximately $154 each.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC said the acquisition would give it a ''significant base for
operation in the Euro-zone,'' and bring relationships with most
major French companies.
</P>
<P>
   ING Groep of Amsterdam, with 19.05 percent of Credit
Commercial's shares, announced its support for the bid and said the
sale of its shares would produce a profit of approximately $864
million before tax.
</P>
<P>
   In December, ING, the Netherlands' largest financial services
company, offered $10.1 billion for Credit Commercial de France but
withdrew the bid after the French bank failed to embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC said the other major shareholder, Swiss Life with 15
percent of shares, has committed to accept its offer in exchange
for shares of HSBC.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC said that the aggregate value of its cash offer is
approximately $10.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Commercial's headquarters will remain in Paris ''and its
board and management will continue to direct its affairs,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Commercial has 650 branches in France, HSBC said. It is a
leading foreign bank in Brazil and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   For HSBC, the acquisition ''represents a unique opportunity to
build a platform in the Euro-zone, where we have been
underrepresented,'' said HSBC Group chairman Sir John Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Charles de Croisset, chairman of Credit Commercial, said the
transaction was ''the result of extensive and friendly discussions,
which have allowed us to reach agreement on a clear and concerted
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   HSBC expected the acquisition to be completed during the second
half of 2000, subject to necessary regulatory approvals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a $9.8 billion merger, HSBC purchased Republic New
York Corp., parent of Republic National Bank of New York.

<HEADLINE> Report Outrages Aboriginal Groups  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Aboriginal groups are threatening to
disrupt the Olympic games over a report that the Australian
government is playing down the number of Aboriginal children
forcibly placed with white families -- the so-called ''stolen
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   New South Wales' 118 Aboriginal land councils voted to march in
protest on Sept. 16, the first full day of competition in the games
in Sydney, The Sun-Herald newpaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly the Olympic Games will now be in jeopardy,'' Charles
Perkins, director of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Commission (ATSIC) director.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not want to target the Games, but we have nothing to
lose now. We have racism at the highest level of government now,
destroying the relationship between the whites and the blacks,''
said Perkins, himself a ''stolen generation'' child.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that Aborigines were doomed and that absorbing the
children was the only alternative, the Australian government took
an estimated 100,000 Aboriginal children from their parents between
1910 and the 1970s. Light-skinned Aboriginal children were given to
white families for adoption. Dark-skinned children were put in
orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginal groups have long demanded an apology for the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph in Sydney reported Saturday that it had
obtained a high-level government document saying the widely
accepted numbers had been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was never a generation of stolen children,'' it quoted
the document as stating.
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron confirmed that the
report was the work of his office and would become the federal
government's submission to an independent inquiry into the issue.
But he said it just summed up the government's existing policies.

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Talks between the federal government and Microsoft broke down
today and the judge trying to mediate a settlement in the antitrust lawsuit said
he was ending his effort. Federal appeals court Judge Richard Posner said that
he had tried to find a common ground that might enable the two sides to settle
their differences. Posner said in a statement that the disagreements are too
deep-seated to be bridged. At issue is a lawsuit filed by the federal government
and 19 states alleging that Microsoft repeatedly engaged in illegal
anticompetitive behavior by using monopoly power. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates

emergency stockpile and pass a range of energy measures vital to maintaining a

children. Five others including the bus driver were injured, and two children
remained in critical condition Saturday. The train was traveling about 50 mph
and first blew its whistle about 1,000 feet from the crossing and again
continuously at 620 feet away, said NTSB investigator David Rayburn. The

<HEADLINE> Three N.H. Justices May Be Removed  </HEADLINE>
By KATHARINE WEBSTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A day after one state Supreme Court justice
was forced to resign, a state lawmaker said Saturday three of the
remaining four justices could face removal by the Legislature for
ethics violations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the state's judiciary has just had a tremendous train
wreck, and it's going to take us a long time to dig all the bodies
out of the wreckage,'' said Republican Rep. Paul Mirski.
</P>
<P>
   Mirski said he planned to file a bill Monday to impeach or
otherwise remove Chief Justice David Brock. Impeachable offenses
include ''bribery, corruption, malpractice or maladministration in
office.'' Judges can be removed for other offenses through a ''bill
of address.''
</P>
<P>
   Accused of criminal ethics violations, Justice Stephen Thayer
resigned Friday. In return, state Attorney General Philip
McLaughlin promised not to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   But McLaughlin issued a 25-page report that not only detailed
Thayer's transgressions but also accused the entire court of ethics
violations. He said it was an ''institutional practice'' for judges
who had excused themselves from cases to review and discuss draft
decisions in those cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''To disqualify means that a judge has no more authority (in a
case) than any other citizen,'' McLaughlin wrote in a cover letter.
''Practices to the contrary are unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Pierce Law Center professor Richard Hesse said the
revelation was extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the extent it's a general practice and none of the judges
saw fit to blow the whistle on it, the whole court is tainted,''
Hesse said.
</P>
<P>
   The court's other members are Joseph Nadeau, who is too new to
have been involved; Sherman Horton; and John Broderick. Both Horton
and Broderick commented on a draft opinion in one case from which
they had disqualified themselves, McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Horton, in a telephone interview Saturday, said he could not
think of a single case that would have to be overturned. He also
said recused justices usually played only a minimal role, such as
commenting on grammar.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, justices who excused themselves because of poor
health might comment on the merits of a ruling, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of us were lazy and wouldn't read them. I was one of the
lazy ones,'' Horton said. ''Others were interested in what was
going on in the court and would read them and comment, but nothing
that would violate the purpose or principle of recusal.''

<HEADLINE> 700 Indians Return to Chiapas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- About 700 Indians have
returned to homes in the southern state of Chiapas that they fled
following a December 1997 massacre of 45 civilians by
pro-government paramilitaries in the village of Acteal.
</P>
<P>
   The residents -- the largest group to return since the massacre --
came home to the town of Chimix on Friday. They were persuaded to
return by government safety assurances and promises of social
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Chimix residents allied with anti-government Zapatista rebels
have not yet returned.

<HEADLINE> Arrests reported as World Bank/IMF protest ends  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) -- Hoisting signs reading ''More World,
Less Bank,'' about 200 people protested Saturday as officials of
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank concluded a
three-day conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The mostly peaceful rally was marred by the arrests of several
protesters taken into custody late in the afternoon, near the close
of meetings sponsored by the two organizations and the Brookings
Institute. The rally was held in a barricaded parking lot next to
the Hamilton Park Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
   Police turned out in force to ensure organizers kept their
pledge that there would be no violence or vandalism at the rally,
organized by a coalition of grassroots groups called the New
Jersey/New York Mobilization for Global Justice. Coalition members
believe the World Bank and the IMF, charged with improving life in
developing countries, instead throw the countries into debt while
enriching corporations and degrading the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested were Nicole Anna Roskos, 27, of Madison; Jonathan
Crowell, 25, of Wayne; Samantha Gayathrilyer, 18, of Olney, Md.;
Dennis Griggs, 53, of New York; Hannah Tidman, 19, of North Canton,
Ohio; Brett Levin, 25, of Staten Island, N.Y.; and a 16-year-old
girl whose name was not released.
</P>
<P>
   All were charged with failing to disperse upon official orders,
except Levin, who was charged with trespassing on private property.
</P>
<P>
   On of the rally's organizers, Jeff Burchell of Madison,
criticized those who were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought we had an agreement that the rally would be here,
and some people thought that wasn't cool enough, so they wanted to
spark a confrontation with police,'' he told the Daily Record of
Parsippany for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Orange resident Miriam Axel-Lute, a member of the group New York
Direct Action Network, said the arrests began about 4:30 p.m. when
some protesters left the parking lot area and tried to stand along
a driveway departing conference delegates were expected to use.
Axel-Lute said police told demonstrators to clear the driveway, and
they began doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently, the police believed they were doing so too
slowly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the coalition's promise of a peaceful protest, the rally
had been billed in advance as ''picking up where Seattle left
off,'' a reference to destructive demonstrations at the World Trade
Organization meeting there in November. It also was to be a prelude
to a projected demonstration of thousands at a World Bank/IMF
meeting April 16 and 17 in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people attending this weekend's conference are meeting
to discuss the collapse of economies in Asia and its effect on
developing countries. Bank spokesman Andrew Kircher said the bank
has noticed a rising level of awareness of the meetings in the
United States, especially since the Seattle protests.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Saturday's five-hour rally, protesters barely
outnumbered the police -- about 100 officers, including mounted
police and a SWAT team.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters included members of environmental, labor, student and
human rights groups. Dozens of activists and musicians addressed or
performed for the crowd of mostly college-aged people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The system stinks,'' the Rev. Jack Martin of Sacred Heart
Roman Catholic Church in Newark, told the crowd as he held a
handkerchief over his face. ''They say a rising tide lifts all
boats. It's been my experience it lifts all yachts.''
</P>
<P>
   Newark resident Rosanne Mazza, who said she attended the event
to support organized labor, shook her maracas vigorously as Bill
Kane, president of the New Jersey Industrial Union Council,
complained about corporate downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   The council's ''Solidarity Singers,'' performing to the tune of
''It's a Small World After All,'' sang lyrics including,
''Exploitation After All'' and ''For a Small Wage After All.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of protesters in the crowd waved signs with slogans such
as ''IMF/World Bank, Corporate Colonialism,'' ''Why Are Starving
People Selling Food?'' and ''World Bank, Criminal Loan Sharks.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the afternoon, the rally seemed more like a music
festival, with one folk singer hawking her CD to the crowd after
performing and some attendees sunbathing. Others had their own
agendas, promoting political causes from expanding legalized
gambling to freeing Mumia Abu Jamal, a former journalist on
Pennsylvania's death row for the killing of a Philadelphia police
officer.

Mediator in Microsoft Case Gives Up
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Richard Posner, the federal appeals court judge trying to
mediate a settlement between the federal government and Microsoft, said today he
was ending his effort to get the two sides to settle their differences. Posner
said in a statement that the disagreements are too deep-seated to be bridged. At
issue is a lawsuit filed by the federal government and 19 states alleging that
Microsoft repeatedly engaged in illegal anticompetitive behavior by using
monopoly power. ''It's unfortunate that a settlement wasn't possible,''
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said in a conference call.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged Americans today to make their

Clinton said in his weekly radio address. ''An inaccurate census distorts our
understanding of a community's needs.'' Today is Census Day, April 1, the

Report Outrages Aboriginal Groups

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Aboriginal groups are threatening to disrupt the

number of Aboriginal children forcibly placed with white families -- the
so-called ''stolen generation.'' New South Wales' 118 Aboriginal land councils
voted to march in protest on Sept. 16, the first full day of competition in the
games in Sydney, The Sun-Herald newspaper reported Sunday. Believing that
Aborigines were doomed and that absorbing the children was the only alternative,
the Australian government took an estimated 100,000 Aboriginal children from
their parents between 1910 and the 1970s.

   FORK UNION, Va. (AP) -- The crisp uniforms and strict discipline of military

military schools are in the works, existing institutions report rising piles of
applications and even the liberal mayor of Oakland, Calif., Jerry Brown, is
supporting military-style education as a remedy for troubled schools in his
city. ''The discipline issue, the organizational skills that we teach, the core
values of spirituality, honesty and integrity. ... Parents are not finding those
kind of things in public schools,'' said John Jackson, who serves as president
of Fork Union Military Academy in central Virginia. Applications there are up 15

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Marks Capture of Nha Trang  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD VOGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NHA TRANG, Vietnam (AP) -- A beachside parade Sunday commemorated
the 25th anniversary of the communist capture of Nha Trang, the
last major domino to fall before victory in Saigon a month later
ended the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ''The price for this glorious victory was enormous; nothing can
compare,'' Nguyen Thi Hong Van, chief of the Khanh Hoa provincial
Communist Party organization, said in a speech kicking off the
nationally televised dawn celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thousands of our people fell for the liberation of the
province and the country. Many of their remains have not been
recovered. We forever remember the sacrifices of the martyrs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of red balloons then were released into the air, sailing
out over the surf of Vietnam's best-developed beach resort as the
sun broke through the clouds that had poured rain on the area an
hour earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth major commemoration in a month of the
former-North Vietnam's lightning-quick capture of U.S.-backed South
Vietnam in spring 1975, culminating in the fall of Saigon on April
30. That ended a war that killed 58,000 Americans and an estimated
3 million Vietnamese, while leaving 300,000 listed as missing in
action.
</P>
<P>
   The country was reunified under the communist banner. The
government, plagued recently by corruption and seeking to bolster
its image, has been staging major events to mark the victory and
rekindle waning national patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Hue and Danang in late March 1975 and the defeat of
the Saigon army at Phoenix Pass on the highway between Buon Ma
Thuot and Nha Trang on April 1 applied direct pressure at Nha
Trang's doorstep. The town fell on the afternoon of April 2,
followed by nearby Cam Ranh military base the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The image of communist revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh was
everywhere Sunday, looming over the viewing stands for VIPs and
smiling from portraits carried by children and aging soldiers whose
uniforms dripped medals.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of white-gloved soldiers goose-stepped down the road that
runs between the white sand and the tourist hotels, followed by
groups of women in flowing white traditional ao dai dresses.
Colorful papier-mache dragons and lions snaked along as brightly
dressed youths beat drums.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actress Halle Berry, charged with leaving the
scene of an accident that injured another driver, surrendered
Saturday to sheriff's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Berry went to the Lennox station of the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department, where she was booked on a misdemeanor warrant
and released, Sgt. Ronald Fernstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   The charge, filed Friday by the district attorney's office, is
the result of a Feb. 23 crash at a Sunset Strip intersection in
West Hollywood. If convicted, the 31-year-old star of the cable TV
movie ''Introducing Dorothy Dandridge'' could face up to one year
in county jail and a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities contend that Berry's rented Chevrolet Blazer ran a
red light, struck another car and then left the scene. The actress
suffered a gash in her forehead that took 22 stitches to close.
</P>
<P>
   The other driver, Hatal Raythatha, has sued Berry for
negligence. She suffered a broken wrist and contends she also had
back and neck injuries.

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs 4, Capitals 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A battle of division leaders produced a wild,
thrill-a-minute game, with the Toronto Maple Leafs holding off the
Washington Capitals 4-3 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Four Toronto players scored, three after blatant defensive
errors, as the Maple Leafs built a three-goal lead and staved off a
third-period rally.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved Northeast Division-leading Toronto (96 points)
within one point of Southeast Division-leading Washington (97) in
the seeding race for the Eastern Conference playoffs. New Jersey
leads the Atlantic Division with 99 points.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Thomas, Jonas Hoglund, Yanic Perreault and Sergei Berezin
scored for the Maple Leafs, who played their third game in four
nights and had lost four of six. Curtis Joseph stopped 24 shots,
including a momentum-changing kick save on Ulf Dahlen's penalty
shot in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Down 4-1 after two periods, the Capitals rallied with goals from
Steve Konowalchuk and Glen Metropolit with 11:07 to play. It was
Metropolit's second of the game and fifth this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals outshot the Maple Leafs 11-5 in the third, but
couldn't get the equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals, who lost in overtime to Pittsburgh on Thursday,
have lost consecutive games at home for the first time since
October. It was only the fifth time all season that the Caps have
failed to gain a point in a home game.
</P>
<P>
   The game's first score came at 3:57 of the first when Thomas'
slap shot from the point caught goalie Olaf Kolzig off guard.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolit tied it on a more dramatic play. Joe Reekie's shot
from the point was deflected high in the air and fell into the
crease. Metropolit got to the puck before Joseph did, poking it in
at 7:19.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph stopped Dahlen on the penalty shot just 21 seconds later.
The shot was awarded when a Toronto player covered the puck in the
crease.
</P>
<P>
   Mats Sundin and Hoglund worked a 2-on-1 break for Hoglund's
score at 18:53 of the first, and Perreault, sprung on a neutral
zone pass from Dimtri Yushkevich, outraced Dahlen on a breakaway to
put Toronto up 3-1 at 5:44 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   Berezin got the fourth from close range at 9:57 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Caps mounted their comeback when Konowalchuk scored 2:43
into the third, and Metropolit flipped in a backhand off a rebound
on a power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals played without right wing Peter Bondra, day-to-day
with a shoulder strain, and center Andrei Nikolishin, day-to-day
with a recurring abdominal strain.
</P>
<P>
   Washington coach Ron Wilson complained that he was tired of
seeing basketball results rotating with hockey results on the MCI
Center's scoreboard, interfering with Wilson's scoreboard-watching
during the Capitals' playoff chase. On Saturday, nothing but hockey
results were shown, wiping even the NCAA's Final Four off the
scoreboard.

<HEADLINE> Radio Host Art Bell Retiring  </HEADLINE>
By BART JONES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Radio talk show host Art Bell announced
Saturday that he is retiring for a second time -- and for good --
because of false allegations that he is a child molester.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, whose ''Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell'' is America's
most popular overnight radio program, made the announcement to his
estimated 15 million listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ''For myself, an ordeal looms ahead to clear my good name of
accusations I committed a crime, committed against my own son,''
Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said his son, Art Bell IV, was kidnapped and raped in 1997
by a substitute high school teacher who was infected with the AIDS
virus. The boy was 16 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, Brian Lepley, was sentenced in May 1998 to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality that, after suffering the fate of my son's own
molestation, I now stand destined to be tainted for life as a child
molester, has proven simply too much to bear,'' the Nevada-based
broadcaster said. ''God knows, I have tried.''
</P>
<P>
   His last broadcast will be the night of April 26 and the
retirement will be permanent, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's program, heard on more than 400 stations nationwide,
deals with topics ranging from space aliens to FBI and CIA
conspiracies. The program will continue with a new host, said
Premiere Radio Network, Inc., which syndicates ''Coast to Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell first announced his retirement in October 1998,
mysteriously citing ''a threatening, terrible event'' suffered by
his family but offering no details. Two weeks later, he was back on
the air.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Bell said the event was the attack on his son,
which sent his family into a deep crisis and the teen-ager into a
''psychological tailspin which continues to this very day,'' Bell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell also alleged that a few months after the attack, WWCR, a
worldwide Christian short-wave radio station based in Nashville,
Tenn., allowed the broadcast of false rumors that he is a child
molester.
</P>
<P>
   Such rumors have spread, Bell said, and he continues to receive
on-air calls from listeners asking if he is child molester.
</P>
<P>
   Bell broadcasts his program out of his home in the small desert
farming community of Pahrump, 60 miles northwest of Las Vegas.

   Kemp, who missed his first five shots, scored eight points in

and sparked the Cavaliers early in the final quarter. His driving
layup to finish a fast break tied the score at 84 and capped a
22-12 run that started late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson had 12 points in the fourth quarter and put Cleveland
ahead to stay at 92-89 with 5:42 to play with a three-point play.
</P>
<P>
   Boston pulled within 102-100 on a driving shot by Kenny Anderson
with 1:03 to play, but Lamond Murray hit a 3-pointer from the
corner 15 seconds later to put Cleveland back in command.
</P>
<P>
   All five of Boston's starters scored in double figures, but the
Cavaliers' reserves held a 51-16 scoring advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cavaliers center Vitaly Potapenko had 19 points and
Anderson scored 18 for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Murray had 11 of his 19 points in the first half for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kemp set a Cleveland team record for free throws in a
season, breaking the mark of 435 by Brad Daugherty in 1990-91. Kemp
was in double figures in both scoring and rebounds for the 31st
time this season. ... At halftime, the Cavaliers honored former
forward Larry Nance as one of the franchise's top five players.
Ex-teammate John (Hot Rod) Williams participated in the ceremony.
... Boston has lost nine in a row in Cleveland; its last win at
Gund Arena was April 4, 1995.

<HEADLINE> Badgers Don't Score, Don't Win  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Wisconsin has never needed more than a
little offense to win. On Saturday, it didn't even have that much.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers' unlikely run through the NCAA tournament came to a
crashing halt with an ineffective offense in a 53-41 loss to
Michigan State. Wisconsin was as strong as ever on defense, but a
near total lack of offense meant a convincing defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never been able to break this team down offensively,''
Badgers coach Dick Bennett said. ''We couldn't score inside and we
didn't get any clean looks outside. They are superb.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the credit must be given to Michigan State's
defense, the Badgers, mediocre on offense at the best of times,
were terrible. There were air balls on layups, drastically wide
3-pointers and a general absence of direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a complete lack of focus,'' guard Travon Davis said.
''Or maybe we were nervous. You can't miss layups and miss open
shots at this stage of the year. It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a late flurry of points allowed Wisconsin to shoot 35
percent from the field and 64 percent from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin also was pounded on the offensive boards. The Badgers
had just two offensive rebounds with the game still in reach, their
second-worst performance of the season. Overall, they were
outrebounded 42-20.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's strategy throughout the tournament's first four
rounds had been to find one player who can consistently hit shots,
get an early lead and protect it with bruising defense.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, only one element of that formula was working. The
Badgers held Michigan State without a field goal in the final 11:42
of the first half and roughed up the Spartans throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State embraced Wisconsin's philosophy by getting a
quick lead, getting the ball to Morris Peterson for big points and
keeping Wisconsin out of the game with defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started getting tight after I missed, like, my first 10
shots,'' said leading scorer Mark Vershaw, who was 2-of-11 from the
field. ''I got good shots, but they just wouldn't fall.''
</P>
<P>
   As it did through most of the season, Wisconsin lacked a go-to
guy Saturday. Earlier in the tournament, Division II transfer Jon
Bryant had emerged from an unproductive season to average 16.8
points.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was nearly invisible Saturday, throwing up an air ball on
his first 3-point attempt and going scoreless until hitting a layup
with 5:40 to play. He finished 1-of-5 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was so hard to get open,'' Bryant said. ''I took a couple
of shots where I was just throwing it up. I was coming off screens
and looking for my shot, and it just wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard them say they were going to put four guys on me if
necessary. That's what it felt like out there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bryant sat on the bench shaking his head in disgust, the
rest of the Badgers failed to pick up the slack. Roy Boone scored
18 points, but Boone's nine in the first half and freshman Kirk
Penney's two 3-pointers were the only significant points until the
game was out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   All the problems added up to the Badgers' fourth loss to the
Spartans in seven weeks. When asked to name the last time he felt
so completely helpless on offense, Bryant grimaced and replied,
''Probably the last time we played Michigan State.''

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Seek Answers to Mass Murder  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANUNGU, Uganda (AP) -- ''Let us go and burn.''
</P>
<P>
   The ominous words, scrawled across a blackboard in a sect
compound where 530 people were incinerated two weeks ago, might
have sufficed as a neat, if tragic, explanation for the fate of
followers of a Christian fringe sect whose end-of-the-world
prediction had failed to come true.
</P>
<P>
   Then, three days later, the mutilated, strangled bodies of six
men were discovered stuffed into a latrine pit nearby. That led to
a search that unearthed 388 more bodies this week and transformed
an apparent mass suicide into the deadliest cult tragedy of modern
times.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain how the killings of 924 or more people were
orchestrated, all within a 50-mile radius among luxuriant green
hills and volcanic lakes in southwestern Uganda. But police think
they know who masterminded them: Credonia Mwerinde, a 48-year-old
sect leader known as ''the Programmer.'' Authorities believe she is
still alive and on the run.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was that Mwerinde who had all those people killed,'' said
the Rev. Paul Ikazire, a Roman Catholic priest who had left the
church and joined Mwerinde's sect from 1991 to 1994. He said she
was ''obsessed with the desire to obtain the property of her
followers.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews this week across southwestern Uganda, friends and
acquaintances -- even a former common-law husband -- portrayed
Mwerinde as ingenious and greedy. Like an African version of the
religious huckster Elmer Gantry, she founded a religious movement
and sold her spiritual wares to the gullible and the searching,
particularly among the ranks of disaffected Roman Catholics. She
gained daunting power over nearly 1,000 yielding followers, many of
whom apparently later became her victims.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, she had risen from grinding poverty and a
fourth-grade education to become the owner of a shop that sold
banana beer and bootleg liquor, earning a reputation for
promiscuity and cunning along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was able to fool many people,'' said Nalongo Rukanyangira,
a childhood friend in Kanungu, 160 miles southwest of the capital,
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
   As an ''apostle'' of the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten
Commandments of God, Mwerinde secured the loyalty of sect members --
and their possessions -- by invoking visions she claimed to receive
from the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Rukanyangira said Mwerinde once played her a cassette with a
voice purportedly that of the Virgin Mary proclaiming that she was
using Mwerinde to spread the Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been no coincidence Mwerinde began receiving her
visions only weeks after her business went bankrupt in mid-1988,
according to her former common-law husband and business partner,
Eric Mazima.
</P>
<P>
   Once recruits joined, they were subjected to a draconian regimen
that divided mothers from children and husbands from wives and
deprived followers of sleep and food. A code of silence that
allowed members to communicate only with hand signals and a ban on
visits from outsiders served to quell discontent and challenges to
her authority.
</P>
<P>
   Mwerinde's success was evident in her widening girth -- an
attractive sign of wealth to Ugandans -- and the expansion of the
sect compound at Kanungu from one to 12 buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was fat and smart. She grew fatter,'' Mazima said.
</P>
<P>
   On March 14, three days before the Kanungu inferno, Rukanyangira
entered the compound and caught a glimpse of what her friend had
become: Dressed completely in red, Mwerinde handed out red sandals
to followers who, one by one, came in silence to kneel at her feet.
</P>
<P>
   For all the sway Mwerinde held over sect members, what still
defies certainty is why a charlatan may have become a mass
murderer. The reason for the slayings one month ago at sect
compounds in nearby Rugazi, Buhonga and Rushojwa is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   No sect member, past or present, has confirmed the common
belief: that the failure of the world to end Dec. 31 spurred
members to demand belongings they had surrendered to Mwerinde to
join the sect. In turn, the reasoning goes, that inspired an
insurrection that was put down with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Events leading up to the March 17 conflagration in Kanungu
suggest a well-conceived plan -- ''mass suicide'' as an alibi to
cover up murders of nearly 400 men, women and children that already
had been committed over the previous two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in early March, the sect started liquidating its
assets. Neighbors say movement members sold at least 100 head of
cattle and communal furniture and held sales at two of the sect's
local shops.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. the night before the fire, the sect's farm manager
walked into the Kanungu police station and left the title to the
compound's land and a cryptic goodbye note, according to local
constable Willy Abiku.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, local police say, a teen-age sect member named
Peter saw a man nailing shut the wooden windows of the chapel.
</P>
<P>
   At about 10 a.m., Annet Kamkune told police, she saw
white-and-green-robed sect members processing from the newly built
church to the chapel. They chased her away, saying she couldn't
join them for ''prayers'' because she wasn't a member.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the narrow, brick-and-tin-roofed building was
engulfed in flames. Running from his farm, the last words Pius
Kabaireho heard from among the 530 people burning inside were, ''Oh
Mama.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for the bodies of six men found in the compound's
latrine, the notion that a peculiar Christian sect with hopes for
the end of the world had immolated itself might have prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Why were the six men slain? Did they kill the others, then fall
victim themselves? How could so few people strangle and bury so
many?
</P>
<P>
   And one more mystery: Who wrote the words ''Let us go and burn''
and, inches away, ''Let us kill ourselves''?
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with so many questions about this murder on a
grand scale, authorities don't have the answer.

<HEADLINE> Report: Prostitutes Brought to U.S.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- As many as 50,000 women and children from Asia,
Latin America and Eastern Europe are brought to the United States
under false pretenses each year and forced to work as prostitutes,
abused laborers or servants, according to a CIA report, The New
York Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-page report -- ''International Trafficking in Women to the
United States: A Contemporary Manifestation of Slavery'' -- paints a
broad picture of this hidden trade and of the difficulties that
government agencies face in fighting it, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
   Completed in November, the report is based on more than 150
interviews with government officials, law enforcement officers,
victims and experts in the United States and abroad, as well as
investigative documents and a review of international literature on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have seen episodic evidence for years
of trafficking in immigrant women and children, some as young as 9
years old.
</P>
<P>
   But the report says that officers generally do not like to take
on these cases because they are difficult to investigate and
prosecute. What is more, it says, the nation does not have
sufficient laws aimed at this problem, meaning that the penalties
often are insubstantial, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   While the report is not classified, it has not been made public.
Another government official who wanted the report's findings
publicized provided a copy to the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Attorney General Janet Reno chartered an
interagency task force, saying, ''We are not interested in
containing modern-day slavery; we want to eradicate it.''
</P>
<P>
   The report mentions many efforts to fight the problem, but also
many barriers to doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, while up to 100,000 victims poured into
the United States, where they were held in bondage, federal
officials estimated that the government prosecuted cases involving
no more than 250 victims.
</P>
<P>
   The report describes case after case of foreign women who
answered advertisements for au pair, sales clerk, secretarial or
waitress jobs in the United States but found, once they arrived,
that the jobs did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they were taken prisoner, held under guard and forced
into prostitution or peonage. Some of them were, in fact, sold
outright to brothel owners, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Frank E. Loy, undersecretary of state for global affairs, told a
Congressional subcommittee in February: ''It seems incomprehensible
that at the dawn of the 21st century, the primitive and barbaric
practice of buying and selling human beings occurs at all. Yet
international trafficking in persons, predominantly women and
children, is widespread and, by all indications, a growing
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The countries that are the primary sources for traffickers are
Thailand, Vietnam, China, Mexico, Russia and the Czech Republic,
the report says.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin Just Needed More Baskets  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Baskets seemed like happy accidents. The
best action almost always took place away from the ball. All that
was missing from this Big Ten run-in was snow on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State 53, Wisconsin 41 would have been a great game --
if they were playing football.
</P>
<P>
   ''Win or lose, when you play Wisconsin,'' Spartans guard Mateen
Cleaves said, ''it's going to be an ugly game.''
</P>
<P>
   It could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Cleaves, one of the best playmakers in the country,
had zero assists. His team had a total of one. That's because they
had only a half-dozen baskets -- on 6-for-24 shooting. They were
missing so badly, in fact, that Michigan State coach Tom Izzo must
have been relieved when most of them walked into the locker room
and landed on their stools.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of the usual halftime session,'' he said, ''we had a
little kiss-and-hug.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Spartans' confidence was fragile, imagine what must have
been going on across the hall. Wisconsin had three assists -- all of
17 points. And still only trailed by two.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started getting tight after I missed, like, my first 10
shots,'' the Badgers' Mark Vershaw said. ''That's natural.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the Badgers' leading scorer talking.
</P>
<P>
   There are precious few teams in college basketball that a
ballplayer can say that about and not open himself up to ridicule.
The Spartans are at the top of that list, or very near it.
</P>
<P>
   Vershaw averages only 11 points a game, but in four meetings
with Michigan State, he managed that many exactly once. The same
number of times Wisconsin cracked the 50-point barrier. The
Spartans defend so well that occasionally their fans lapse into
chants of ''Dee-fense, Dee-fense'' -- when Michigan State has the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know how incredible they are,'' Wisconsin guard Mike Kelley
said. ''It's not nice to have to say it in this situation, but they
dominated us on both ends again.''
</P>
<P>
   Contempt isn't the only thing familiarity breeds. Barely six
minutes into the game, Kelley, the two-time Big Ten defender of the
year, tried to attach himself like a Band-Aid to the elbow of
Michigan State's best scorer, Morris Peterson. To scrape Kelley
off, Peterson ran through three screens.
</P>
<P>
   The first Spartan tried to slow Kelley down by grabbing his
jersey as he went by. The second planted an elbow in Kelley's
chest. The third provided a facial -- without an appointment. The
whole sideshow went for naught when Aloysius Anagonye stepped in
front of a pass directed for Peterson and rolled in a layup.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much was the way offense was played all night --
accidentally. Sensing that, Izzo instructed Cleaves to take the air
of the ball. Michigan State was leading 17-8 at the time. It almost
backfired. The Spartans went the last 11:42 of the first half
without a basket.
</P>
<P>
   ''We kind of got dysfunctional out there. We made a few bad
plays in a row and I heard that voice,'' Cleaves said, stealing a
glance at Izzo, ''and so I just slowed it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The players will be the first to say that games like this one
are only slightly more entertaining on the floor than on the tube.
</P>
<P>
   When Cleaves hugged the Wisconsin players after beating them for
the third time earlier this month in the final of the conference
tournament, his affection was genuine. But only because he believed
then he was seeing the Badgers for the final time in college
career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I know I won't play them again,'' he said Saturday night.
''Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzo, too, hoped to avoid a fourth meeting. But once it was
inevitable, he changed his rebounding strategy. The Spartans had
been outrebounded only twice all season, but one of those teams was
the Badgers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you are physical with Wisconsin, it really works in their
favor,'' he said. ''So we worked on hitting and spinning instead of
just standing and trying to fist-fight them.''
</P>
<P>
   All that spinning bamboozled the referees -- even if nobody else
was fooled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those were not Big Ten refs,'' Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany
felt obligated to point out.
</P>
<P>
   ''And no,'' he added, anticipating the next question, ''that's
not the most physical game I've seen this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us would hate to see that one -- assuming he's
talking about basketball. There was less than three minutes left to
play when Cleaves stood at the foul line and one of the referees
hissed under his breath, ''Quit fouling, here,'' as though he'd
been watching some other game up until that moment.
</P>
<P>
   It was too late to make a difference, way too late for Wisconsin
to find an answer for a team that manhandled it over and over and
over, too late to find an offense to make the result respectable.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Boone flipped home an unlikely shot with 35 seconds left,
then added a free throw for the 3-point play that gave the Badgers
their final total of 41 points. Small as it seemed, it was still
enough to better their point total the last time they reached the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   That was in a 39-34 win over Washington State. To almost no
one's surprise, it came in 1941, when nobody scored much, and even
fewer people cared.

<HEADLINE> Michigan State 53, Wisconsin 41  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Michigan State would have been just as good
in the days before dazzling dunks and the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans won a Final Four game that could have been played
in another era, beating Big Ten rival Wisconsin for the fourth time
this season and moving within one victory of their first national
title since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   An inspired Morris Peterson provided most of the offense and
Michigan State countered Wisconsin's in-your-face defense and
slowdown offense for a bruising 53-41 victory Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they may be the best defensive team in the country,''
said Jon Bryant, who scored only two points for Wisconsin.
''Everyone talks about their offense, and they forget about the
defense. But they can play some good defense. They kept proving it
against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State (31-7), which has been focused on a title since
losing to Duke in the national semifinals a year ago, advanced to
Monday night's championship against Florida. The Gators beat North
Carolina 71-59 in the second semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got one more shining moment,'' said star point guard
Mateen Cleaves, who returned for his senior season for a chance to
win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State failed to score a field goal for the final 11:42
of the first half. It didn't matter in a game dominated by picks
and bricks -- appropriate in the home of the Brickyard.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans led only 19-17 at the half, falling short of the
score posted in the 1941 title game when Wisconsin was up 21-17
over Washington State en route to the Badgers' only national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   But Michigan State matched every elbow and forearm thrown by the
Badgers (22-14), limiting them to a single basket through the first
7:24 of the second half. Meantime, Peterson scored 10 points during
a 13-2 spurt that pushed the lead to 32-19.
</P>
<P>
   Against a team of limited offensive means like Wisconsin, a
13-point lead was as good as 30.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always somebody on you with a hand in your face,''
Bryant said. ''You get a split-second to get a shot up and you're
not always getting a good look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, the only top seed to reach the Final Four, won
its lone national title 21 years ago with Magic Johnson at point
guard, beating Indiana State and Larry Bird in the final. Johnson
watched this game from the green-clad Spartans section.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to give credit to Pete,'' Cleaves said. ''When he is
hitting his shots, we just get out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson scored 20 points just two days after attending his
grandmother's funeral. He said Friday that she would have the best
seat at the RCA Dome, and he put on quite a show in her honor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be real special for us taking court one more time,''
Peterson said. ''Hopefully, we will make something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers shot only 35 percent (15-of-43) and had just one
player in double figures, Roy Boone with 18 points. Most of those
came in the final minutes when the outcome was already decided.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Wisconsin coach Dick Bennett said his team had not
figured out a way to score against Michigan State. The Badgers
still haven't and were held to the lowest point total of any Final
Four team since the shot clock was introduced in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, the MVP of the West Regional after averaging 16.8 points
and shooting 50 percent from the field, was 1-of-5 from the field.
The Spartans made it difficult for him to even get off a shot --
much less make it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just didn't get it done,'' Bennett said. ''They're better
than us, and we knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers, one of two No. 8 seeds at Indy, finished a
remarkable run after getting into the tournament from the bubble.
They knocked out top-seeded Arizona in the second round of the West
Regional, then made it to Indy by defeating Purdue in another
All-Big Ten matchup.
</P>
<P>
   But Wisconsin, the sixth-place team in the Big Ten, wasn't quick
enough or athletic enough to handle the Spartans. Michigan State
won both regular-season meetings and defeated the Badgers again in
the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State is capable of playing defense with the stingiest
of teams, and it simply had too many offensive weapons for the
Badgers, who lost the four games between the teams by an average of
nearly 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were OK at halftime, but Peterson got it going and we just
never finished,'' Bennett said. ''I thanked (the players) for this
great run and apologized to them for all the goofy things I say to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State dominated the boards, outrebounding Wisconsin
42-20 in a virtual replay of their first meeting this season. That
choked off one of the Badgers' prime objectives for creating
offensive chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans had 14 offensive rebounds and limited Wisconsin to
only two. Andre Hutson led with 10 rebounds, Charlie Bell had
eight, Peterson and A.J. Granger seven apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ''They killed us on the boards,'' said 6-foot-8 Wisconsin
forward Andy Kowske, who failed to grab a rebound during his 20
minutes on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State shot 35 percent (16-of-46) as well and overcame a
subpar game by Cleaves. He scored 11 points -- but nine of those
came on free throws. He was 1-of-7 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, meanwhile, was 7-of-15, including Michigan State's
only two baskets from outside the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed like every time we started to make a run and get
back in the game,'' Wisconsin's Mark Vershaw said, ''Peterson came
up with the big basket.''

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace calls on Canadians to boycott Kellogg foods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Contending genetically modified ingredients in
popular Kellogg products may jeopardize children's health,
Greenpeace Canada Saturday urged Canadian consumers to boycott the
cereal giant's products.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kellogg marketing targets children with its use of friendly
icons like Tony the Tiger. The truth is, the company is selling
products which may risk the health of its consumers, including
children,'' Greenpeace executive director Peter Tabuns told a rally
at a downtown supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically modified foods are the result of gene-splicing
technology that inserts part of the gene strand of one life form,
such as a bacteria or animal, into another, such as corn, soybean
or canola.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace and other environmental and consumer groups have
condemned the use of genetically modified material, highlighting
concerns about a lack of comprehensive testing of the new foods.
</P>
<P>
   But Christine Lowry, a Kellogg spokeswoman, says the company has
every confidence in Health Canada's standards and testing policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have one of safest regulatory systems in world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers should feel quite confident in the Canadian system,
it's the standard that the rest of the world looks to.''
</P>
<P>
   Tabuns said Kellogg can be persuaded to eliminate genetically
modified ingredients, since it has already done so in the products
it distributes in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they can do it in the U.K., then Canadian consumers deserve
the same assurance. No more double standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowry said Kellogg's U.K. products come from different sources,
and there's little chance what happened there would effect what
Kellogg does in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident and supportive of Health Canada's policies.
We support all of the government activity that is going on.''

<HEADLINE> MetroStars 3, United 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Adolfo Valencia scored a goal and
added an assist Saturday night as the New York-New Jersey
MetroStars beat defending Major League soccer champion D.C. United
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars (1-1), who drew an announced crowd of 27,322 for
their first home game since signing German national team star
Lothar Matthaeus, went ahead when Alex Comas converted a penalty
kick in the 11th minute. Referee Ricardo Valenzuela awarded the
penalty and issued a yellow card for dissent to D.C. captain Jeff
Agoos after defender Carey Talley dragged down Valencia in the
penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kelly made it 2-0 in the 23rd, putting the rebound of a
Valencia shot past goalkeeper Tom Presthus.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia, cut from Colombia's national team last week, scored on
a diving header in the 56th minute off a curving left-footed free
kick by Mark Chung. The MetroStars were awarded the free kick after
Matthaeus was fouled just outside the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   United (0-2), which has won three of four MLS titles, scored its
first goal of the year in the 63rd minute when Jaime Moreno
converted a penalty kick after Matthaeus pulled him down.
</P>
<P>
   United was without Marco Etchverry, serving a one-game
suspension for his ejection in last week's season-opening 4-0 loss
to Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Rallies For Health Care Reform  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTIAN H. GEHRKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Banging drums and chanting ''HMOs got to
go,'' about 200 critics of managed health care rallied Saturday to
demand reform.
</P>
<P>
   A hearse led demonstrators down a Hollywood street while
doctors, nurses and patients carried signs with grim messages, such
as ''Widowed by HMO.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We want a dialogue with Congress because managed care is
killing patients,'' said Dr. Ronald Bronow, a rally organizer.
''We'll keep on doing this, they'll keep on hearing from us. This
is the start of a patient revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of demonstrators did not come close to the 5,000
originally predicted for the rally, which was part of a nationwide
effort by the groups Physicians Who Care and the National Coalition
of Mental Health Professionals and Consumers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people promised they would come,'' said Dr. Charles D.
Goodman. ''But because the weather is so nice today, they didn't
show up.''
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California, about 50 people showed up for a San Jose
protest.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, Cincinnati Vice Mayor Minette Cooper presented a
proclamation offering civic support for the cause of health care
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Linda Peeno of Louisville, Ky., a former managed care
company doctor, said she quit her six-figure job in protest of the
current health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I denied thousands of patients care,'' Peeno said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, said a quality system of
health care delivery ought to be a right of every citizen in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Gator Team Packed With Seniors  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- After spending a week preparing for
Wisconsin's throwback offense, Michigan State has one day to get
ready for Florida's racehorse game in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The senior-laden Spartans, champions of the Big Ten conference,
play for the national championship against the Gators, whose roster
is bulging with freshmen and sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State survived a bruising battle with Wisconsin 53-41,
a game that sometimes seemed to be played in quicksand with lids on
the baskets. And then they were joined in the final by Florida,
whose run-and-gun attack wore down North Carolina, 71-59.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are two opposites,'' Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said
of the difference between the Badgers and Gators. ''It will be
opposite styles from what we've had to prepare for.''
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Mateen Cleaves, who returned for a final season at
Michigan State and one last run at a national championship, knows
the Spartans are in for a track meet against the pressing game of
the Gators, the first No. 5 seed to make it to a national
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've watched Florida play all year,'' he said. ''They play
intense defense. They're going to be in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the style of the Gators, who were a fraction of a second
away from washing out of the NCAA tournament in their first game
against Butler. Mike Miller saved them with a game-winning basket
with three-tenths of a second left in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Florida knocked off No. 4 Illinois, No., 1 Duke and
No. 3 Oklahoma State to win the East Region. Against North
Carolina, they used the same formula, running the floor, using
their depth and speed to wear down the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   They built a 15-point lead early, saw it disappear, and then
reconstructed a comfortable margin, using their depth to wear out
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State led by just two points against Wisconsin at the
half but then pulled away in the second half to beat the Badgers
for the fourth time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first half, we weren't playing as aggressive as we should
have,'' said Morris Peterson, who led the Spartans with 20 points.
''In the second half, we started playing with a sense of urgency.
We started realizing that they could be our last 20 minutes if we
didn't pick it up.''

<HEADLINE> Florida 71, North Carolina 59  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- With relentless energy and stifling
pressure, Florida wore down yet another opponent and will play for
its first national title.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators, using the same 10-man rotation, full-court press and
balanced scoring that brought them to the Final Four, ended North
Carolina's improbable tournament run with a 71-59 victory Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (29-7) will meet Michigan State, which beat Wisconsin
53-41, in Monday night's national championship game at the RCA
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Brett Nelson led the Gators with 13 points, while Mike
Miller and Udonis Haslem added 10 each.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our guys played with great intensity,'' Florida coach Billy
Donovan said. ''North Carolina did a great job to get back into it.
I'm just proud of the kids to get this far.''
</P>
<P>
   An 18-3 lead in the opening eight minutes made it look as though
the fifth-seeded Gators wouldn't need the late edge that brought
them earlier wins over higher-seeded teams like Illinois, Duke and
Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tar Heels (22-14), an eighth seed who many felt
shouldn't have even made the tournament field but found their way
to a record-tying 15th Final Four, were back in the game by
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really battled. I think we did wear out there,'' North
Carolina coach Bill Guthridge said. ''This team gave us a great
ride to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels had a 50-46 lead with 13:31 to play.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina point guard Ed Cota picked up his fourth foul
just 13 seconds later and despite not being removed the game, his
lack of aggressiveness played into Florida's hands. The rest of the
Tar Heels now had to handle the pressure and it helped wear them
down. The Gators took the lead for good on a 3-pointer by Major
Parker with 11:02 left and that started a 9-4 run.
</P>
<P>
   During that span North Carolina managed just one field goal
mostly because Cota, who finished with eight assists, just wasn't
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said midway through the second half, ''about the
10-minute mark, we started to wear them down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels, making their third Final Four appearance in four
years, have lost four straight national semifinal games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe he did cost us a basket or two, but we had to have Ed in
there,'' Guthridge said of the decision to keep his point guard in
the game. ''What hurt us was on the offensive side when we couldn't
seem to get a basket after we got that lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Haywood had 20 points, 16 in the first half, for the Tar
Heels, while freshman Joseph Forte had 15, 13 in the second half --
and 10 of those came in an early two-minute burst.
</P>
<P>
   This was Florida's second Final Four appearance, the first -- in
1994 -- ended with a semifinal loss to North Carolina's archrival,
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the 34-year-old Donovan, only the sixth man to play and
coach in a Final Four, these Gators have run by their opponents
after surviving a 69-68 first-round scare from Butler. Miller won
that game with a shot at the buzzer, and Florida got to practice on
Butler's home court this week in preparation for the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's 3-pointer came less than a minute after he and Forte
were charged with double technicals for an incident under the
basket. Nelson sandwiched a jumper and a 3-pointer around a 3 by
Forte to keep the deciding run going.
</P>
<P>
   Florida finished with a 43-42 rebound advantage with Brent
Wright, Donnell Harvey and Miller each grabbing seven. Haywood led
the Tar Heels with 12 and Jason Capel added 10.
</P>
<P>
   Florida finished 25-for-64 from the field (39 percent), the 17th
straight opponent North Carolina has held under 50 percent. But the
Tar Heels struggled themselves, shooting 35 percent (20-for-57).
</P>
<P>
   Florida jumped to the 18-3 lead as the Tar Heels struggled from
the field, making one of their first eight shots, and with the
ball, committing five turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought our guys had great intensity to start the game.
North Carolina took some ill-advised shots,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan Weaks' 3-pointer with 11:43 to play in the first half
gave the Gators the 15-point lead, but North Carolina made four of
its next five shots and Haywood's layup on a pass from Cota had the
Tar Heels within 21-17 with 7:50 left.

<HEADLINE> Lightning 3, Panthers 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Scott Mellanby scored with 1:36 remaining
in regulation as the Florida Panthers rallied from two goals down
to tie Tampa Bay 3-3 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Florida outshot Tampa 12-1 in the third period after trailing
3-1 after two periods. Mellanby slid the puck past Zac Bierk off a
nice feed by Mark Parrish, who was inside the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Johnson scored a pair of goals and had an assist for Tampa
Bay in the physical contest. Vincent Lacavalier added a pair of
assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, with Washington's 4-3 loss to Toronto, pulled
within four points of the Capitals for the Southeast Division
title.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning ended a nine-game losing streak in the series
dating to March 21, 1998. Tampa Bay had notched only one win in the
prior 14 meetings between the clubs. The Lightning haven't won a
road game from the Panthers since April 10, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning dropped to 0-7-9 in overtime. The Panthers are
2-21-2 when trailing after two periods.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, coming off an impressive 6-3 victory over
playoff-bound Ottawa, jumped out to a 1-0 lead on Johnson's 18th
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Holzinger took the initial shot, which Mike Vernon
stopped, but Vernon didn't cover the puck and Johnson skated in and
poked it into the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers tied it at 1 just 2:38 into the second period on
Ray Whitney's 26th goal. Whitney scored after a shot by Robert
Svehla from the slot caromed off the back boards. Whitney reached a
new career high with 66 points.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bure assisted on Whitney's goal, extending his scoring
streak to 11 games. It's his second such streak of the year,
becoming the only player in the NHL this season to accomplish the
feat. Bure, with two assist, is the first Panthers player to reach
90 points.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was marred by dirty play that included 62
minutes of penalties, 47 by Florida, and game misconducts issued to
Florida's Brad Ference and Mike Sillinger, who was traded from
Tampa March 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning wound up on a power play due to Ference's original
penalty, for slashing, and took advantage when Todd Warriner scored
to put Tampa up 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's second goal came at 14:24 of the second as he sent a
shot from the slot past Vernon, who had won his five prior starts.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Kvasha scored to make it 3-2 when he rebounded a miss by
Bure that went off Bierk's knees at 5:19 of the third. It was the
first point for Kvasha since Feb. 21 and his first goal since Jan.
21.

<HEADLINE> Saturday's Final Four Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Florida coach Billy Donovan is the sixth man
to play and coach in the Final Four. He was a member of the 1987
Providence team that lost to Syracuse in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The others to appear in the Final Four as a player and coach are
Vic Bubas, Dick Harp, Bob Knight, Bones McKinney and Dean Smith. Of
those, only Knight and Smith played for and coached championship
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, the season's unbelievable,'' Donovan said after
Florida's 71-59 semifinal victory over North Carolina on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our guys had great intensity to start the game, and Carolina
switched their defense a little bit. Carolina came out great to
start the second half. About the 10-minute mark we started to wear
them down a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NEAR-RECORD LOW: Michigan State's 53-41 victory over Wisconsin
marked the fewest combined points in an NCAA semifinal game since
Georgetown beat Kentucky 53-40 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans and Badgers also combined for 36 points in the
first half, the fourth-lowest total in the NCAA semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under the basket was tough,'' Michigan State coach Tom Izzo
said. ''We did a decent job defensively, but we just missed some
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State led 17-8 with 11:37 to go, but managed only two
free throws the rest of the half for a 19-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The record first-half low also involved Wisconsin, which trailed
Pittsburgh 18-14 in 1941. Oregon State and Oklahoma State tied the
mark with 32 points in 1949. Ohio State and Villanova combined for
35 points in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got more movement on offense and got some openings for
Pete,'' Izzo said of the second half, when Morris Peterson had 16
of his 20 points. ''Mateen (Cleaves) ran our break better and we
finally broke them down a little bit with our break.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   OFF THE RIM: Greg Paavola's $2 million shot was just off the
mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Three Rivers, Mich., man, randomly selected to participate
in the annual Gillette 3-Point Challenge, bounced the ball off the
rim between Saturday night's semifinal games. Instead of a $2
million payoff, he had to settle for a $25,000 consolation prize.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was meant to happen it would happen,'' said Paavola, 37,
who planned to use part of his winnings for college tuition for his
three sons.
</P>
<P>
   Paavola was coached by Hall of Famer Rick Barry.
</P>
<P>
   Had he made the 3-pointer, the Gillette Women's Cancers
Foundation, Inc., also would have received $1 million. The company
paid out $2 million last year when Alicia Brown of Riverside,
Calif., hit a 3-pointer during the semifinals in St. Petersburg,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   FACED THEM ALL: Purdue coach Gene Keady has a unique
perspective on the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   His Boilermakers were the only team to play each of the Final
Four teams this season. In the regular season, Purdue beat Florida
and Michigan State, split a pair of games against Wisconsin and
lost to North Carolina. The Boilermakers also lost to Wisconsin in
the Big Ten tournament and in the NCAA regionals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have a Big Ten team in the finals, and I like
that,'' he said. ''And my house-mate in college was Bill Guthridge,
so I like North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Keady said it was ''a shame'' either Michigan State or Wisconsin
had to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like both coaches a lot, and I like their fans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   FACES IN THE CROWD: Among the spectators in the RCA Dome were
Magic Johnson, who led Michigan State to the 1979 championship over
Indiana State, and John Wooden, who began his coaching career at
Indiana State and led UCLA to a record 10 NCAA titles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great. They deserve it,'' Johnson said after the
Spartans' victory over Wisconsin. ''They've worked hard to get
here. Now they've got one more. Their defense has been the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State lost to Duke in the semifinals last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because they were used to it last year, being in the Final
Four, they were more comfortable this year,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the crowd of 43,116 included baseball Hall of Famer
Sandy Koufax, former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali and New York
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. Ali lives in Berrien Springs,
Mich., and has attended several Spartans games in East Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Koufax, who played basketball at Cincinnati, said he had hoped
to see the Bearcats in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''But Kenyon Martin got hurt, so I'm just here to see a good
basketball game,'' Koufax said. ''I love it. I come every year.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   THIRD TIMER: North Carolina was in the Final Four for the
third time in the past four years, and lost in the semifinals each
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels, beaten by Florida 71-59 Saturday night, also lost
to eventual champion Arizona in the 1997 semifinals in the RCA
Dome, and to Utah in the semifinals in 1998. They were upset by
Weber State in the first round last year.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, which had 13 losses this season, got into the
tournament with an at-large bid and a No. 8 seed, which tied its
lowest ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''They really battled and gave it all, but I think we did wear
out there,'' North Carolina coach Bill Gurthridge said. ''This team
gave us a great ride to get here, and I can be proud of a young men
that really held their heads high all year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly wish we could have gotten this one tonight, but we
salute Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's Ed Cota, who was in all three Final Four
losses, had nine points and eight assists but was hampered by foul
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to have Ed in there. It maybe cost us a basket
defensively, but it was on the offensive end we couldn't seem to
get anything going there down the stretch,'' Guthridge said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   FINAL GAME: Jody Silvester's first Final Four game as a
referee was in Michigan State's semifinal victory over Pennsylvania
in 1979, and his last was Saturday night in Florida's semifinal
against North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old official is retiring after four decades as a
college referee. He was assigned last week to one of the two
semifinals in the RCA Dome, but he didn't find out which one until
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Silvester has officiated in every NCAA tournament since 1979,
when Michigan State went on to the beat Indiana State in the
championship game. This year, he also worked the first and second
rounds in Nashville, Tenn., where he officiated the Tulsa-UNLV and
Miami-Ohio State games.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Evacuees Fear Worst Ahead  </HEADLINE>
By GINNY PARKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- Thousands of townspeople hunkered down on the
hard wooden floors of makeshift emergency shelters for yet another
day Saturday as Mount Usu sputtered with more bursts of ash and
volcanic debris.
</P>
<P>
   Speedy orders to get everyone out of danger areas well before
Usu's first eruption won praise for the government. But after four
days in limbo, many evacuees feared the worst was still ahead --
more volcanic spitting and weeks, perhaps months, away from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be hard to keep this up for the long term,'' said
Mutsuko Shimakura, 74, who came with her husband to a rescue center
for people with physical infirmities.
</P>
<P>
   The eruptions, which began Friday, dusted rice fields and other
crops with a blanket of fine, volcanic ash. Authorities have
reported no injuries or damage, but fears remained that that Usu
could spew a deadly mix of gas and rocks -- called a pyroclastic
flow -- that races down slopes and incinerates everything in its
path.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, plumes of white smoke continued to swell into the
sky, many coming from new craters that broke open in the latest
eruptions -- including one 100 yards from village homes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts warned that the changes made in the landscape by the
eruption, such as the craters, would cause long-term concerns for
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly there have been big changes in the topography where
the eruptions occurred,'' said Tadahide Ui, a volcano expert at
Hokkaido University. ''In those areas it will be impossible for
people's lives to go back to the way they originally were.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiromu Okada, also a professor at Hokkaido University, said of
particular concern was the formation of faults at the summit of the
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very anxious about this evidence. Magma is pushing up
the center of this volcano,'' he said, adding there was still the
possibility of a major pyroclastic flow.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15,000 residents have been forced from their homes on
Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island, many leaving their dogs
tied up for what they expected would be only a short absence.
</P>
<P>
   Experts now say that looks increasingly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our opinion that the main magma has yet to surface,''
volcanologist Hiromu Okada, also Hokkaido University, was quoted as
saying by Kyodo News.
</P>
<P>
   While authorities said their biggest problem at first was
providing necessities, they now face a trickier task: soothing
strained nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until yesterday, the main problems were getting food and
baths,'' said care worker Yoshikazu Kiyama. ''Now people are
feeling stress, so we have to provide psychological care. People
are really starting to want to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   At one rescue center in Date, at the volcano's base, men sat
chain-smoking, their faces flushed with alcohol. Other displaced
residents huddled in the next room, whispering in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuees groused at the slightest noise. About 240 people were
packed into one room.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night, an old lady gave me the evil eye when I dropped my
flashlight and woke her up,'' said 15-year-old Masaharu Haru.
</P>
<P>
   Many were growing increasingly nervous about their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband is really stubborn and he didn't want to leave the
house,'' Shimakura said.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the slow and arduous recovery after Mount Usu's last
eruption, in 1978, it is easy to understand residents' fears.
</P>
<P>
   That time, the eruption was declared over nearly five years
after the volcano first burst. It left a huge dent in the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The region's tourism industry suffered $11.3 million in losses,
as well as $2 million in damage. The number of vacationers in the
scenic lake and hot spring resort area reportedly dropped 60
percent in the period. Overall damage, including lost income as
well as destroyed homes, totaled $503 million.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese central and local government officials were praised in
the press for their response to the emergency and credited with
preventing injuries and possibly saving lives.
</P>
<P>
   About 51,000 people live in the coastal city of Date and several
smaller towns near Usu, 475 miles north of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   At the initial signs of growing volcanic activity earlier this
week, officials in nearby villages and towns informed residents of
the imminent danger, urging them to evacuate as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials asked the Self-Defense Forces to help transport
the evacuees, and gave residents maps showing possible danger
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Those who remember Mount Usu's last eruption were pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time, the reaction was completely different,'' said
Tsunaichi Watanabe, 74, a Date resident.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so impressed to see the Self-Defense Forces coming into
the city in their trucks,'' he said, riding a bus back to town.
''When I saw that, I felt it's become a better world.''

<HEADLINE> Maine Reform Party Elects Delegates  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCIS X. QUINN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- The Reform Party of Maine's tiny state
convention on Saturday elected a five-member slate of national
delegates supporting presidential hopeful Patrick Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who has run previously for president as a Republican,
addressed the gathering prior to the voting, as did Natural Law
Party candidate John Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   Outlining a platform emphasizing ''economic nationalism,''
Buchanan said the duty of the federal government in crafting trade
policy must be to ''stand up clearly for America first.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan by turns criticized the Clinton administration and the
Republican-led Congress for failing to effectively counter
production cutbacks by foreign oil producers and trade imbalances
with other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing incursions on U.S. sovereignty by organizations
ranging from the World Trade Organization to the United Nations,
Buchanan declared, ''no global institution is going to tell us
Americans how to govern ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, whose campaign brochures stress his opposition to
abortion, made no mention of that or other social issues during the
opening remarks of his 45-minute presentation to fewer than 100
listeners inside the auditorium of Cony High School.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin, a founder of the Natural Law Party and its presidential
nominee four years ago, offered himself as a candidate who could
represent a fusion coalition drawing on support from the Natural
Law, Reform and Green parties.
</P>
<P>
   With organizational energy that dominated the small gathering,
Buchanan backers prepared a slate of candidates supporting him and
mustered the votes to ensure victory for them.
</P>
<P>
   There were only about 30 voters and after the national delegates
were chosen, less ardent Buchanan supporters and uncommitted
candidates won election to other party posts.
</P>
<P>
   In Manchester, N.H., meanwhile, Buchanan supporters elected
themselves to head the state Reform Party on Saturday but others
claiming the Reform mantle in New Hampshire challenged the validity
of the session.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was not a Reform Party meeting,'' said John Talbott, the
previous acting party chairman who maintained he was not voted out
of office. ''That was a Buchanan for President meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott did not attend the Saturday session where about 80
Buchanan supporters met to elect new party officers. They claimed
Talbott and others had violated the party's by-laws by not holding
regular meetings.

Microsoft-U.S. Gov't Talks Crumble
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Talks between the federal government and Microsoft broke down
today despite assertions by Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates that his company had
made ''significant concessions.'' Federal appeals court Judge Richard Posner
said he was ending his effort to mediate a settlement. Posner said in a
statement that the disagreements are too deep-seated to be bridged. At issue is
a lawsuit filed by the federal government and 19 states alleging that Microsoft
repeatedly engaged in illegal anticompetitive behavior by using monopoly power.
''It's unfortunate that a settlement wasn't possible,'' Gates said in a
conference call.

Volcano Evacuees Fear Worst Ahead
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- Thousands of townspeople hunkered down on the hard wooden
floors of makeshift emergency shelters for yet another day today as Mount Usu
sputtered with more bursts of ash and volcanic debris. Speedy orders to get
everyone out of danger areas well before Usu's first eruption won praise for the
government. But after four days in limbo, many evacuees fear the worst was still
ahead -- more volcanic spitting and weeks, perhaps months, away from their
homes. More than 15,000 residents have been forced from their homes on Hokkaido,
Japan's northernmost main island.

Protesters Oppose Returning Elian
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI, Fla. (AP) -- Even as U.S Attorney General Janet Reno appealed to
Americans not to further politicize the Elian Gonzalez case, about 100
Cuban-Americans protested the Immigration and Naturalization Service order today
to return 6-year-old boy to his father in Cuba. Reno, who favors returning Elian
to his family, spoke to students at the University of Virginia Law School on
Saturday and reiterated her position that the boy's father should have the right
to speak for him. The INS has threatened to revoke the boy's residency status,
but twice last week pushed back a deadline for the relatives to agree, now set
for 9 a.m. Tuesday.

Americans Urged To Comply With Census

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today urged all Americans to participate
in this year's census, and took direct aim at Republicans who have grumbled
about the intrusiveness of some questions. ''Those who suggest that filling out
your census form isn't essential are plainly wrong,'' Clinton said in his weekly
radio address. His remarks coincided with Census Day, the April 1 once a decade
on which Americans are asked to tell the government who and where they are.
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush has said he's not sure he would
fill out the 53-question ''long form,'' which includes questions about income,
education, employment and health.

Political Parties Hunt Campaign Cash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While their likely presidential nominees advocate campaign
finance reform, the political parties are eagerly courting individuals,
corporations and unions willing to contribute $250,000 or more. The Republican
National Committee already reports 51 contributions of at least $250,000 in the
1999-2000 election season, twice as many as during the 1995-96 political
campaign. Figures for the Democrats are incomplete because of a different
reporting system, but their top donor category is the same.

the board of the French bank had unanimously recommended the offer to its

French bank at a price of $144 per share in cash or, as an alternative, 13
shares of HSBC for each Credit Commercial share, valued at approximately $154
each. HSBC said the acquisition would give it a ''significant base for operation

   HOUSTON (AP) -- Cuttino Mobley scored 24 points, Kenny Thomas had
18 points and 22 rebounds, and Kelvin Cato added 21 points and 15
rebounds as the Houston Rockets beat the Atlanta Hawks 115-93

Gene Elstun
</P>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- Gene Elstun, a teammate of Wilt
Chamberlain on the Kansas basketball team that lost in triple
overtime to North Carolina in the 1957 NCAA championship, died
Thursday of pancreatic cancer. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   Elstun, also an accomplished golfer, was a manufacturer's
representative in the golf equipment industry.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Kansas City, Mo., and starred in basketball at
what was then Shawnee Mission Rural High School, now Shawnee
Mission North, captaining the team that won the 1953 state
championship.
</P>
<P>
   As a sophomore at Kansas, the 6-foot-3 Elstun ranked second in
scoring with a 14.2 average. He averaged 12.8 points the following
season.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior in the 1956-57 season, with Chamberlain playing for
the Jayhawks for the first time, Elstun was co-captain of a team
that went 24-3 and made the NCAA Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks, champions of what was then the Big Seven
Conference, beat SMU and Oklahoma City in the regionals and
defeated San Francisco 80-56 in the championship semifinal. That
set up the championship game that North Carolina won 54-53.

Ed McCurdy
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ed McCurdy, a leading 1950s folk music figure
whose songs were recorded by Johnny Cash, Arlo Guthrie and Joan
Baez, died March 23 in Halifax, Novia Scotia. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   McCurdy left his home in Willow Hill, Pa., for New York and a
singing career at age 18. After a failed bid at becoming a Frank
Sinatra-style nightclub singer, McCurdy turned to folk music during
the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, he headlined a series of shows at New York's Village
Vanguard and released his first album, ''Ed McCurdy Sings Songs of
the Canadian Maritimes.'' He later signed a deal with Elektra
Records, where he collaborated with another influential folk
singer, Ramblin' Jack Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, his songs were recorded by a variety of artists that
included Cash, Guthrie, Baez, Pete Seeger, and Simon and Garfunkel.
</P>
<P>
   After his music career waned, McCurdy moved to Nova Scotia in
1984 and became a character actor on Canadian television dramas.

<P>
   RICHFIELD, Minn. (AP) -- Peter Pafiolis, who served as the voice
for the Minnesota Education Association for 27 years and was known
for his passion for language, died Monday. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Pafiolis joined the Minnesota Education Association as public
relations director in 1962 and served the association until 1989.
Before joining the association, he was an education reporter for
the Saint Paul Pioneer Press and Dispatch for eight years and
worked in a different public relations job for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Pafiolis is survived by two daughters, one son and three
grandchildren.

John Robert Starr
</P>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- John Robert Starr, who helped change
the face of Arkansas journalism by leading an underdog newspaper to
victory in a bitter circulation war, died Saturday. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a former Associated Press reporter and bureau chief, died
of an apparent heart attack in Del Norte, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was managing editor of the Arkansas Democrat as it battled
the Arkansas Gazette from 1978 to 1991. When the Democrat purchased
the Gazette's assets, Starr became managing editor of the
Democrat-Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   After 19 years with the AP, including 10 as the news service's
Little Rock bureau chief starting, Starr enrolled in graduate
school at the University of Tennessee in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, he was hired to lead the Democrat, then an afternoon
preparing for a head-to-head battle with the dominant Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were trying to go from being a second newspaper to being an
equivalent newspaper to the Gazette,'' Walter E. Hussman Jr.,
publisher of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   After the newspaper war, Starr remained as managing editor of
the Democrat-Gazette for less than a year -- but kept writing a
column seven days a week until the late 1990s, when he cut back to
three columns a week.
</P>
<P>
   He was often critical of Bill Clinton, both as president and
governor, but was genuinely touched when Clinton sent condolences
this year on the death of Starr's brother Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a real soft side, but he never showed that to the
readers,'' Hussman said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House issued a statement Saturday night in which
Clinton conveyed his condolences to Starr's family and expressed
respect for Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was a sports writer at the Memphis Commercial Appeal
before joining the AP in Little Rock in 1957. He was promoted to AP
bureau chief in 1966 after serving for years as capitol reporter
and news editor.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Norma; two sons, John Starr and
Robert Starr, publisher of the Palatka (Fla.) Daily News; and a
daughter, Linda Starr.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds didn't take long to become the
first player to homer at Pacific Bell Park, and his home-run ball
was rescued by a boat.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds homered on the first pitch he saw from New York's Andy

<HEADLINE> Spartan Team Packed With Seniors  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- After spending a week preparing for
Wisconsin's throwback offense, Michigan State has one day to get
ready for Florida's racehorse game in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The senior-laden Spartans, champions of the Big Ten conference,
play for the national championship against the Gators, whose roster
is bulging with freshmen and sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State survived a bruising battle with Wisconsin 53-41,
a game that sometimes seemed to be played in quicksand with lids on
the baskets. And then they were joined in the final by Florida,
whose run-and-gun attack wore down North Carolina, 71-59.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be opposite styles from what we've had to prepare
for,'' Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida coach Billy Donovan said he'd seen Michigan State
periodically.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going against a team that has tremendous experience,''
he said. ''I think they're a hungry team, just like we are. They're
terrific. They do a great job defensively. They can play any way
you want to play. We've got our hands full. It's a tremendous
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Miller said Florida was ready for the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a great club,'' he said. ''They've got seniors. They
shoot well. We're going to do a good job. Coach already has a
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Mateen Cleaves, who returned for a final season at
Michigan State and one last run at a national championship, knows
the Spartans are in for a track meet against the Gators' pressing
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've watched Florida play all year,'' he said. ''They play
intense defense. They're going to be in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the style of the Gators, the first No. 5 seed to make it
to a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   They were a fraction of a second away from washing out of the
NCAA tournament in their first game against Butler. Mike Miller
saved them with a game-winning basket with three-tenths of a second
left in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Florida knocked off No. 4 Illinois, No. 1 Duke and
No. 3 Oklahoma State to win the East Regional. Against North
Carolina, they used the same formula, running the floor, using
their depth and speed to wear down the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   They built a 15-point lead early, saw it disappear, and then
reconstructed a comfortable margin.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State led by just two points against Wisconsin at the
half, but then pulled away in the second half to beat the Badgers
for the fourth time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first half, we weren't playing as aggressive as we should
have,'' said Morris Peterson, who led the Spartans with 20 points.
''In the second half, we started playing with a sense of urgency.
We started realizing that they could be our last 20 minutes if we
didn't pick it up.''

<HEADLINE> Gators Play Style Takes The Day  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- It was Billy Ball at its finest.
</P>
<P>
   Confuse the opponent early, wear it down late, then walk off
with a victory and, in this case, a shot at a national title
against Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Florida beat North Carolina 71-59 on Saturday night the same way
it has been beating teams all season. Anyone who saw Kentucky win
it all in 1996 with Rick Pitino -- Billy Donovan's mentor -- at the
helm would have found it familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say we've come to expect it,'' Donovan said of the
seeming inevitability that Florida eventually will confuse and
exhaust every team it plays. ''Because you never know. A team may
make it all the way through.''
</P>
<P>
   Not North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators opened the game with their trademark full-court
press, forcing the Tar Heels to commit five turnovers in the first
eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina figured things out after falling behind 18-3.
Behind the 7-foot power of Brendan Haywood and the shooting of Joe
Forte, the Tar Heels climbed into the lead early in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the second part of Donovan's one-two combo started kicking
in.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators, who had been freely substituting all day, still had
legs. The Tar Heels could barely stand on theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's reserves outscored North Carolina's 37-2. But as much
as the points, it was the fatigue that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's our style of play,'' Florida guard Brett Nelson said.
''We might get down six or eight, but we never give up. We just
keep playing and playing and playing. Because we know we might get
a steal and hit a 3, and then, we're right back in it.''
</P>
<P>
   True to Nelson's word, the Gators were at their best soon after
they lost the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Behind 50-46 with 13 minutes left, the Gators held North
Carolina to three field goals. Forte shot two air balls. Some of
his teammates had trouble getting the ball to the rim. Spot-up jump
shots turned into unconvincing floaters, a sure sign of a team
starting to wear down physically.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the press proved just as difficult. The Tar Heels could
slice through Florida's traps by the second half, but used up too
much energy doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Florida was fresh. Coming off the bench, Nelson had
seven points and two assists during a 12-3 run that put the Gators
up for good.
</P>
<P>
   ''We absorbed their blows and countered with our blows,''
Florida's Justin Hamilton said. ''It's something we've done all
year -- wear teams down in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Fouls started plaguing both teams late, but in the true
Donovan-Pitino method, it didn't hurt the Gators as much. The
Florida coach could rotate big men Udonis Haslem and Donnell Harvey
-- both with four fouls -- in and out.
</P>
<P>
   Tar Heels coach Bill Guthridge didn't have that option. Forte,
Ed Cota and Jason Capel all had to play tentatively with four fouls
through the better part of the final 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this was what Donovan had been preaching to his team all
season and to everyone else all this week. The system, he insisted,
would win out when the Final Four rolled around.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not for me to say whether we wore North Carolina out,''
Donovan said. ''I would probably go by what they said after the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Fatigue was a factor,'' Haywood said.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard couldn't have told the story any better.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Mayor Daley Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN LIPMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Mayor Richard M. Daley was hospitalized Saturday
after suffering chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   Daley was alert and in stable condition, but will be kept
overnight for observation at Northwestern Memorial Hospital,
doctors said. A battery of tests came up negative for heart
problems, Dr. Steven DeAngeles said.
</P>
<P>
   Daley's family physician, Dr. Ed Newman, said Daley was
complaining of vague chest discomfort and his blood pressure was
elevated when he was taken to the hospital. His blood pressure had
returned to normal Saturday night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was taken to the hospital from his home at about 3:30
p.m. by paramedics as a precautionary measure on Newman's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had vague discomfort so I thought the advisable thing to do
was to hospitalize him to make sure the mayor was safe and sound,''
Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, 57, had attended a neighborhood policing meeting earlier
Saturday and was resting when the pain began, spokeswoman Jackie
Heard said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he wasn't feeling well earlier in the day,'' Heard
said, ''but then he went on to give a speech to 3,000 people at his
usual pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Rod Sierra said Daley is in good shape and works out
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ''He works out regularly and is in very good shape,'' Sierra
said.
</P>
<P>
   Daley is the son of Chicago's legendary Boss, Mayor Richard J.
Daley, who died of a heart attack in 1976. The younger Daley easily
extended his family's political dynasty last year when he defeated
Rep. Bobby Rush to win a third full term.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's first black mayor, Harold Washington, died of a heart
attack in office in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Report: Redskins Pursuing QB George  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Redskins are prepared to offer
free-agent quarterback Jeff George a multiyear contract, The
Washington Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Post, quoting unidentified sources close to the team, said
George, who spent last season with Minnesota, would be a backup to
former Vikings quarterback Brad Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota coach Dennis Green has said he would like to re-sign
George to a one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Steinberg, George's agent, did not immediately return a
call to The Associated Press on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   George, 32, was 9-3 as a starter last season, leading Minnesota
into the playoffs, where the Vikings lost to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings pursued Dan Marino as a replacement for George, but
the Miami star retired rather than sign with Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets 112, Jazz 92  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Antonio McDyess scored 33 points, Nick Van Exel 27
and rookie James Posey 20 as the Denver Nuggets beat the Utah Jazz
112-92 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets outscored the Jazz in every quarter and never
trailed, withstanding Utah rallies in both the third and fourth
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Raef LaFrentz had 11 rebounds and McDyess 10 for the Nuggets,
who snapped a three-game losing streak to the Jazz. Posey was
6-of-8 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone had 27 points and 13 rebounds for Utah, and Bryon
Russell added 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Utah coach Jerry Sloan was ejected after drawing his second
technical foul with 2:46 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Utah, trailing 47-39 at the half, mounted a 10-2 run early in
the third period to get within two points. Baskets by Malone kept
the Jazz close, but Posey hit consecutive 3-pointers to make it
63-53 with 5:35 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   George McCloud's 3-point basket made it 75-56, and his free
throw on Sloan's first technical gave Denver an 80-60 lead late in
the period.
</P>
<P>
   Russell had two straight 3-pointers early in the final quarter
during Utah's 9-0 run that got the Jazz within 86-74, and another
Russell trey made it 92-83 with 6:14 left. But the Jazz got no
closer as Denver fashioned a 9-0 flurry, including two rebound
baskets by McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   With Posey hitting three 3-pointers, the Nuggets jumped out to
their biggest lead of the half, 25-13 with 3:42 left in the opening
quarter. Utah went on an 8-2 run to cut the deficit to 27-21 at the
end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Vaughn's basket got Utah within 29-25 early in the second
period, but McDyess scored seven points in the period and Denver
took a 47-39 lead at intermission. The Jazz shot only 29 percent in
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Nuggets were without guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad, who
underwent season-ending surgery Friday to repair a torn ligament in
his left wrist. He will be in a cast for eight weeks, then begin
rehabilitation. ... Despite the loss, Utah has won 15 of its last
18 games and 10 of its past 13 road games. ... Denver shot 51
percent compared to Utah's 43 percent and also was 11-of-20 from
3-point range compared to Utah's 5-of-16.

<HEADLINE> Saturday's Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Kenny Lofton's surprising comeback to the field was a
success.
So was Shawn Green's return to Toronto.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lofton returned to the field Saturday less than four months
after undergoing surgery on his left shoulder, starting in center
field in Cleveland's final exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the last hurdle,'' Cleveland general manager John Hart
said. ''It's been amazing (his recovery). The doctor said it was
something that just doesn't happen. It's a medical miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians said it was likely Lofton would start in Monday's
opener at Baltimore, but a final decision would not be made until
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he feels like this tomorrow, we'll open the season with
him,'' Indians manager Charlie Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton had appeared in three exhibition games, all as a
designated hitter, before Saturday. He is 6-for-12 with a home run
and two stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton went 1-for-3 with a walk and two stolen bases in
Cleveland's 6-3 loss to the Braves in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel OK,'' Lofton said. ''I didn't get any balls. It depends
on how I feel tomorrow. If it feels as good as it did today, I can
go ahead and play.''
</P>
<P>
   In the field, Lofton had three routine fly balls -- all with no
runners on base -- so didn't have to throw the ball very hard, and
didn't. He lobbed the ball back to the infield, some 100 feet,
after each catch.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker made a return of sorts as well, pitching at Turner
Field for the first time since offending gays, foreigners and
minorities in a Sports Illustrated article during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker pitched a hitless ninth for the save and was greeted by
mostly cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Green, traded from the Blue Jays to Los Angeles for Raul Mondesi
in the offseason, homered and had an RBI double as the Dodgers won
at Toronto 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely a good way to end things because I had just
had great time up here,'' said Green, who spent five seasons in
Toronto. ''I just didn't want to be gone without returning here for
a long time. It's nice to come back right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Green asked out of Toronto so he could play in his home town.
The Dodgers then signed him to a six year, $84 million contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of fans yelled ''Traitor!'' during his plate
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were some mixed reactions but I felt good about the
responses,'' Green said. ''In my position you hear the boos a bit
more because you pay more attention to that and those fans are the
ones who are more aggressive in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''But definitely there were a lot of cheers and it felt good to
hear that support.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Royals 7, Twins 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Haines City, Fla., Mike Sweeney hit a three-run homer in a
six-run seventh inning to lead Kansas City.
Expos 11, Pirates 4

   At Jupiter, Fla., Carl Pavano allowed two runs in five innings
to win for the fourth time in five spring decisions.
Tigers 15, Devil Rays 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Lakeland, Fla., Juan Guzman, who hadn't pitched since March
18 because of tightness in his upper back, gave up 11 runs -- eight
earned -- eight hits and four walks in 3 2-3 innings.
White Sox 6, Phillies 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Las Vegas, Frank Thomas and Paul Konerko each homered, and
James Baldwin pitched five scoreless innings.

<HEADLINE> Gators Wear Down Tar Heels  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The reaching fouls, missed free throws,
turnovers and the faltering defense down the stretch -- all were
unmistakable signs that North Carolina was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Tar Heels just couldn't keep up with talented
and deep Florida in a 71-59 loss in the NCAA tournament semifinals
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just threw the waves at us and it certainly was a
factor,'' coach Bill Guthridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Starters Joseph Forte and Jason Capel fouled out and Ed Cota and
Brendan Haywood finished with four each. Guthridge surrendered
against the pressing Gators with 15 seconds left, taking out his
remaining starters as North Carolina lost its fourth straight in
the national semifinals dating to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Florida coach Billy Donovan said that midway through the second
half ''about the 10-minute mark, we started to wear them down.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina (22-14) finished with its highest loss total
since going 12-15 in 1951-52 under coach Tom Scott.
</P>
<P>
   After four straight victories in a surprising run as a No. 8
seed, it was suddenly over for the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   ''People called our tournament a fluke,'' Forte said. ''The real
fluke is the way we played in the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina was tied with Florida at 50-50 midway through the
second half, but frustration and foul trouble were not far away.
</P>
<P>
   Cota already had four fouls and was relieved of his
press-breaking duties, while Forte was called for a technical foul
for elbowing Major Parker, who also got a technical.
</P>
<P>
   ''My team wasn't comfortable with me playing with four fouls and
my approach was different,'' said Cota, who finished his career 0-3
in Final Four games. ''I wasn't being as aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Four turnovers later against the press, Florida led 62-54 and
the Tar Heels were gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   ''We started playing up and down -- Florida basketball -- and that
really hurt us,'' Haywood said.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of a comeback faded with two missed free throws by Forte
and one by Haywood with 2:44 left and the Tar Heels down by seven.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they went up seven late, I looked at our guys and it was
clear we didn't have the firepower to (come back) again,'' Forte
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot Haywood scored 16 points in the first half, but had
only four in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the second half our big guys stepped up and didn't do as
much fouling,'' Parker said. ''We followed the game plan, which was
to front him and pack the lane in. We forced him to shoot jump
hooks instead of dunks.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina shot less than 40 percent in each of its last
three Final Four semifinals losses and was headed that way again
after a horrid offensive start against the fired-up Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's press didn't bother the Tar Heels early so much as its
poor shooting, starting 1-for-8 from the field. And while North
Carolina did have six turnovers in the opening eight minutes, most
came down low on balls stripped from the big men.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought our guys had great intensity to start the game,''
Donovan said. ''North Carolina took some ill-advised shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said he was proud to beat two schools from the powerful
Atlantic Coast Conference in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''To beat Duke and to beat Carolina speaks volumes for our
league because those two programs have been models for success,''
Donovan said.

<HEADLINE> Angels Release Tom Candiotti  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Knuckleballer Tom Candiotti was released
Saturday from his minor league contract by the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti, released by Oakland and Cleveland last season, was
1-2 with a 6.85 ERA in nine spring training games.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old signed a minor league contract with the Angels
in January. He had been hampered by a nagging injury to his left
knee last season, but had arthroscopic surgery in August and was
feeling healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The native of Walnut Creek, Calif. has a 151-164 career record
with a 3.73 ERA. The right-hander had pitched in the major leagues
since 1983, most recently with Los Angeles (1992-97) and Oakland
(1998-99).
</P>
<P>
   ''You look at the great knuckleballers who have been in the
game, and some of them pitched on up into their 40s,'' he said last
month. ''Hey, I'm 42, so I'm a young knuckleballer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also set their 25-man opening day roster by
announcing they will purchase the contracts of left-hander Kent
Mercker and infielder Benji Gil from the minor leagues.
