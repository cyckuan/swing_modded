 &HT;    COMMENTARY: GOP undermining of census a shameful hustle
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The demagoguery against the census reached a new low last week
when the U.S. Senate adopted a resolution in effect telling
Americans just to skip any census questions they don't feel like
answering and assuring them they won't be prosecuted, fined or ``in
any way harassed by the federal government'' for taking a hike.
</P>
<P>
   That is, the demagoguery reached a new low so far. It is not
clear that the competition is over.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: the nation's highest deliberative body suborning mass
law-breaking. It is an astonishing sight. The senators also urged
everyone to return the census forms as required by law, but for
covering their tails, that's the legislative equivalent of a string
bikini.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing and, increasingly, the Republican grandstanding
against the census is one of the most shameful political hustles in
years.
</P>
<P>
   It started, as so much damn foolishness does, with radio
talk-show hysterics yelling about a government plot to pry into the
private lives of citizens. To just what nefarious end is unclear,
but surely to some evil purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Like sparks on dry grass, that set off a spreading brush fire of
outrage, and before you could say ``cheap shot,'' politicians of
the more flagrantly irresponsible sort were lining up to pose and
sputter against the Clinton census.
</P>
<P>
   No less than Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott mused that maybe
offended citizens shouldn't bother to answer any questions on the
long form -- one in six of us get those _ that didn't strike their
fancy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no Clinton census. This is the U.S. census,
required by the Constitution every 10 years. The long-form
questions about plumbing, income, disability and more are
traditional and are designed to provide data on which specific
federal programs, enacted by Congress, can be targeted and
budgeted. Members of Congress saw the questions two years ago;
there wasn't a peep against them.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in Washington cares a fig about individual responses, but
the better the data, the more effectively your tax dollars can be
spent. (The talk-show response to that is, ``Aha! Just more
evidence that the government has 'programs.' ``)
</P>
<P>
   The sponsor for the non-compliance resolution was Robert C.
Smith (R-N.H.), who is not exactly the brightest bulb on the
marquee. He complains that asking about race divides us. Right. We
wouldn't know we were of different races if the census didn't force
us to notice.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was non-binding and was passed by a voice vote.
It is, in short, legally meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not politically meaningless. Smith's move dovetails
with other efforts by conservative Republicans to undermine the
census, in part out ofsome odd, ideological kink that anathematizes
it but, more slyly, in hopes of confusing the head count in ways
that may make it possible to skew congressional reapportionment to
conservative advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Beware the politicians who don't want you to be counted. Some
simply don't want you to count.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ADULTERY: And Other Diversions  &LR; By Tim Parks. Arcade, $12.95.
The author displays both storytelling skill and acerbic
self-knowledge as he explores the relationship between moral
constructs and real life in meditations on marriage, European
politics and other topics. The result is ``an elegant demonstration
of the freedom and power of the essay form,'' Robert Grudin wrote
in The New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE STORIES OF J.F. POWERS  &LR; New York Review, $14.95. James Farl
Powers (1917-99) was a Midwesterner whose small output _ three
collections of stories and two novels _ has attracted something of
a cult following. This anthology of his short fiction is populated
by housekeepers, parishioners and, especially, Catholic priests
living out their small-scale dramas in the United States'
heartland. ``His talent was happiest in the concentration, the
focus, of the short story,'' Denis Donoghue wrote in an essay in
The New York Times Book Review last month. ``It was as if he
thought life most clearly disclosed in the telling anecdote.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued Powers' novels.  &UR; MORTE D'URBAN &LR; 
($12.95), which won the National Book Award in 1963, is about a
charismatic, go-getting Chicago priest who is banished by his
superior to the Minnesota outback. ``This is a comic novel, with
some fine slapstick touches,'' Richard Sullivan wrote in 1962. ``It
is at the same time sharply satirical.''
</P>
<P>
   The hero of  &UR; WHEAT THAT SPRINGETH GREEN &LR;  ($12.95) is another
worldly priest who struggles to maintain his dignity and resist the
tug of the secular world in his suburban parish. ``No eye has been
sharper, no ear finer than that of J.F. Powers at discerning the
nuances of service to God and mammon,'' Amy Edith Johnson wrote in
1988. ``The beauty of Powers' writing lies in its art's being
almost invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BROKEN TOWER: A Life of Hart Crane  &LR; By Paul Mariani.
Norton, $15.95. The first biography of the poet in 30 years
re-examines Crane's short, sad life, which ended with his suicide
at 32. It includes frank discussions of his sexuality, his
infatuation with New York City and his difficulty maintaining
friendships. The ``aim isn't to moralize Crane's life but to retell
it as `a great Greek tragedy' in Jazz Age dress,'' Langdon Hammer
wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROBERT FROST: A Life &LR; , by Jay Parini (Owl/Holt, $16), is a
sympathetic look at the cantankerous New England poet who gave up
college (he was a better Latinist than Pound or Eliot) for
subsistence farming and part-time teaching. Last year the reviewer
Christopher Benfey called this a ``sturdy and well-informed''
portrait.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES OF THE CENTURY  &LR; Edited by John
Updike and Katrina Kenison.  &UR;  &LR; Houghton Mifflin, $18.95. Each tale
in this celebration of short fiction appeared in an annual series
called Best American Short Stories, which began in 1915. (A new
story from the 1999 edition has been added.) ``Finding wonderful
stories that you don't already know is one of this collection's
great pleasures,'' Michael Gorra wrote last year. There are ``some
surprising _ even striking _ selections.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LAST THINGS  &LR; By Jenny Offill. Delta, $11.95. The protagonist of
this first novel is a 7-year-old girl who witnesses her mother's
downward spiral into madness, and who tries to make her way through
a claustrophobic world fraught with codes, disguises and mysterious
signs. ``Offill's fresh voice, endearing and quirky, makes you
willingly suspend disbelief,'' Nancy Willard wrote in The New York
Times Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HAUNTED WOOD: Soviet Espionage in America _ the Stalin Era
 &LR; By Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev. Modern Library,
$14.95. Drawing on thousands of secret documents from the Stalin
years, an American scholar and a Russian journalist shed light on
the ``golden age'' of Soviet espionage. ``What emerges most sharply
is proof of the guilt of certain Americans whose spying for the
Soviet Union has been the subject of debate for over half a
century,'' Joseph E. Persico wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MANY THOUSANDS GONE: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in
North America  &LR; By Ira Berlin. Belknap/Harvard University, $16.95. A
historian examines the many forms and meanings of slavery between
the arrival of the first blacks in Virginia in 1619 and the rise of
King Cotton. ``This masterly work ... illuminates the first 200
years of African-American history more effectively than any
previous study,'' George M. Fredrickson wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A TUSCAN CHILDHOOD  &LR; By Kinta Beevor. Vintage Departures, $13.
An Englishwoman recounts her bohemian childhood in a 15th-century
castle in Tuscany, and tells how World War II altered the region
and its inhabitants. Last year the reviewer Philip Gambone admired
Beevor's ability to make ``the irrepressible Tuscan spirit ... come
to life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARADISO  &LR; By Jose Lezama Lima. Dalkey Archive, $14.50. This
ambitious novel by a major Cuban poet concerns a boy's coming of
age and the wisdom he gains while searching for his dead father.
``Lezama not only has the power to create absorbing and memorable
images, he has also placed these images into a vast network of
philosophical and mythical significance,'' Edmund White wrote in
1974.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending April 1, at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

changes in book buying.

   KIDS-PSYCHODRUGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Are toddlers being plied
with Prozac, Ritalin and other powerful drugs for minor behavioral
problems? A recent study that documented an acute increase in the
prescription of psychiatric medications for preschoolers would
suggest that. Some mental health professionals have painted young
children as the latest victims of a culture obsessed with syndromes
and disorders. And politicians have seized the opportunity to
condemn the ``overmedicating'' of the nation's youngest citizens.

<P>
   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST-REVIEW (Undated) _ Since 1995, when the
government chronicle of Microsoft's predatory war on Internet
innovators begins, PCs have become less expensive and more
sophisticated. The industry has generated growth, jobs and wealth.
So why was this costly and sweeping antitrust suit filed against
Microsoft? To enforce the law and to support innovation. And the
latter reason marks what may be an important step in how government
and courts deal with the Internet economy in the future. By Steve
Lohr.

   CENSUS-APATHY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Does the American public's
growing lack of responsiveness to census questionnaires, which
parallels the falling rate of voting, represent a decline in a
sense of community or civic engagement? Is it a sign that Americans
have become more alienated from and less caring about each other?
Is it a fair measure of the a country turning inward? And to what

age, a factor? By Steven Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI-CUBANS-REVIEW (Miami) _ A look at the Cuban diaspora: this
city of exiles has never been known for restraint and moderation;
there are too many people drinking too much Cuban coffee, too many
conspiracies to untangle, too much frustration bottled up for too
many years. Ever since the Cuban exodus started 40 years ago, Miami
has been a place apart, a city floating in some sort of ether,
removed from the rest of the country. By Lizette Alvarez.

for a patent on the idea of deriving surnames from DNA. The
company's founder, Dr. Bryan Sykes, is a geneticist who has made an
intriguing discovery about English surnames: Many of them once had
a single bearer. Sykes, who analyzes DNA to track ancient

more and more money has been borrowed to buy shares. Margin debt is

   UGANDA-IMAGE-REVIEW (Nairobi, Kenya) _ Uganda has been groping
for explanations for the mass killings, and alongside
sensationalism in the press there has been a remarkably frank
discussion of the roots of the problem and a tracing of the current
religiosity and mysticism associated with cults to the despair left
by years of dictatorship, poverty, AIDS and other diseases. The
press discussion reveals much about how far Uganda has come in its
four tortured decades of independence, through a brutal
dictatorship and at last toward a society where open expression is
recognized as a tool for solving the nation's problems. By Ian
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-POLITICS-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ For all the attention
surrounding the stroke that toppled Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi,
the change at the nominal helm of the country has little real
import. The Japanese people have long been aware of a reality that
the rest of the world has yet to realize: Political leadership has
always been more irrelevant in Japan than in other countries. By

   BRITAIN-FRANCE-REVIEW (Paris) _ On both sides of the English
Channel, the treachery made the front pages. After she was chosen
as the model for the bust of Marianne, France's curvaceous national
symbol, Laetitia Casta rhapsodized about the benefits of living in
London. The young supermodel spoke of a diverse, lively city. But
everyone else suspected tax benefits, setting off a political
fistfight among French politicians and a cross-channel flow of
snide remarks that are so often the stuff of French-British
relations. By Suzanne Daley.

ZUT ALORS! A NATIONAL TREASURE FLIRTS WITH HERESY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ On both sides of the English channel the treachery made
the front pages.
</P>
<P>
   Barely six months after she was chosen as the model for the bust
of Marianne, France's curvaceous national symbol, Laetitia Casta
was rhapsodizing about the benefits of living in London.
</P>
<P>
   The young supermodel talked of a diverse, lively city. But
everyone else suspected tax benefits, setting off a political
fistfight among French politicians and a cross-channel flow of
snide remarks that are so often the stuff of French-British
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The British press made sure to mention that Casta was only one
of 150,000 French citizens who had moved to Britain since 1995 _
presumably lured by less red tape and a tax rate that at 37.6
percent is the lowest in the European Union after Spain and
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The French, however, let it be known that the London subway was
crowded and dirty, apartment rents were high, and should the
21-year-old Casta fall ill, British hospitals would not be nearly
as fine as the French ones.
</P>
<P>
   The French newspaper Le Monde wondered why _ apart from money _
any sensible French person would ever move to England. The health
system is a disaster, the trains are barely any better, the unions
cannot protect their workers, and the poor are paid peanuts.
England is an exquisite paradise indeed, huffed the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could one doubt the fury of the Association of French
Mayors, which choose Casta to be Marianne, facing down a barrage of
criticism that the mostly male group was simply running a beauty
contest. Some critics had suggested that a more accomplished woman
should be chosen to represent the modern Marianne, a figure that
emerged from the French Revolution to symbolize the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Marianne _ a kind of Uncle Sam figure _ has
evolved from a 1794 version in which she is helmeted like a Greek
goddess to the flag-waving, rifle-toting revolutionary of 1830
depicted in Delacroix's ``Liberty Leading the People,'' to busts
modeled on Catherine Deneuve and Brigitte Bardot.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, Casta appeared at the unveiling of the bust
based on her pouty good looks. But the news of her flirtation with
London had some French mayors swearing that her statue would never
appear in their city halls.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Delevoye, the president of the 36,000-member mayors'
association, lashed out at her defection. ``All we can say is that
we hope everyone who has been formed in France, supported by
France, educated in France, will also decide to pay their taxes in
France,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With tax reform an issue before Parliament now, Casta's rented
apartment near Covent Gardens offered a soap box opposition
politicians could not resist. ``This symbolizes magnificently the
failure of socialism, which succeeds in chasing away all talented
people,'' proclaimed Patrick Devedjian, the spokesman for France's
Rally for the Republic party. ``The tax burden in France is
suffocating.''
</P>
<P>
   After several days of silence, Casta on Tuesday denied that she
was making London her primary residence, though tax experts
estimated that she could cut her tax bill by 30 percent to 40
percent by doing so. France taxes models much more than other
countries because they are classified as salaried employees of
modeling agencies rather than freelancers.
</P>
<P>
   Her agent issued a statement saying: ``In reply to the false
information that has appeared in certain European media this
weekend, we are keen to re-establish the truth over a certain
number of errors.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement added that Casta ``does not plan to buy an
apartment in London'' and ``has not decided to settle there for tax
reasons.''

fistfight among French politicians and a cross-channel flow of
snide remarks that are so often the stuff of French-British
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The British press made sure to mention that Casta was only one
of 150,000 French citizens who had moved to Britain since 1995 _
presumably lured by less red tape and a tax rate that at 37.6
percent is the lowest in the European Union after Spain and
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The French, however, let it be known that the London subway was
crowded and dirty, apartment rents were high, and should the
21-year-old Casta fall ill, British hospitals would not be nearly
as fine as the French ones.
</P>
<P>
   The French newspaper Le Monde wondered why _ apart from money _
any sensible French person would ever move to England. The health
system is a disaster, the trains are barely any better, the unions
cannot protect their workers, and the poor are paid peanuts.
England is an exquisite paradise indeed, huffed the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could one doubt the fury of the Association of French
Mayors, which choose Casta to be Marianne, facing down a barrage of
criticism that the mostly male group was simply running a beauty
contest. Some critics had suggested that a more accomplished woman
should be chosen to represent the modern Marianne, a figure that
emerged from the French Revolution to symbolize the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Marianne _ a kind of Uncle Sam figure _ has
evolved from a 1794 version in which she is helmeted like a Greek
goddess to the flag-waving, rifle-toting revolutionary of 1830
depicted in Delacroix's ``Liberty Leading the People,'' to busts
modeled on Catherine Deneuve and Brigitte Bardot.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, Casta appeared at the unveiling of the bust
based on her pouty good looks. But the news of her flirtation with
London had some French mayors swearing that her statue would never
appear in their city halls.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Delevoye, the president of the 36,000-member mayors'
association, lashed out at her defection. ``All we can say is that
we hope everyone who has been formed in France, supported by
France, educated in France, will also decide to pay their taxes in
France,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With tax reform an issue before Parliament now, Casta's rented
apartment near Covent Gardens offered a soap box opposition
politicians could not resist. ``This symbolizes magnificently the
failure of socialism, which succeeds in chasing away all talented
people,'' proclaimed Patrick Devedjian, the spokesman for France's
Rally for the Republic party. ``The tax burden in France is
suffocating.''
</P>
<P>
   After several days of silence, Casta on Tuesday denied that she
was making London her primary residence, though tax experts
estimated that she could cut her tax bill by 30 percent to 40
percent by doing so. France taxes models much more than other
countries because they are classified as salaried employees of
modeling agencies rather than freelancers.
</P>
<P>
   Her agent issued a statement saying: ``In reply to the false
information that has appeared in certain European media this
weekend, we are keen to re-establish the truth over a certain
number of errors.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement added that Casta ``does not plan to buy an
apartment in London'' and ``has not decided to settle there for tax
reasons.''

JAPAN: WHERE ALL (AND NONE) LEAD

   TOKYO _ For all the attention that has surrounded the stroke
that toppled Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi from power, the change at
the nominal helm of the country with the world's second-largest
economy has little real import.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese people have long been aware of that. ``Whoever
becomes prime minister, it doesn't change anything,'' said Junko
Ota, a 39-year-old housewife shopping in Ginza the other day.
``That's what's sad about Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Her observation contains a truth that the rest of the world has
yet to acknowledge about Japan, despite the efforts of many
scholars and observers to explain it: political leadership in Japan
has always been more irrelevant than in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been suffering from the fact that there is no one
ultimately responsible to the people at large and to foreign
governments and leaders and international organizations,'' said
Hidekazu Kawai, a professor at Gakushuin University. ``The nominal
leader is not always the strongest man, and no one man is strong
enough to dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, how poorly the economy has been managed in
the last decade. The buck does not stop at the prime minister's
desk, nor on any one person's desk. Decisions are made by a
consortium of business associations, government bureaucracies and
groups of politicians. No individual can be held responsible nor
can any one take credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders do not matter in modern Japan, where situations are
managed collectively, not by an individual,'' said William R.
Farrell, head of a business consultancy, Dynamic Strategies Asia.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many political figures wield power in Japan, like
former Prime Ministers Kiichi Miyazawa, Yasuhiro Nakasone and even
Noboru Takeshita, who has been bed-ridden with undisclosed medical
problems for almost a year. Obuchi, as head of the largest faction
in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, was powerful. And Hiromu
Nonaka, now No. 2 in the new government, is considered by many to
be Japan's most powerful man.
</P>
<P>
   But in the West, that very phrase _ ``Japan's most powerful
man'' _ more often clouds an understanding of Japan's power
structure than clarifies it. None of these men has the power to
make decisions or prescribe policy on his own, and as Japan is
increasingly forced to stitch itself into the global economy, that
is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``A state, whatever definition you use, has a core to its
identity,'' said Karel Van Wolferen, author of ``The Enigma of
Japanese Power,'' perhaps the seminal book on the Japanese power
structure. ``Here you have federations of bureaucratic bodies, both
business and government, determining policy, and groups of
politicians play a role in that. But there is no such thing as a
center of political accountability.``
</P>
<P>
   So the question arises: who is the opposite number to the U.S.
president or the British prime minister? To whom should concerns
and requests be addressed? From whom can commitments be extracted?
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties manifest themselves in several ways. Most
recently, the United States and Japan have squared off over the
deregulation of Japan's telecommunications market. No one denies
that in 1998 Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto promised President
Clinton that Japan would dramatically lower the fees the former
government telephone monopoly charges competitors for connecting
their customers to its customers. But the government has simply
ignored the promise, illustrating how little power a prime minister
really has here.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a home health care program for the elderly that was
one of Obuchi's biggest accomplishments was watered down by
Parliament at the demand of a group of politicians led by Shizuka
Kamei, who heads the second-largest faction within the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
   The fragmented nature of the ruling party, which is really a
confederation of five or more factions, is partly responsible for
the prime minister's weakness. Unlike the British prime minister,
the Japanese prime minister must horse trade to win as much support
from various factions as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Yoshiro Mori, the new prime minister, was chosen by party
elders who valued his good relationship with the ruling party's
coalition partner, the Komei Party, rather than his leadership
skills or vision.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister ``is not strong enough to control the whole
party,'' said Takeshi Sasaki, a political science professor at
Tokyo University. ``He controls the party in cooperation with the
leaders of the factions and the party elders, but not on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Many suggest that a colorless figurehead is all the Japanese
people want, and that a real leader would mesh poorly with the
country's desire for stability and harmony.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of laws were adopted last year with the intention
of giving more power to the prime minister and his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   One was a freedom of information law that, although weak by U.S.
standards, greatly enhances transparency here.
</P>
<P>
   The public has also been treated to a somewhat stiff version of
prime minister's question time, during which for the first time
cabinet officials have been forced to stand up in Parliament and
submit to questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of things tend to keep people focused on the prime
minister as the person in charge, the person who's responsible, and
that's a big change,'' Kawai said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, people who live in Tokyo have begun confessing a
liking for Shintaro Ishihara, the capital's governor, who has
implemented several policies to improve the city's badly ailing
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Abrasive, outspoken and opinionated, Ishihara is precisely the
kind of politician urbanized Japanese voters have long shunned. Yet
last week, several people wished aloud that someone like him were
on hand to replace Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Yoichi Masozue, a political commentator who ran against Ishihara
in the gubernatorial election, suggests one reason for his rival's
popularity: ``The governors of the prefectures, like Ishihara, are
directly elected by the people. They thus enjoy a more powerful
leadership and legitimacy that way, and in a time of globalization,
we need strong leaders with quick responses.''

LITTLE HAVANA: CUBA'S EXILES FROM BOTH SIDES OF A GREAT DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ This city of Cuban exiles has never been known for
restraint and moderation; there are too many people drinking too
much Cuban coffee, too many conspiracies to untangle, too much
frustration bottled up for too many years.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Cuban exodus started 40 years ago, Miami has been
a place apart, a city floating in some sort of ether, removed from
the rest of the country. Where else do people trade rumors of Fidel
Castro's impending death _ ``Did you notice how gaunt he looks? Did
you hear he had a stroke?'' _ the way others swap stock tips? Where
else are 4-year-olds spooked not by the bogyman in the closet but
by a bearded giant in olive green fatigues living across the
Florida Straits?
</P>
<P>
   I knew all of this long before I set foot outside the house of
Elian Gonzalez's great-uncle in Little Havana, a notebook in my
back pocket, a couple of weeks ago. I was born here, to
credentialed anti-communist parents; my father was a pilot who flew
missions into the Congo for the CIA to root out leftist insurgents
in the '60s; my mother has not set foot back on Cuban soil since
1961, when she and my siblings left Havana. She won't go back, not
while the ``devil'' remains alive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even I was unprepared for the fervor outside of Lazaro
Gonzalez's home, four months after little Elian was picked up at
sea. Maybe I had been gone too long. You grow up, you leave Miami
and you begin to see that things are not always so black and white.
That in places like Iowa, people can go years without even thinking
about Cuba, unless they like cigars. Or that they can question the
wisdom of the United States trying to overthrow Fidel Castro, even
though they share the Cuban exiles' contempt for him.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly midnight when I arrived in Little Havana, and the
block of modest, concrete houses, awash in television lights, was
teeming with people standing behind the barricades that separate
the crowd from the house. People waved signs with Elian's picture.
They likened him to baby Jesus. One man chanted the rosary into a
megaphone, leading a small group in prayer. Several women stood on
the front lines, waiting to steal a glance of the little boy behind
the glass.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was edgy, suspicious. The word was that a federal SWAT
team was ready to swoop in and steal Elian away, and that his Cuban
exile ``protectors'' were girding for confrontation. So when a
group of college students showed up to snap photographs and shout
down the demonstrators, the crowd went berserk, and somehow I (my
press pass buried deep inside my purse) got pegged as one of the
provocateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comunista,'' they shouted, spit flying, fingers jabbing at my
face. The group started looking more like a mob, and for a minute,
I thought about calling over one of the cops, who was attending to
the college students. ``There is another one here,'' one woman
yelled, motioning the rest of the crowd over my way. Spying my
close-cropped hair, another woman shouted, ``lesbian.''
</P>
<P>
   I found myself cringing, not out of fear but out of exasperation
and embarrassment _ for them, not myself. After I finally dug out
my press pass and got down to the business of interviewing people,
I couldn't help but think, ``Is it any wonder the rest of America
thinks that Cubans in Miami are zealots?''
</P>
<P>
   As an outsider, who is also an insider, I could understand why
they would think so. Most Americans, polls show, think that Elian
belongs with his father _ that blood is thicker than Marxism. Most
Americans also seem to think that Cubans in Miami, who are not
known for their tolerance, have received enough largesse. Haven't
they reshaped Miami in their own image?
</P>
<P>
   But most Americans, I know from my own experience, do not
understand that Cuban exiles see the world through a different
prism. Here the cold war is not a distant memory and Elian is not
just a little boy. He is the embodiment of 40 interminable years of
rancor and bitterness toward Fidel Castro _ and toward the U.S.
government, for failing to depose him or take a harder line.
</P>
<P>
   Here, even the terminology is different. Cubans are exiles,
refugees who were forced to choose between country and liberty, not
immigrants seeking the proverbial pot of gold.
</P>
<P>
   You grow up hearing angry words from people who think the United
States never did enough to free Cuba from Castro. The Bay of Pigs
fiasco, something most Americans don't even remember until that
Kennedy documentary runs on the History Channel, is talked about
all the time. Some of my friends' fathers took part in it. People
are still waiting for someone to do something. A small group of
exiles, many of them aged now, haven't given up plotting and
preparing. They plop onto their stomachs in the tall grass near the
Everglades, their rifles at the ready, practicing for that fateful
day.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Havana, no one has forgotten that a Cuban MiG shot
down two Cuban exile planes just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-MIAMI-CUBANS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; MIAMI: years ago. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here, politicians are judged first and foremost by how much they
despise Fidel and communism, not by where they stand on education
and Social Security. You grow up meeting former political prisoners
who spent 15 years in Cuban jails for showing their disillusionment
with the revolution, and thousands of others who broke Cuban law
and jumped on teeny, tottering rafts just to get away. You know
lots of cousins here who hate cousins there because they are
communist believers, and you hear endless sorrowful tales from
mothers who can't get their children out of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   You swim in nostalgia here, some of it air-brushed by time. As
kids, we would laugh at our parents' descriptions of Cuba, where
the sand on the beaches was as fine and as white as sugar and where
everyone lived in perfect harmony.
</P>
<P>
   To them, Fidel Castro is not an irrelevant dictator. He is not a
curious relic.
</P>
<P>
   Now I find that in Elian, exiles are venting about all this and
more: about how they placed their hope in a young, bearded
revolutionary who later betrayed them without a hint of remorse;
how they lost their homes, crammed with photographs accumulated
through generations; how they said goodbye to family members they
expected to see again soon, in a matter of months, maybe a few
years; and in the end, how they lost their country, the place where
they expected to marry, have children, grow old and die.
</P>
<P>
   But now I am also an outsider looking in, and it is easy to see
why Cuban exiles have drawn the ire of many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Their television screen has shown them people in Miami who want
to reshape the law to fit their endgame. It has shown them a mayor
who has said his police officers will not cooperate with the
federal government. It has shown people who are protesting in the
name of freedom chasing away other people who are also protesting
in the name of freedom. And, for the xenophobes, it has shown them
people unfurling Cuban flags, speaking staccato Spanish and pining
for the old country while casting aspersions on the new.
</P>
<P>
   For some outside Miami, it is difficult to understand why people
who have heaped scorn on Castro for so long for wrenching families
apart appear to be doing that very thing.
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami, it makes perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, exiles have felt helpless. Then came Elian.

though they share the Cuban exiles' contempt for him.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly midnight when I arrived in Little Havana, and the
block of modest, concrete houses, awash in television lights, was
teeming with people standing behind the barricades that separate
the crowd from the house. People waved signs with Elian's picture.
They likened him to baby Jesus. One man chanted the rosary into a
megaphone, leading a small group in prayer. Several women stood on
the front lines, waiting to steal a glance of the little boy behind
the glass.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was edgy, suspicious. The word was that a federal SWAT
team was ready to swoop in and steal Elian away, and that his Cuban
exile ``protectors'' were girding for confrontation. So when a
group of college students showed up to snap photographs and shout
down the demonstrators, the crowd went berserk, and somehow I (my
press pass buried deep inside my purse) got pegged as one of the
provocateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comunista,'' they shouted, spit flying, fingers jabbing at my
face. The group started looking more like a mob, and for a minute,
I thought about calling over one of the cops, who was attending to
the college students. ``There is another one here,'' one woman
yelled, motioning the rest of the crowd over my way. Spying my
close-cropped hair, another woman shouted, ``lesbian.''
</P>
<P>
   I found myself cringing, not out of fear but out of exasperation
and embarrassment _ for them, not myself. After I finally dug out
my press pass and got down to the business of interviewing people,
I couldn't help but think, ``Is it any wonder the rest of America
thinks that Cubans in Miami are zealots?''
</P>
<P>
   As an outsider, who is also an insider, I could understand why
they would think so. Most Americans, polls show, think that Elian
belongs with his father _ that blood is thicker than Marxism. Most
Americans also seem to think that Cubans in Miami, who are not
known for their tolerance, have received enough largesse. Haven't
they reshaped Miami in their own image?
</P>
<P>
   But most Americans, I know from my own experience, do not
understand that Cuban exiles see the world through a different
prism. Here the cold war is not a distant memory and Elian is not
just a little boy. He is the embodiment of 40 interminable years of
rancor and bitterness toward Fidel Castro _ and toward the U.S.
government, for failing to depose him or take a harder line.
</P>
<P>
   Here, even the terminology is different. Cubans are exiles,
refugees who were forced to choose between country and liberty, not
immigrants seeking the proverbial pot of gold.
</P>
<P>
   You grow up hearing angry words from people who think the United
States never did enough to free Cuba from Castro. The Bay of Pigs
fiasco, something most Americans don't even remember until that
Kennedy documentary runs on the History Channel, is talked about
all the time. Some of my friends' fathers took part in it. People
are still waiting for someone to do something. A small group of
exiles, many of them aged now, haven't given up plotting and
preparing. They plop onto their stomachs in the tall grass near the
Everglades, their rifles at the ready, practicing for that fateful
day.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Havana, no one has forgotten that a Cuban MiG shot
down two Cuban exile planes just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-MIAMI-CUBANS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; MIAMI: years ago. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here, politicians are judged first and foremost by how much they
despise Fidel and communism, not by where they stand on education
and Social Security. You grow up meeting former political prisoners
who spent 15 years in Cuban jails for showing their disillusionment
with the revolution, and thousands of others who broke Cuban law
and jumped on teeny, tottering rafts just to get away. You know
lots of cousins here who hate cousins there because they are
communist believers, and you hear endless sorrowful tales from
mothers who can't get their children out of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   You swim in nostalgia here, some of it air-brushed by time. As
kids, we would laugh at our parents' descriptions of Cuba, where
the sand on the beaches was as fine and as white as sugar and where
everyone lived in perfect harmony.
</P>
<P>
   To them, Fidel Castro is not an irrelevant dictator. He is not a
curious relic.
</P>
<P>
   Now I find that in Elian, exiles are venting about all this and
more: about how they placed their hope in a young, bearded
revolutionary who later betrayed them without a hint of remorse;
how they lost their homes, crammed with photographs accumulated
through generations; how they said goodbye to family members they
expected to see again soon, in a matter of months, maybe a few
years; and in the end, how they lost their country, the place where
they expected to marry, have children, grow old and die.
</P>
<P>
   But now I am also an outsider looking in, and it is easy to see
why Cuban exiles have drawn the ire of many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Their television screen has shown them people in Miami who want
to reshape the law to fit their endgame. It has shown them a mayor
who has said his police officers will not cooperate with the
federal government. It has shown people who are protesting in the
name of freedom chasing away other people who are also protesting
in the name of freedom. And, for the xenophobes, it has shown them
people unfurling Cuban flags, speaking staccato Spanish and pining
for the old country while casting aspersions on the new.
</P>
<P>
   For some outside Miami, it is difficult to understand why people
who have heaped scorn on Castro for so long for wrenching families
apart appear to be doing that very thing.
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami, it makes perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, exiles have felt helpless. Then came Elian.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Census 2000 not that nosy, just lazy
 &HT;    For release April 12, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG

<P>
   It has become commonplace to gripe about the census. Invasion of
privacy is the most used depiction. Actually, the census doesn't
ask you much that it doesn't already know.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been coping with one of two forms of Census 2000
response: the short form which basically asks you little else other
than your name, rank and serial number and the longer form, which
asks you a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   One of six American homes were sent the long form, mine being
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   It went on page after page, asking questions that I thought it
already had the answers to. Some friends who also got the long form
are clearly displeased by the tenor of the questions. I feel more
amused than abused.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I didn't find it that intrusive. Is there anything more
probing than your income tax form? By the end of the weekend, most
of us will have reported to Internal Revenue every dime we made
last year, how much we paid for our medical expenses, what we spent
on charity, who fed off us as dependents and everything about our
businesses as regards to expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Census 2000 form didn't ask much more. I was, however,
perturbed by one question. I didn't mind when it asked how much I
earned in salary, or how much I received in interest or dividends,
even how much I might have gotten in Social Security benefits. IRS
already has that information. In fact, I had to refer to my tax
form to get the information for my census form.
</P>
<P>
   What irked me, however, was when Census 2000 asked me to add it
all up. One would think that with all those computers and abacuses
at the disposal of the federal government, they could do their own
addition.
</P>
<P>
   My accountant had to do something similar for my tax form, but
by the time he finished inserting the deductions, applying the
doodads, separating gross from net, I never could get a clear
understanding. I just signed where he told me to sign and mailed it
off to the feds.
</P>
<P>
   Now Census 2000 wants me to do their addition for them. After
much contemplation, I did it but I wonder what would have happened
had I not. Would some government official come knocking on my door
demanding I add things up? What would have happened had I told him
to go over to the IRS office and ask them?
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this was a minor detail and I complied.
</P>
<P>
   Another question that somewhat buffaloed me was about my
heritage. Census 2000 wants to know if we're Greek or African,
Italian or Chinese, Latin American or German. Many of us don't
know.
</P>
<P>
   I found the question difficult to answer inasmuch as my people
have been wandering for thousands of years, chased from here to
there and back again -- likely intermarried or transmutes by
conquering armies of rapists. (The latter might explain why a
doctor once informed me a condition on my hand is inherent to those
with Viking blood running through their veins.)
</P>
<P>
   Inasmuch as my discernible heritage wasn't listed, I opted for
the bottom line that was identified as ``other.'' My first thought
was to put down the Land of Canaan as the origin of my forbearers
but some dude at Census 2000 might misconstrue my family's roots to
be in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Shall I put down Russia, or shall it be Poland; perhaps Ukraine,
maybe Lithuania? It's all a hodgepodge; grandma was from there,
grandpa from somewhere else -- always moving around, at the
direction of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   I finally settled on ``Eastern European.'' Let Census 2000
figure it out from there. After all, I did their mathematics for
them, they can do the geography.

NEWS OF THE WEEK IN REVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Discrimination Is Painful. It Can Also Be Agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   A study titled ``We Don't Carry That'' suggests that people who
need medication for severe pain may have trouble getting it if they
live in neighborhoods that are mostly black, Hispanic or Asian.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 347 pharmacies in New York City, conducted by the
Mount Sinai School of Medicine, found that in nonwhite
neighborhoods only 25 percent of pharmacies carried enough morphine
or morphine-like drugs to treat severe pain; in white
neighborhoods, 72 percent did. Interviews with doctors and
pharmacists in Los Angeles and the Midwest suggested similar
problems there.
</P>
<P>
   Half the druggists blamed low demand, saying they could not
afford to stock items that customers did not buy. Some also cited
onerous narcotics laws and fear of theft in high-crime
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some pharmacies who are very anxious about armed
robberies and will have signs saying that they don't carry
narcotics,'' one pharmacist said.
</P>
<P>
   If demand is truly lower, no one knows why. Minorities are no
less likely than whites to suffer from illnesses that cause great
pain. Blacks, in fact, have higher cancer rates than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Some pharmacists suggested that demand was lower in poor
neighborhoods because they had higher proportions of uninsured
people who could not afford to fill prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors who reviewed the survey said racial bias might be at
work because the results fit into a wider pattern of inequality in
health care, revealed by recent studies showing that blacks are
less likely than whites to be referred for kidney transplants or
surgery for early-stage cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study comes on the heels of many other studies that have
documented a disparity in treatment in which racial and ethnic
factors seem to be the predominant factor,'' said Dr. Richard
Payne, chief of the pain and palliative care service at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ``And that's quite disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, doctors are less likely to prescribe painkillers
for blacks and Hispanics with broken bones or postoperative pain,
perhaps because of the false perception that they are more likely
to be addicts or less likely to need treatment for pain.

   Forget robins, equinoxes and daylight saving time: spring has
begun. On Monday, after a peculiar road trip, during which several
teams played their first league games in Japan, baseball really got
under way again.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees' pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre has seen
more than three decades of opening days, but he awoke on Monday
thinking baseball. ``I found myself craving it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre wasn't alone. As the Yankees waited to play their
West Coast opener against the Anaheim Angels, about a dozen players
gathered in the clubhouse more than three hours before their own
game, to watch televised highlights from other games that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' Andres Galarraga, who sat out last year with cancer,
bashed a home run in Atlanta and the Yankees cheered. Vladimir
Guerrero, of the Montreal Expos, hit two home runs, the second a
mammoth shot that awed the Yankee couch potatoes. And when Derek
Bell, the Mets' new outfielder, hit a pivotal home run in Shea
Stadium, the Yankees grunted as one, urging him on as he swung.

   The Last of the Clinton Five Is Cleared of Wrongdoing
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, the fifth cabinet officer in the
Clinton administration to be investigated by an independent
counsel, was cleared of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   After a 23-month investigation, the prosecutor, Ralph I.
Lancaster Jr., said there was no reason to seek an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The scorecard on the Clinton five: Herman and Bruce Babbitt, the
interior secretary, were cleared by independent counsels; former
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor
count, and Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was acquitted of all
charges at trial. An investigation of Commerce Secretary Ronald
Brown ended after he was killed in a plane crash.

   Microsoft's leaders talk tough to the press, saying the
government's antitrust charges are wrong. But they sing a different
tune to their brokers.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found
Microsoft in violation of the nation's antitrust laws, several of
the company's leaders, including chairman Bill Gates, exercised
options to sell company stock worth tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good bet. On the day of the ruling, Microsoft's stock
lost almost 14 percent of its value.

   NATO Finally Catches One
</P>
<P>
   The accused war criminal Momcilo Krajisnik was arrested at his
parents' Bosnian home by French NATO troops and flown to the
international tribunal in The Hague, where he pleaded not guilty to
war crimes for his role in Serbia's ethnic cleansing campaign in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik, a close ally of the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic, is considered the most important war crimes suspect yet
captured by NATO, which has been criticized for not pursuing more
aggressively those responsible for the atrocities committed in the
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
said of Krajisnik's capture, ``This is possibly the most important
day since the Dayton agreement on Bosnia,'' which ended the war in
1995. Krajisnik, 55, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Incredible Is Testable, But in Another Dimension
</P>
<P>
   Superstring theorists have a problem: You can't test a theory
that posits that all matter consists of ``notes'' produced by tiny
strings vibrating in nine-dimensional space. We aware of only three
dimensions because the rest are curled up into extremely tiny
balls, a hundred million trillion times smaller than a proton.
</P>
<P>
   But Lisa Randall of Princeton University, Raman Sundrum of
Stanford University and Joseph Lykken of the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory have proposed that at least one of the extra
dimensions is actually a four-dimensional megaverse inside which
the universe floats like a bubble. They believe that energy might
occasionally leak into the fourth dimension _ and that idea might
be testable.
</P>
<P>
   When two particles are slammed together in an accelerator, the
amount of energy going into the reaction should equal the amount
coming out.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't, energy could be leaking into the fourth
dimension. Scientists are searching records of past accelerator
experiments for signs of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a discovery of extra dimensions is already sitting on a
tape in some data bank,'' Lykken said.

   A Friend of Ours Writes
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker magazine was renowned for attempting to verify
every fact it published. In a recent book on the magazine, however,
onetime staff writer Renata Adler announced without proof that the
late Judge John Sirica was ``corrupt,'' ``dishonest'' and had
``clear ties to organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirica, who presided over the Watergate burglary trial, which
ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in
1974, was widely regarded as a scrupulously honest jurist.
</P>
<P>
   Adler told a New York Times reporter that she would publish
proof of her charge when she pleased. Meanwhile, John Dean, former
Nixon counsel, suggested Adler might have been misled by G. Gordon
Liddy, whom Sirica sentenced to prison for his role in Watergate.

   Border guards in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan seized
a radioactive cargo on an Iranian truck bound for Pakistan, said
State Department officials. The material, found in 10 lead
containers about the size of a thick briefcase, was being tested by
officials in neighboring Kazakhstan, where it originated, to see if
it could have been used to make a nuclear weapon. Pakistan has a
history of smuggling nuclear components, and is believed to have
built about a dozen warheads.

   No one should be forced to be a parent, according to a ruling by
the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court concerning the fate of
frozen embryos created by a couple with fertility problems. After
the couple divorced, the 44-year-old former wife wanted to use the
embryos for one last try at getting pregnant, but the ex-husband
objected, though he had earlier signed consent forms saying she
could have the embryos.
</P>
<P>
   In the third such dispute over embryos to reach a state supreme
court _ and likely not the last, given the estimated 150,000 frozen
embryos nationwide _ the Massachusetts court said that, despite the
contract, it would be bad public policy to coerce parenthood.

   The Coup That Fell to Earth
</P>
<P>
   Nawaz Sharif, ousted by a military coup last October from his
position as Pakistan's prime minister, was convicted of hijacking a
commercial airliner. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and
ordered to forfeit all his personal property. Six co-defendants
were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's hijacking was a peculiar one in that he didn't take
over an airplane. Rather, he ordered that a Karachi-bound plane be
refused permission to land, even though it was running low on fuel.
The plane carried 198 passengers, including Gen. Pervez Musharraf,
who would depose Sharif later in the same day.

   The U.S. Army, already battered in recent years by sexual
misconduct scandals, was jolted again with the disclosure that a
general accused of sexual harassment by the Army's highest-ranking
woman was appointed last August to be the service's deputy
inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of the officer, Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith,
prompted Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, the Army's first woman to earn
three stars, to lodge a formal complaint against him.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said she was concerned that he would be responsible
for investigating accusations of wrongdoing, including sexual
harassment.

   Discrimination Is Painful. It Can Also Be Agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   A study titled ``We Don't Carry That'' suggests that people who
need medication for severe pain may have trouble getting it if they
live in neighborhoods that are mostly black, Hispanic or Asian.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 347 pharmacies in New York City, conducted by the
Mount Sinai School of Medicine, found that in nonwhite
neighborhoods only 25 percent of pharmacies carried enough morphine
or morphine-like drugs to treat severe pain; in white
neighborhoods, 72 percent did. Interviews with doctors and
pharmacists in Los Angeles and the Midwest suggested similar
problems there.
</P>
<P>
   Half the druggists blamed low demand, saying they could not
afford to stock items that customers did not buy. Some also cited
onerous narcotics laws and fear of theft in high-crime
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some pharmacies who are very anxious about armed
robberies and will have signs saying that they don't carry
narcotics,'' one pharmacist said.
</P>
<P>
   If demand is truly lower, no one knows why. Minorities are no
less likely than whites to suffer from illnesses that cause great
pain. Blacks, in fact, have higher cancer rates than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Some pharmacists suggested that demand was lower in poor
neighborhoods because they had higher proportions of uninsured
people who could not afford to fill prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors who reviewed the survey said racial bias might be at
work because the results fit into a wider pattern of inequality in
health care, revealed by recent studies showing that blacks are
less likely than whites to be referred for kidney transplants or
surgery for early-stage cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study comes on the heels of many other studies that have
documented a disparity in treatment in which racial and ethnic
factors seem to be the predominant factor,'' said Dr. Richard
Payne, chief of the pain and palliative care service at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ``And that's quite disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, doctors are less likely to prescribe painkillers
for blacks and Hispanics with broken bones or postoperative pain,
perhaps because of the false perception that they are more likely
to be addicts or less likely to need treatment for pain.

   Play Ball!
</P>
<P>
   Forget robins, equinoxes and daylight saving time: spring has
begun. On Monday, after a peculiar road trip, during which several
teams played their first league games in Japan, baseball really got
under way again.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees' pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre has seen
more than three decades of opening days, but he awoke on Monday
thinking baseball. ``I found myself craving it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre wasn't alone. As the Yankees waited to play their
West Coast opener against the Anaheim Angels, about a dozen players
gathered in the clubhouse more than three hours before their own
game, to watch televised highlights from other games that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' Andres Galarraga, who sat out last year with cancer,
bashed a home run in Atlanta and the Yankees cheered. Vladimir
Guerrero, of the Montreal Expos, hit two home runs, the second a
mammoth shot that awed the Yankee couch potatoes. And when Derek
Bell, the Mets' new outfielder, hit a pivotal home run in Shea
Stadium, the Yankees grunted as one, urging him on as he swung.

   The Last of the Clinton Five Is Cleared of Wrongdoing
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, the fifth cabinet officer in the
Clinton administration to be investigated by an independent
counsel, was cleared of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   After a 23-month investigation, the prosecutor, Ralph I.
Lancaster Jr., said there was no reason to seek an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The scorecard on the Clinton five: Herman and Bruce Babbitt, the
interior secretary, were cleared by independent counsels; former
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor
count, and Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was acquitted of all
charges at trial. An investigation of Commerce Secretary Ronald
Brown ended after he was killed in a plane crash.

<P>
   Microsoft's leaders talk tough to the press, saying the
government's antitrust charges are wrong. But they sing a different
tune to their brokers.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found
Microsoft in violation of the nation's antitrust laws, several of
the company's leaders, including chairman Bill Gates, exercised
options to sell company stock worth tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good bet. On the day of the ruling, Microsoft's stock
lost almost 14 percent of its value.

   NATO Finally Catches One
</P>
<P>
   The accused war criminal Momcilo Krajisnik was arrested at his
parents' Bosnian home by French NATO troops and flown to the
international tribunal in The Hague, where he pleaded not guilty to
war crimes for his role in Serbia's ethnic cleansing campaign in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik, a close ally of the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic, is considered the most important war crimes suspect yet
captured by NATO, which has been criticized for not pursuing more
aggressively those responsible for the atrocities committed in the
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
said of Krajisnik's capture, ``This is possibly the most important
day since the Dayton agreement on Bosnia,'' which ended the war in
1995. Krajisnik, 55, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Incredible Is Testable, But in Another Dimension
</P>
<P>
   Superstring theorists have a problem: You can't test a theory
that posits that all matter consists of ``notes'' produced by tiny
strings vibrating in nine-dimensional space. We aware of only three
dimensions because the rest are curled up into extremely tiny
balls, a hundred million trillion times smaller than a proton.
</P>
<P>
   But Lisa Randall of Princeton University, Raman Sundrum of
Stanford University and Joseph Lykken of the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory have proposed that at least one of the extra
dimensions is actually a four-dimensional megaverse inside which
the universe floats like a bubble. They believe that energy might
occasionally leak into the fourth dimension _ and that idea might
be testable.
</P>
<P>
   When two particles are slammed together in an accelerator, the
amount of energy going into the reaction should equal the amount
coming out.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't, energy could be leaking into the fourth
dimension. Scientists are searching records of past accelerator
experiments for signs of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a discovery of extra dimensions is already sitting on a
tape in some data bank,'' Lykken said.

   A Friend of Ours Writes
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker magazine was renowned for attempting to verify
every fact it published. In a recent book on the magazine, however,
onetime staff writer Renata Adler announced without proof that the
late Judge John Sirica was ``corrupt,'' ``dishonest'' and had
``clear ties to organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirica, who presided over the Watergate burglary trial, which
ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in
1974, was widely regarded as a scrupulously honest jurist.
</P>
<P>
   Adler told a New York Times reporter that she would publish
proof of her charge when she pleased. Meanwhile, John Dean, former
Nixon counsel, suggested Adler might have been misled by G. Gordon
Liddy, whom Sirica sentenced to prison for his role in Watergate.

   Border guards in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan seized
a radioactive cargo on an Iranian truck bound for Pakistan, said
State Department officials. The material, found in 10 lead
containers about the size of a thick briefcase, was being tested by
officials in neighboring Kazakhstan, where it originated, to see if
it could have been used to make a nuclear weapon. Pakistan has a
history of smuggling nuclear components, and is believed to have
built about a dozen warheads.

   No one should be forced to be a parent, according to a ruling by
the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court concerning the fate of
frozen embryos created by a couple with fertility problems. After
the couple divorced, the 44-year-old former wife wanted to use the
embryos for one last try at getting pregnant, but the ex-husband
objected, though he had earlier signed consent forms saying she
could have the embryos.
</P>
<P>
   In the third such dispute over embryos to reach a state supreme
court _ and likely not the last, given the estimated 150,000 frozen
embryos nationwide _ the Massachusetts court said that, despite the
contract, it would be bad public policy to coerce parenthood.

   The Coup That Fell to Earth
</P>
<P>
   Nawaz Sharif, ousted by a military coup last October from his
position as Pakistan's prime minister, was convicted of hijacking a
commercial airliner. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and
ordered to forfeit all his personal property. Six co-defendants
were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's hijacking was a peculiar one in that he didn't take
over an airplane. Rather, he ordered that a Karachi-bound plane be
refused permission to land, even though it was running low on fuel.
The plane carried 198 passengers, including Gen. Pervez Musharraf,
who would depose Sharif later in the same day.

misconduct scandals, was jolted again with the disclosure that a
general accused of sexual harassment by the Army's highest-ranking
woman was appointed last August to be the service's deputy
inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of the officer, Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith,
prompted Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, the Army's first woman to earn
three stars, to lodge a formal complaint against him.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said she was concerned that he would be responsible
for investigating accusations of wrongdoing, including sexual
harassment.

POLICY REVIEW ON CUBA LIKELY, US OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once the shouting stops in the Elian Gonzalez case,
the larger issue of US-Cuba relations is headed for a broad
reexamination in the coming months, Clinton administration
officials and members of Congress say.
</P>
<P>
   The result could soon be a number of small but portentous new
changes in the prickly relationship, from new exemptions to the US
trade embargo and making it easier for Cuban-Americans to visit the
island, to a possible weakening of the political clout of exiles in
Florida and elsewhere who are opposed to Cuban President Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic and Republican members of Congress have
predicted a backlash against the Cuban-American protesters in Miami
for their vociferous demands that the boy stay in the United
States. National polls show 60 percent of Americans favor reuniting
the boy with his father, who now waits in a Cuban diplomat's home
in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   It is also significant, said three US officials in interviews
last week, that for the first time in recent memory US and Cuban
governments were publicly and prominently working together on the
same side of an issue _ reuniting father and son.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is likely to produce a dramatic change in the near
term, the US officials said, but it is expected to create a renewed
focus on US policy toward the island and could spur incremental
changes in the longstanding American trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will continue to look at constructive ways of
moving things ahead in small ways,'' said one US official, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``I don't expect anything dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has had a unilateral economic embargo against
Cuba for nearly four decades, sanctions that began with the premise
_ now largely discounted _ that Cuba was a threat to US security.
Four years ago, Clinton signed the Helms-Burton law, which further
tightened the terms of the embargo, giving Congress the power to
approve any major changes toward normalization with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to enact some small changes is either up for
consideration in Congress or is being prepared in congressional
offices. Among the possibilities in the next year: legislation that
would exempt food and medicine from the embargo and would allow
easier terms for exiles to visit family in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the two governments have cooperated in
smaller endeavors. The most promising one is the sharing of
information in antidrug operations. Officials also have worked
together on environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Many more Americans have begun touring Cuba in recent years as
travel restrictions have eased. The Clinton administration has also
allowed Cuban-Americans to send larger remittances to their
families back home and has opened the embargo slightly to permit
sales of certain agricultural and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But since Elian was found floating barely conscious on an inner
tube near Fort Lauderdale more than four months ago and the custody
issue became so contentious, officials in the White House and
National Security Council have carefully skirted issues having to
do with Cuba. One White House official said there has been no
e-mail traffic on Cuban issues over the last several months. That
is highly unusual, the official said, calling it an indicator of
the political sensitivity arising from the custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the battle over Cuba policy already is bubbling up, whether
senior US officials like it or not, and Cuban-Americans are girding
to defend the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite clear that the strategy of the left and other
sundry embargo haters on this issue is to exploit some of the
dynamics of this Elian issue to demonize the Cuban-American
community and, by extension, delegitimize US policy toward Cuba,''
said Jose R. Cardenas, Washington director of the Cuban American
National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if a hound has picked up the scent of the
fox,'' he continued. ``I have in mind someone like (US
Representative) Maxine Waters. They smell blood and they are
proceeding apace. I think it is a great miscalculation on their
part. I see a rejuvenated Cuban-American community that is going to
be even more vigilant to anybody attempting to exploit the Elian
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters, a California Democrat, could not be reached for comment,
but her spokesman, Frank Phillips said, ``Her main focus is
reuniting the son with his father. She's never been in favor of
politicizing this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters had previously called for closer US-Cuba relations. She
is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat and member of
the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview that a
reevaluation of relations with Cuba was ``way overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a frozen, stalemated, counterproductive policy that is
not in humanitarian interests nor in our larger credibility
interest in the region,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   While saying that US diplomats should not unilaterally remove
the sanctions, he said, ``There is just a complete and total
contradiction between the way we deal with China, the way we dealt
with Russia, the way we have been dealing with Cuba over the last
(several) years. It speaks volumes about the problems in the
current American electoral process. . . . The only reason we don't
reevaluate the policy is the politics of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida and New Jersey, Cuban-Americans form powerful voting
blocs, giving them key leverage in the presidential electoral
counts. Both major presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Governor George W. Bush, have sided with those who want
Elian to stay in the United States, saying they want a family court
to decide the issue, not the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican, said there was ``no
question that the mishandling of this case is going to have
consequences in the future regarding Cuban-American policy. Will it
change? Of course it's going to change. We have an irrelevant
anachronistic policy toward Cuba. Everyone is trading with Castro
and Cuba except the US.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel, who cosponsored legislation to exempt food and medicine
from the embargo, said the debate over Elian has ``brought some
transparency to the political hold that the anti-Castro
Cuban-Americans have held on Florida and New Jersey politics. It
holds the same hostage factor on American politics because of the
larger electoral votes in Florida and New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, government officials are less optimistic that the Elian
drama has created openings for Havana and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true, the United States government has taken the right
position that Elian should be with his father,'' one Cuban official
said. ``But it has failed to carry out its own laws mostly because
it fears upsetting the right-wing (Cuban-American) community in
Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred L. Padula, professor emeritus of history at the
University of Southern Maine in Portland and a former State
Department Cuba analyst, said he was cautiously optimistic about
warming relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been disappointed so many times in the past, but it
seems to be kind of a real drift of a renewal of relations,''
Padula said.
</P>
<P>
   One factor, he noted, may be changing American attitudes toward
Cuba. Those perceptions, he said, may be subtly altered by the
pictures of Elian himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those saying we can't send Elian back to terrible Cuba because
life would be hell for Elian, well, take a look at Elian,'' Padula
said. ``He looks pretty healthy to me. Maybe that says Cuba isn't
so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cardenas and the anti-Castro Cuban-American foundation,
however, the perception about Cuba that must endure is this:
Elian's mother risked and lost her life trying to escape the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cuban community is like a wounded bear right now,'' he
said. ``There is a tremendous sense of frustration, and we will
very much advocate that Cuban-Americans work out their frustrations
at the ballot box.''

REENACTMENT PARAPHERNALIA   MORE REALISTIC THAN EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY TAYLOR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Mass. -- A generation ago, reenactors of
Revolutionary War skirmishes often took liberties with dress and
gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to see people in cutoff chinos with rubber bands,
people with plastic pistols and cartridge pouches made from
handbags,'' said Henry Cooke of Randolph, a historical tailor and
authority on clothing, military uniforms, and accouterments of the
1770s and 1780s. Another example was what he called a ``Coney
Island tricorn,'' a rigid caricature of a militiaman's hat.
</P>
<P>
   That has all changed. Since the 200th anniversary of the 19th of
April of '75, a flurry of works by historians _ Robert Gross's
``Minutemen and Their World'' and David Hackett Fischer's ``Paul
Revere's Ride'' notable among them _ and a proliferation of Web
sites by living history groups have spread the word about
authenticity to every Middlesex village and farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scholarship has improved vastly in the last 25 years,'' Cooke
said. ``Most people can dial up enough sources of information to
put together a credible interpretation that looks well. We're not
just recreational reenactors but educators.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the meticulous reenactors on both sides of Battle Road
engagements next weekend will be David Workman, a Wakefield artist
whose militiaman is loosely based on Nathaniel Cowdrey, a Reading
farmer 225 years ago, and Roger Fuller of Northborough, who next
struts in public as both a grenadier and light infantryman with His
Majesty's 40th Regiment of Foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than a hobby,'' said Fuller, 43, a former German
teacher and camera shop proprietor whose grenadier uniform was
custom made by Cooke. ``It's a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Not an inexpensive one. The replica .75-caliber Brown Bess
muskets with 42-inch barrels that he and Workman carry cost about
$700 today. Fuller estimates that his entire grenadier's outfit,
including musket, sword, bayonet, canteen, cap, knapsack,
haversack, and oilskin gaiters, costs about $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   An authentic militiaman's clothing, musket, and gear would come
to $2,200, perhaps less if the reenactor made his own clothing,
according to Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grenadiers were the elite, the ones who wouldn't turn and
run,'' Fuller said as he and Workman were photographed in full
regalia outside Workman's home in Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 5 feet 10, and my bearskin cap makes me 7 feet tall. I
carry a gray blanket and a goatskin-covered knapsack, good for
water-proofing. My woolen jacket, with epaulets, is madder red,
from dye of the madder plant. The leather cross belts, woolen
waistcoat, and breeches are buff. The gaiters are oilskin. The
jacket buttons are pewter, made from castings of originals found in
an 1815 excavation in New York from the Battle of Brooklyn, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuller's bearskin cap has a brass plate with the Latin motto,
``Nic Aspera Terrent.'' ``Roughly translated, `Difficulties be
damned,' '' Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   He began the hobby in November 1997, 22 years after Workman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw an ad in a local newspaper by a militia company looking
for volunteers,'' said Workman, 52.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be fun. Since becoming involved, I've
steeped myself in the history of the period. We read lots of books
and we pick up information from each other. There's a world of
difference in the information available to us. Daniel Chester
French's minuteman statue at the North Bridge is full of
19th-century mistakes, for example. The huge hammer lock on the
musket is out of proportion. And there definitely were no
shirtsleeves on the 19th of April. We know that that day was not
that warm. His farmer has his coat on a plow. They'd all have had a
coat or jacket on that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for dark gray gaiters, which stretch from his shoetops to
over his knees, Workman's militiaman outfit is a study in browns _
felt hat, capable of being cocked, kerchief around his neck, a
linen jacket and waistcoat, buttons of wood, and leather breeches.
He carries a wooden canteen. From his waist belt hang a bayonet and
hatchet. Slung over his shoulder is a knapsack containing a blanket
and such provisions as salt cod, dried corn and peas.
</P>
<P>
   Workman will join the encampment April 13-17 at Lincoln Park in
Lexington, but he said he hasn't decided whether to sleep overnight
in a tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in a few hundred reenactments over the years,'' he
said, ``but this is a big one.''
</P>
<P>
   Workman belongs to the 2d and the 10th Massachusetts regiments,
both formed later in the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller's grenadier uniform includes a perforated brass
cannister, worn on his cross belt, which would contain a ``slow
match,'' or smoldering cotton cord soaked in a phosphorus compound.
This was used to light the fuses of grenades these soldiers
carried. But the actual grenadiers on the Battle Road 225 years ago
carried no grenades, Fuller said, and neither does he.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grenades were used in storming fortifications,'' Fuller said.
``Of course, there weren't any fortifications in America.''

England, drawing units from 26 states, Canada, and Great Britain.
Organizers expect an audience of 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the events of April 19-20, 1775, will be
reenacted in the order they occurred. Battle Road opens an
eight-year series of Revolution reenactments at their original
sites along the East Coast, destined to end in Yorktown.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere features a dozen major production numbers,
including an encampment with 400 tents that opens Thursday, a huge
fife and drum muster on Friday night, memorial tributes to the
British, Colonial craft exhibitions, parades, and severallarge
battle reenactments.
</P>

   Paul Revere will be arrested in Lincoln at the site of the
original capture, in real time, at 1 a.m. Saturday. Five hours
later, more than 500 British Regulars will march down Massachusetts
Avenue and face the 77 minutemen on Lexington Green. ``The shot
heard round the world'' will be fired. The rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excitement is building,'' said Colonel Gardner ``Skip''
Hayward, commander of Battle Road 2000 and the D.W. Griffith of the
production. ``This will be more than three times the size of the
largest Battle Road we have ever had, including a record number of
British.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayward and his staff of 30 have been planning the event for
four years. Battle Road reenactments are a traditional part of
Patriots Day, but this year the cast is surpassed only by the 1981
Yorktown event in Virginia, the largest American Revolution
reenactment ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge,'' said Hayward, a member of the Lexington
Minutemen, president of the Lexington Historical Society, and an
ex-Marine. ``It's also complicated. Most reenactments are held on a
single field, or in a large, open area. This one stretches through
three towns, goes in and around Minute Man National Park, and at
sites along parts of Route 2A into Lexington.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle Road commemorates the day when 700 Redcoats were sent to
seize Colonial arms and supplies in Concord. Minutemen confronted
them in Lexington and Concord. More minutemen answered the alarm
from Acton, Arlington, Bedford, Carlisle, Chelmsford, Groton,
Lincoln, and many other towns.
</P>
<P>
   Outnumbered, the Regulars retreated to Charlestown, fighting a
series of skirmishes along the way. The Colonials lost 49 dead, 40
wounded, and five missing; British losses were 73 dead, 174
wounded, and 26 missing.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers only begin to express the solemnity and importance
of Battle Road, which Brandeis history professor David Hackett
Fischer called ``a pivotal point in world history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened at Lexington and Concord symbolized, clarified,
crystallized a great transformation in the western world,'' Fischer
said. ``Henry James called it `the hinge on which the future was to
turn.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It set people thinking in a new way, about new ideas _ that
government exists not to strengthen the power of the state but to
serve the greatest good for the greatest number, that it was
possible to solve public and historic questions in terms of reason,
that free markets are the key to growth and prosperity _ all ideas
fundamental to our way of life. And none of them existed before
1775.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer's 1994 book, ``Paul Revere's Ride,'' is widely praised
by historians for clarifying some of the confused events and
popular mythology of Battle Road. The book is especially
appreciated by living-history hobbyists, to whom ``authenticity is
everything,'' Hayward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That book is our bible,'' he said. ``It has helped us
tremendously. We have the highest standards of authenticity for
Battle Road. We have come a long way from the reenactments of the
'20s, when the British marched in red bathrobes.''
</P>
<P>
   For veteran reenactor Henry Cooke of Randolph, who among other
roles will march Saturday as a member of the 10th Massachusetts
Regiment, the impact of living history is personal and immediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes for a few fleeting moments it seems real,'' Cooke
said. ``You get a sense of what it was like to be frightened out of
your wits when a column of Redcoats comes at you, with bayonets
fixed, looking 7 feet tall in their fur hats. You feel the fear the
common man must have felt. You realize that these were ordinary
people in extraordinary times.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer appreciates the show as well as the history lesson. He
cited ``a wonderful scene'' two years ago at Battle Road featuring
historical interpreter Myles McConnon of Bolton, who was helping
answer questions along the bike path in the national park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I observed that the Regulars and the minutemen were out in
force, and so were the cyclists, dressed as if they had descended
from another planet, with their helmets and vinyl cycling suits,''
Fischer said. ``They were coming up in family groups, and they
stopped when they saw Myles in character, dressed in his
18th-century civilian costume.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the children who noticed first. They screeched to a
halt and began to gather around Myles as he talked. And then their
parents came over, and soon after another cyclist, and then
another. Pretty soon there was a crowd, and it occurred to me that
the impact of the event was striking home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a teacher, I think this is one of the great teaching
opportunities, to help explain a moment in world history. The
impact of that battle reverberated through the Colonies and then it
began to spread around the world, not only to Britain and Europe,
but to other places as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to think of a moment that has had such a sharp
impact on our lives,'' Fischer said. ``There's that political
slogan, `Think nationally but act locally.' Here, it was, `Act
locally and think universally.' ''

HE IS THERE: PASSING MUSTER AS A MINUTEMAN

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Mass. _ When in the course of human events it becomes
necessary to don short pants and fight the Redcoats, I am there.
</P>
<P>
   I am a member of Colonel Bailey's 2nd Massachusetts Regiment,
enlisting for three hours to experience the living history hobby on
a sunny Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It's a glorious day for time travel here on the grounds of
Buckman Tavern. You can step off Massachusetts Avenue and into
1775. Or you can drift in on the strains of ``Yankee Doodle'' on
the fife and drum and join the 300 men, women and children at the
``muster.''
</P>
<P>
   The event is a sort of dress rehearsal for Battle Road 2000, the
five-day pageant scheduled April 13-17 to celebrate the 225th
anniversary of the battle of Lexington and Concord with a cast of
2,000, the largest Revolutionary War reenactment ever held in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   I am turned out in a striking red and blue ensemble provided by
my haberdasher/historian, Henry Cooke of Randolph. This
hand-stitched, authentic garb is comfortable: red coat with
hand-embroidered buttons, matching breeches, buff stockings, blue
waistcoat, and a floppy black hat, roughly the same outfit my
brother wears golfing.
</P>
<P>
   Should I adopt a persona, as many re-enactors do, or just wing
it? Being a raw recruit, I go with Option 2. I'm a well-dressed,
generic minuteman from Reading. I carry a musket, a .69-caliber
French Charleville replica that is heavy, awkward, and (by design)
doesn't work. It's just my kind of weapon.
</P>
<P>
   I am also equipped with a wooden canteen, which I plan to fill
later at the tavern, and a leather cartridge box (only one
cartridge; don't tell the Brits). A sharp, pointy thing is attached
by a fine chain to the box. I wonder what it is, besides my most
effective armament.
</P>
<P>
   I report to the commanding officer of Bailey's, Captain Brad
Chetwynd, 58, of Dracut, a veteran of more than 500 reenactments in
25 years of ``the hobby.'' He is turned out in a snappy purple
``sleeved waistcoat'' made by his wife, Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   The captain sizes me up and steers me toward the rear rank of
the 50-member troop. On the way, he gives me the lowdown on
musters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of veterans before the Revolution, colonists
who had fought on the British side in the French and Indian War,''
Chetwynd tells me. ``They would hold periodic militia days, or
muster days, not only for military training but as a social outing
for the families. It became a major social event. Of course at some
point, the rum keg would be broken out.''
</P>
<P>
   My captain places me carefully in the last rank, alongside other
``private soldiers.'' They are a friendly lot, people who make
their own authentic outfits, sign e-mails to each other ``Yr
Obedient Servant,'' and grumble good-naturedly in 18th-century
vernacular about Army life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lads,'' says Captain Chetwynd. ``Stand by for a safety
inspection and a clothing inspection. We'll get orders soon from
the commanding officer, whom I happen to know personally.'' Eric
Chetwynd, one of Brad's two sons, is commander of the 1st Battalion
for the Battle Road event.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we drill. I am an inept soldier, but my comrades are
indulgent, having fought for the inalienable American right to fake
it. I love this hat, but the huge brim is a liability on the parade
ground. I keep knocking it off with my musket when the order is
``shoulder arms.'' It might well be ``dislodge hats.'' I keep
jabbing myself with the sharp, pointy thing.
</P>
<P>
   I try to focus on not injuring anyone with my Charleville as
shoulder-to-shoulder (and I mean exactly that) we practice
marching, pivoting, and facing about. There is a neat maneuver
where we all face about quickly, each grabbing his cartridge box so
it doesn't swing out and whack the neighbors. I have to grab my hat
instead.
</P>
<P>
   So I apologize to those I whack with my cartridge box: Kimball
Tarr of Merrimac; Troy Richards and Patrick Fennelly of Reading;
Larry Sands, Dave Pirie, and Tom Frary of Marblehead; Mike Thompson
of Haverhill; Jeff Rider of Hudson, N.H., and Cathy Sminkey of
Chelmsford, known in the troop as ``Charles.'' Also, her husband,
Scott. Also, those two 9-year-old drummers, the elderly fifer, and
the bicyclist. The British sergeant major I whacked on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did fine,'' says the regiment's first sergeant, Mark
Nowacki of Wilmington. He acknowledges the drill is not always
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes `dress right' looks like `sidle right' or `drift
right,' '' he says, to the amusement of the lads. ``And then
there's ``mill about, smartly.''
</P>
<P>
   To my great joy, he brings up the sharp, pointy things, even
calling them that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget, `Adjust pointy things,' '' he says, ``or the
ever-popular, `Hurl pointy things!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, ``What's that pointy thing?'' is a common question
among spectators. It's called a vent pick, Nowacki says, used for
cleaning the vent on the side of the musket.
</P>
<P>
   We ``stand down'' for a rest. I seek advice from a more
experienced soldier, Sterling T. Wall of Shirley. This 11-year-old
sixth-grader has done dozens of reenactments, including Quebec and
Mount Vernon, with his father, Sterling Wall. The youth gives me a
few pointers, along with his reason for being here: ``It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling the elder drills us, then demonstrates how to load a
musket, a procedure largely lost on us because I am a noncombatant,
and Sterling the younger uses an all-wood weapon.
</P>
<P>
   We fall in for the final assembly. As we hurry up and wait, a
splendidly dressed British officer watches us from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lads,'' says our captain, ``you might notice that British
officer over there, with his beautiful new boots. Take a good look.
I might remind you that your captain has no boots.''
</P>
<P>
   The call sounds for assembly. To drum and fife, we parade by the
townspeople. A sudden gust of wind whisks my hat 20 feet away. I
cannot break ranks and fetch it without embarrassing the unit. A
kindly camp follower rushes in to retrieve it. She catches up to
the troop, hands it to me, smiles encouragement. No one breaks
stride.
</P>
<P>
   Now I get it. With that little drama, I transcend time. Because
the action is unscripted, I am not consciously pretending. I just
need my hat. For a few brief moments, I am definitely in the 18th
century.
</P>
<P>
   At assembly, the Battle Road commander, Colonel Gardner ``Skip''
Hayward of the Lexington minutemen, offers bold words against the
crown, which the entire company punctuates with spirited shouts of
``Huzzah! Huzzah!'' in unison.
</P>
<P>
   We are dismissed. My enlistment is up. I say good day to my
captain, who invites me to reenlist anytime. As I head for the
stables, I'm thinking that the hobby offers something for everyone,
be it research into geneaology, military tactics, encampment,
cooking in the manner of the time, music, or clothing.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the intangibles are the attraction. I mean, how often do
you get a chance to be among a crowd that shouts ``Huzzah!
Huzzah!'' in unison?

EVEN AS EXILE, HE ARGUES FOR AID TO COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Each lives in exile in Miami, just a few miles
apart, their families left behind, their fate in Washington's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where the lives of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez of Cuba
and 38-year-old Francisco Santos of Colombia part. Americans have
been seeing pictures of Elian on his swingset every day, caught in
a media glare so bright that it has obscured a world of other
stories, particularly in Cuba's backyard _ tensions in Venezuela
and Ecuador, an assassination of a journalist in Haiti, and
questions about elections in Peru and Haiti, among them.
</P>
<P>
   It has also obscured much of what is happening in Colombia, the
country from which ``Pancho'' Santos fled last month. Several Latin
American experts say his story has far greater ramifications for US
national interests than the drama of whether a boy and his father
will be reunited.
</P>
<P>
   Santos left his homeland after he learned a guerrilla commander
in the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia _ known as the FARC _
had ordered his death. The guerrillas were angered by newspaper
columns Santos wrote that were critical of the guerrillas'
reluctance to make peace in that country's ongoing civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Although Colombians routinely flee their country's violence,
Santos's departure shocked Colombians and US policy makers alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is someone from one of the most prominent families of
Colombia, running the largest newspaper, a leader in the peace
movement, having to flee. It's like having (former Washington Post
publisher) Katharine Graham forced out of the country,'' said Adam
Isacson, senior associate at the Center for International Policy.
``It means even in Bogota, even among the elite, you're not safe
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Santos's escape adds to the mounting anecdotal evidence that
Colombia is growing ever more violent, just at the time when
Congress debates whether to send $1.7 billion to fight drugs along
the Andean ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Should that add urgency in favor of passing the funding package?
Or should it give members of Congress pause before committing to a
deteriorating situation?
</P>
<P>
   Santos, a former Nieman Foundation fellow at Harvard University,
believes Washington should approve the money; if it doesn't, he
said, it would be a ``huge blow'' to Colombia President Andres
Pastrana, who has pushed for a peace agreement. Santos quietly
delivered that message last week to several members of Congress at
a dinner arranged by US Representative William Delahunt, a
Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said, in an interview later, that he would prefer to
see the US anti-drug spending come in the form of, say, $150
million to use on alternative crop development, rather than 63
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives hope for the future,'' Santos said, relaxing in the
elegant sitting room at the home of his friend Luis Alberto Moreno,
Colombia's ambassador to the United States. Seven vases of cut
Colombian roses were arranged around the room, a silver bowl of
unwrapped chocolates were not far from his fingers. ``The plan is
critically important now. Otherwise, if it doesn't happen, it could
generate a lot more violence. There's still going to be violence no
matter what, but we need a symbol of hope to move forward. And the
only hope is now the States.''
</P>
<P>
   Santos could be a character out of a Gabriel Garcia Marquez
novel, his story having the feel of his country's history _ the
boyish aristocrat kidnapped by drug lords, chained to a bed for 263
days, let go and years later leading a massive peace movement
called ``No Mas,'' or No More. And now, living far from home, apart
from his wife and their four children.
</P>
<P>
   But, in Santos's case, real life made a better story than
fiction; rather than write a novel about Santos, Garcia Marquez
wrote a nonfiction account of his kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   And Santos's life has, at times, seemed stranger than fiction.
Only four days after he was released in 1990, Santos found himself
in Cambridge, Mass., accepted as a fellow in Harvard's journalism
program, getting a taste of life in the United States for a year
before returning to the struggle in his country.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back, in exile, and will attend a Nieman reunion later
this month, as he tries to readjust to life here. He says he's
finding it extremely difficult, and he deeply misses his wife and
children, who stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some days when I can barely get out of bed. I say,
`Why am I here? My life is there, my country is there.' It's a lot
harder than I thought,'' Santos said. ``I'm even getting flashbacks
from the time of my kidnapping. I'm doing math equations in my
head. It's been 10 years since I did this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he harbors no second thoughts about leaving; he had heard
for months that a FARC commander wanted him dead, and early last
month he became sure of it when a known hit squad came looking for
him in a restaurant only minutes after he had left.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to Washington last week invigorated Santos. Robert
White, former US ambassador to El Salvador and Paraguay and now
president of the Center for International Policy in Washington,
said he was most impressed with one of Santos's suggestions for
congressmen: Go visit the guerrillas _ the people who want Santos
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands that you need to include them,'' White said.
``I think he will go back. Some of us will be working on the FARC
to try to get some guarantees for his safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Santos said he would return if the peace process advances
significantly, or if, as he put it, ``I get tired of this and go
home and risk my life.''

IT'S RUSSIA'S VERY LIVED-IN GHOST TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ In a dimly-lit room on the sixth floor
of a crumbling walk-up, Konstantin the Wizard faced a pale thin
young woman. He lit a candle, asked the woman to close her eyes,
and began the ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantin waved the candle clockwise, forming large circles in
front of the woman. After the seventh circle, he made seven signs
of the cross. He repeated the procedure three more times _ from
behind the woman, to her left and to her right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this dirt!'' Konstantin said as he pointed to the
greenish wax that oozed from the candle. ``This was inside her. It
is the negative energy that was disturbing her.''
</P>
<P>
   Konstantin sees ghosts everywhere and he knows how to get rid of
them _ a craft he said he learned from his grandfather. For $35, he
will cleanse an apartment of evil spirits. For $20 he will wave his
magic candle and purge people of what he calls ``bad energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Konstantin won't give his last name. His advertisement in local
newspapers reads simply ``Wizard,'' and gives his telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you feel any better? Do you feel lighter?'' Konstantin
asked the woman, who had been suffering from stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I do. I feel like I could fall asleep,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good. Now I want you to imagine all the people, living or
dead, who have hurt you, and I want you to forgive them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them I can't forgive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive them!'' he commanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgive them,'' she said softly, after a long pause.
</P>
<P>
   Most large cities have their ghost legends, and one can find
people like Konstantin anywhere in the world, but St. Petersburg
provides a particularly fertile ground for the services he offers.
</P>
<P>
   This town takes its ghosts seriously.
</P>
<P>
   People here will tell you with a straight face that spirits roam
St. Petersburg's streets, canals, alleys, and courtyards. Stay here
long enough and you begin to believe them.
</P>
<P>
   There is something about the way dilapidated buildings here cast
rippling shadows on the canals, the way the wind oozes through the
maze-like adjoining courtyards, which suggests that even when you
are alone _ you are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Below, in unmarked graves, lie the remains of hundreds of
thousands of people who died building the city three centuries ago
_ earning St. Petersburg the ghastly moniker ``Gorod na Kostyakh,''
the ``City on the Bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Even politicians here feel the need to pay homage to the
supernatural aura. Anatoly Sobchak, the city's former mayor, had
admitted to believing in mysticism. He said he was convinced that
Russia was doomed to endless tribulations until the remains of
Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin were removed from their Red Square
mausoleum and given a proper burial.
</P>
<P>
   And the city's current leader, Vladimir Yakovlev, has invoked
other worldly explanations for tragic misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
   In June of last year, when the roof of a downtown subway station
collapsed, killing seven people, Yakovlev suggested that a vengeful
God _ as opposed to municipal negligence _ had caused the tragedy.
He noted that Communist authorities, in the 1960s, had destroyed a
church to build the subway station.
</P>
<P>
   Lev Lurie, a prominent local historian, conceded that St.
Petersburg ``is definitely a very strange city,'' but said he does
not believe in the supernatural. ``Everything here can be explained
rationally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border between the mystical and the rational in St.
Petersburg is very thin,'' said Viktor Krivulin, a local poet.
``Looking at St. Petersburg's history without the mystical element
is like playing Chopin on the piano and only using the white
keys.''

POLICY REVIEW ON CUBA LIKELY, US OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once the shouting stops in the Elian Gonzalez case,
the larger issue of US-Cuba relations is headed for a broad
reexamination in the coming months, Clinton administration
officials and members of Congress say.
</P>
<P>
   The result could soon be a number of small but portentous new
changes in the prickly relationship, from new exemptions to the US
trade embargo and making it easier for Cuban-Americans to visit the
island, to a possible weakening of the political clout of exiles in
Florida and elsewhere who are opposed to Cuban President Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic and Republican members of Congress have
predicted a backlash against the Cuban-American protesters in Miami
for their vociferous demands that the boy stay in the United
States. National polls show 60 percent of Americans favor reuniting
the boy with his father, who now waits in a Cuban diplomat's home
in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   It is also significant, said three US officials in interviews
last week, that for the first time in recent memory US and Cuban
governments were publicly and prominently working together on the
same side of an issue _ reuniting father and son.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is likely to produce a dramatic change in the near
term, the US officials said, but it is expected to create a renewed
focus on US policy toward the island and could spur incremental
changes in the longstanding American trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will continue to look at constructive ways of
moving things ahead in small ways,'' said one US official, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``I don't expect anything dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has had a unilateral economic embargo against
Cuba for nearly four decades, sanctions that began with the premise
_ now largely discounted _ that Cuba was a threat to US security.
Four years ago, Clinton signed the Helms-Burton law, which further
tightened the terms of the embargo, giving Congress the power to
approve any major changes toward normalization with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to enact some small changes is either up for
consideration in Congress or is being prepared in congressional
offices. Among the possibilities in the next year: legislation that
would exempt food and medicine from the embargo and would allow
easier terms for exiles to visit family in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the two governments have cooperated in
smaller endeavors. The most promising one is the sharing of
information in antidrug operations. Officials also have worked
together on environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Many more Americans have begun touring Cuba in recent years as
travel restrictions have eased. The Clinton administration has also
allowed Cuban-Americans to send larger remittances to their
families back home and has opened the embargo slightly to permit
sales of certain agricultural and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But since Elian was found floating barely conscious on an inner
tube near Fort Lauderdale more than four months ago and the custody
issue became so contentious, officials in the White House and
National Security Council have carefully skirted issues having to
do with Cuba. One White House official said there has been no
e-mail traffic on Cuban issues over the last several months. That
is highly unusual, the official said, calling it an indicator of
the political sensitivity arising from the custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the battle over Cuba policy already is bubbling up, whether
senior US officials like it or not, and Cuban-Americans are girding
to defend the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite clear that the strategy of the left and other
sundry embargo haters on this issue is to exploit some of the
dynamics of this Elian issue to demonize the Cuban-American
community and, by extension, delegitimize US policy toward Cuba,''
said Jose R. Cardenas, Washington director of the Cuban American
National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if a hound has picked up the scent of the
fox,'' he continued. ``I have in mind someone like (US
Representative) Maxine Waters. They smell blood and they are
proceeding apace. I think it is a great miscalculation on their
part. I see a rejuvenated Cuban-American community that is going to
be even more vigilant to anybody attempting to exploit the Elian
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters, a California Democrat, could not be reached for comment,
but her spokesman, Frank Phillips said, ``Her main focus is
reuniting the son with his father. She's never been in favor of
politicizing this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters had previously called for closer US-Cuba relations. She
is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat and member of
the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview that a
reevaluation of relations with Cuba was ``way overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a frozen, stalemated, counterproductive policy that is
not in humanitarian interests nor in our larger credibility
interest in the region,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   While saying that US diplomats should not unilaterally remove
the sanctions, he said, ``There is just a complete and total
contradiction between the way we deal with China, the way we dealt
with Russia, the way we have been dealing with Cuba over the last
(several) years. It speaks volumes about the problems in the
current American electoral process. . . . The only reason we don't
reevaluate the policy is the politics of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida and New Jersey, Cuban-Americans form powerful voting
blocs, giving them key leverage in the presidential electoral
counts. Both major presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Governor George W. Bush, have sided with those who want
Elian to stay in the United States, saying they want a family court
to decide the issue, not the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican, said there was ``no
question that the mishandling of this case is going to have
consequences in the future regarding Cuban-American policy. Will it
change? Of course it's going to change. We have an irrelevant
anachronistic policy toward Cuba. Everyone is trading with Castro
and Cuba except the US.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel, who cosponsored legislation to exempt food and medicine
from the embargo, said the debate over Elian has ``brought some
transparency to the political hold that the anti-Castro
Cuban-Americans have held on Florida and New Jersey politics. It
holds the same hostage factor on American politics because of the
larger electoral votes in Florida and New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, government officials are less optimistic that the Elian
drama has created openings for Havana and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true, the United States government has taken the right
position that Elian should be with his father,'' one Cuban official
said. ``But it has failed to carry out its own laws mostly because
it fears upsetting the right-wing (Cuban-American) community in
Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred L. Padula, professor emeritus of history at the
University of Southern Maine in Portland and a former State
Department Cuba analyst, said he was cautiously optimistic about
warming relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been disappointed so many times in the past, but it
seems to be kind of a real drift of a renewal of relations,''
Padula said.
</P>
<P>
   One factor, he noted, may be changing American attitudes toward
Cuba. Those perceptions, he said, may be subtly altered by the
pictures of Elian himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those saying we can't send Elian back to terrible Cuba because
life would be hell for Elian, well, take a look at Elian,'' Padula
said. ``He looks pretty healthy to me. Maybe that says Cuba isn't
so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cardenas and the anti-Castro Cuban-American foundation,
however, the perception about Cuba that must endure is this:
Elian's mother risked and lost her life trying to escape the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cuban community is like a wounded bear right now,'' he
said. ``There is a tremendous sense of frustration, and we will
very much advocate that Cuban-Americans work out their frustrations
at the ballot box.''

RENAISSANCE IN TROUBLED AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda _ With the Cold War and apartheid consigned to
history, it has become fashionable among African leaders and
intellectuals to talk of an African ``renaissance,'' an era of hope
and progress flowering on the world's most troubled continent.
</P>
<P>
   That notion _ the centerpiece of a conference this weekend near
Johannesburg _ invites skepticism. Africa still appears to be a
playground of malevolent forces. Critics point no further than
Congo, where 10 sovereign states and 11 guerrilla armies wage
tangled wars and cart off natural resources. As The Economist
magazine's intelligence unit put it, ``one obvious casualty of
(Congo) is the African renaissance. . . . That vision now lies in
ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   But such conclusions dismiss the fundamental difference between
Africa's past and present conflicts: For the first time since
Portuguese trading ships anchored off the coast of Angola 500 years
ago, Africa is determining its own course. The conflict in Congo _
dubbed the continent's ``first world war'' _ marks the birth, not
the death, of a new African order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africans should resolve their own problems as they understand
them,'' said Bizima Karaha, leader of one rebel faction fighting
against the Congolese government. ``That is the beginning of the
African renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, when Makau Mutua, a human rights lawyer from Kenya,
first presented the concept of an African renaissance,
inconceivable changes were sweeping the globe. The Soviet Union had
vanished, Germany reunified, democratic reforms galloped across
Eastern Europe, and the Balkans had not yet revealed their horrors.
</P>
<P>
   Across Africa, the end of the Cold War broke the grip of long
civil wars and brutal dictatorships. Angola and Mozambique, two
US-Soviet battlegrounds since 1974, were moving toward a negotiated
peace. Nelson Mandela was a free man and apartheid was crumbling.
Countries from Mali to Zambia were ceding to popular demands for
pluralism. ``Africans stand at the threshold of a new epoch . . .
(a) democratic renaissance,'' Mutua declared.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1990s turned out to be one of the bloodiest decades on
record in Africa. Rwanda horrified the world with an ethnic
genocidal rampage carried out with more efficiency than the Nazi
campaign against Europe's Jews: some 800,000 people slaughtered in
less than three months. Angola's peace process collapsed and the
country is now back to war. An estimated 16,000 South Africans died
in the final throes of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Such foul play is not over. Ivory Coast rang in the new year
with a military coup d'etat. Namibian President Sam Nujoma altered
the country's constitution to extend his rule. Soldiers mutilated
civilians in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   It is conceivable, even probable, that things will worsen before
they get better. As peace efforts falter in Congo, rising ethnic
hatred threatens to transport the fighting to Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   But the turmoil in Africa today is inevitable, as the old order
_ shaped by colonialism and the Cold War _ breaks apart. These
conflicts, while easily misread, represent a kind of progress, a
march toward a more stable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are principled wars,'' said Patrick Mazimhaka, Rwanda's
chief peace negotiator in Congo. ``They have nothing to do with
American policies in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Positive trends course beneath the tumultuous surface.
Devastated by one of Africa's longest civil wars, Mozambique is
today a model of accommodation. Two parties that once fought each
other with unspeakable brutality contested their second peaceful,
democratic elections in December. Bush warfare has given way to
parliamentary debate.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, civil society is making a brave stand against an
increasingly violent and menacing autocrat. While President Robert
Mugabe manipulates racial and political tensions ahead of
parliamentary elections next month, a growing opposition movement
rallies the public to force a peaceful end to bad governance.
</P>
<P>
   Blind non-interference, the longstanding first tenet of African
diplomacy, is yielding as Africans engage in a more concerted
approach to progress. They are forging integrated regional markets
and espousing higher ideals of governance. Perhaps most important,
the gun is no longer the first tool of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go through this period of chaos to sort out the
mess. Had the Cold War not been so hot in Africa, people might have
worried more about good governance,'' said Jan van Eck, a
specialist on Central Africa at the Center for Conflict Resolution
in Cape Town. ``Africa has a culture of violence: If you have a
problem, shoot at it. Now we need to legitimize dialogue as a means
for solving problems.''
</P>
<P>
   That's happening with greater frequency. African leaders from
Uganda to South Africa have been involved almost continuously in
seeking a solution to Congo since the war broke out 20 months ago.
Their failure so far does not subtract from the significance of
their efforts, argued Cedric de Coning, an analyst at the African
Center for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes in Durban. The
process itself is unprecedented in African diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi's fractured parties last November tapped Mandela to
jump-start their stalled talks on ending the central African
state's civil war. Last week Mandela brought in Olusegun Obasanjo,
the new democratic president of Nigeria, to help push for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Both men made urgent appeals for movement toward majority rule.
But their presence alone was more significant than anything either
could have said. Never before have South Africa and Nigeria been
ruled by democratic leaders at the same time. The joint involvement
of Mandela and Obasanjo in Burundi illustrates the potential
stabilizing influence of the budding relationship between their two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Africa is not totally unfettered by foreign influences and
global economics. France admitted to organizing the coup in Ivory
Coast. ``But foreign powers don't have the leverage they used to
have,'' Van Eck said. ``We're in a completely different era.''
</P>
<P>
   The continent today rests in the hands of a new generation of
political and business leaders. Many were schooled in the West,
most were forged by struggles not against colonialism but the
corrupt authoritarian regimes that followed. They experiment with
democratic models and design grand visions. Their policies have
sometimes drawn suspicions _ Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
allows no parties; Paul Kagame, the military wunderkind from
Rwanda, launched two wars against Congo (formerly Zaire) in pursuit
of ethnic harmony _ but they reflect African aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the new architects of an African renaissance is
Thabo Mbeki, the new president of South Africa. A formidable
intellect, Mbeki seeks a vigorous African transformation from
poverty and misrule to prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, South Africa's white rulers bombed African
capitals, sabotaged power pylons and railroad tracks, and fought
bush wars to prevent black rule at home. Today, South Africa is the
driving force of integration, security, and development on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such change, Mbeki knows that negative images carry
further. At an economic summit in Namibia nearly two years ago, he
told a fable of a fictional town in Mississippi. When Somalis
consume their country in clan rivalry and Togo's president steals
an election, he said, and then Africans speak of a renaissance, the
people of that Mississippi town laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we must stop the laughter,'' Mbeki said. ``We have to
rebel against political instability on our continent, because when
something goes wrong in Somalia, the residents of Dead Man's Creek
do not say something has gone wrong in Somalia. They say something
has gone wrong in Africa. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``To achieve an African renewal in politics, in economics, in
social life, and in culture we have to act together as Africans. If
we are not willing to do it, the citizens of Dead Man's Creek will
continue to laugh.''

MARGINAL BEHAVIOR: THIS BUBBLE SURE LOOKS FAMILIAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the spring of 1928, when the Federal Reserve was
trying to restrain stock market speculation by tightening credit, a
visitor to the office of Roy Young, a Fed governor, found him
chuckling as he stared at the news ticker, which was reporting that
stock prices had risen sharply that day.
</P>
<P>
   Young explained, ``I am laughing at myself sitting here and
trying to keep 125 million people from doing what they want to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   What they wanted to do was buy stocks and get rich, and they
were borrowing more and more money to do so. So it has been over
the past year, as share prices have soared. Last week, as Wall
Street briefly plunged and then recovered, some of the selling came
from investors who had borrowed money to buy stocks and now had to
raise cash to pay their loans. But new money came into the market,
and prices soon stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   When Young was laughing, the volume of such stock market loans
was up 67 percent in less than two years. Many analysts feared that
a crash would ensue if a fall in prices forced many of those
speculators to sell their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1929, however, The New York Times was taking note
of the fact that even larger increases in such loans no longer
alarmed people. ``One of the most striking features of the present
chapter in stock market history,'' The Times reported on Sept. 1,
``is the failure of the trading community to take serious alarm at
portents which once threw Wall Street into a state of alarm
bordering on demoralization. In particular, the recent disregard of
the succession of `smashed high records' for brokers' loans
astonishes the older school of market operators.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowed money unquestionably played a role in the speculation
of the late 1920s, and after the 1929 crash Congress set out to
enact limits on it. Whereas speculators in 1929 could put down as
little as 10 percent of the purchase price to buy stocks, the new
law left it to the Federal Reserve to set limits. For decades the
Fed diligently raised the borrowing requirement when it thought
speculation was on the rise and cut it when it perceived less need
for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   But the last adjustment _ a reduction in the down payment for
stocks from 65 percent of the purchase price to 50 percent _ came
in 1974, in the midst of a severe bear market when few wanted to
take the risk anyway. Since then, the Fed has been on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with margin lending having risen sharply since last fall,
there are renewed worries about margin debt _ the money borrowed
from brokers to buy securities. Under current rules, if an
investor's stocks fall so far that he or she owes more than 75
percent of the value of his or her account, a margin call must go
out, forcing the investor to come up with more money or sell some
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Some brokerage houses impose stiffer rules, typically pulling
the plug when the debt hits 70 percent of the value of the account.
To translate that into Wall Street jargon, the brokers require a
``maintenance margin'' of 30 percent. The Securities and Exchange
Commission has been quietly trying to persuade all brokerage firms
to set the level at least that high for investors who own the most
volatile stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the two eras _ the 1920s and now _ shows some
similarities and some great differences in the use of borrowed
money to buy stocks. Now, as then, the Fed has been trying to
tighten credit by raising interest rates but has seen stock prices
soar as more and more money has been borrowed to buy shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lure of stock market profits had caught the public
imagination,'' the economist Benjamin Anderson wrote of the late
1920s in his 1949 book, ``Economics and the Public Welfare.'' ``And
the change in Federal Reserve policy, designed to restrict the
supply of money, met with an overpowering increase in the demand
for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Margin debt is now rising faster than it ever did in the 1920s,
when the peak annual increase was 56 percent. Over the 12 months
through the end of February 2000, the latest data available, the
increase was 75 percent, and most of that came after the Nasdaq
market began to take off in October 1999. The big runup in prices
that saw the Nasdaq average double from last summer through its
peak last month was fueled in part by borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the total volume of margin loans at last report was $252
billion, or just 1.7 percent of the value of stocks traded on the
New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, the two major stock markets. On
Sept. 1, 1929, by contrast, the $5.8 billion in brokers' loans, as
margin loans were then known, amounted to 9.5 percent of the value
of the stocks then traded.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to indicate there is far less leverage now, but
that may not be true. Today's investors have many more choices.
They can buy options and futures on stock indexes, each of which
allow a speculator to make a lot of money on a small investment _
if the market goes up. Those who want to borrow money to buy stocks
can take out a margin loan, or they can use their credit cards or
home equity loans. And, as everyone learned when the Long-Term
Capital Management hedge fund nearly failed in 1998, it is possible
for clever traders to borrow huge amounts of money to use in
playing the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has so far
resisted suggestions that the Fed raise the margin requirement from
the current level of 50 percent, arguing that such a move would not
affect the wealthier and more sophisticated investors who can use
the many other financial products now available.
</P>
<P>
   That means investors will be free to keep borrowing. And,
history shows, they will continue to do so if they remain confident
that stock prices are going to keep rising.

   WASHINGTON _ The actor Leonardo DiCaprio, the star of
``Titanic,'' assumed a new role, interviewing President Clinton
about global warming for ABC News. _  &UR; The New York Times &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo DiCaprio So dude. This place is awesome.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton Thank you, Leo.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. It's almost as big as my place in Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. I enjoyed ``Titanic.'' The ending made me sad.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Don't get me started. I told James Cameron, I said:
``Cameron, man, listen to me. Everyone should think I've drowned,
froze, whatever. Only, right at the end, I burst through the
surface of the water, all blue, because I've been holding my
breath.''
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Well that sure is neat. What'd he say?
</P>
<P>
   L.D. He said it was stupid. My guru says just let it go. Inner
harmony, that's my thing now. You hungry?
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Sure. We can get food here any time. What would you like?
</P>
<P>
   L.D. They've got me on this new diet. No dairy, no meat, no
carbonation. Apparently my chakras are blocked.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. I had that once. From heavy cream. Hey Bobby? Rustle up
some grub, would ya' son? A fruit plate for the King of the World
here and I'll have a couple of cheeseburgers and a pecan pie.
</P>
<P>
   (Pause)
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Dude. Is the world getting warmer or what?
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Well, Leo, that's a question of great concern to my
administration. In 1992, when I took office, I made a pledge to the
American people to place a ban on so-called CFC's,
chloroflourocarbons. In that time, due to the work of a bipartisan
commission ...
</P>
<P>
   L.D. You know who's cool is that John McCann.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. McCain?
</P>
<P>
   L.D. I guess. The Germans, they like tortured the guy for 20
years or something. B.C. I hadn't heard that.
</P>
<P>
   (Pause)
</P>
<P>
   L.D. I'm taking Tai Chi.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. That's nice.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. It's not just for old Chinese ladies, ya' know.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Is that so?
</P>
<P>
   L.D. I swear this room is round, not oval.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Hey! The food's here!
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Cool.
</P>
<P>
   (Long pause)
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Okay, so last summer, right? I'm out in L.A. in, like,
August and it's, I don't know, like 95 degrees. I'm sitting by the
pool, just, like, reading this book on breathing and I just
couldn't believe how hot it was. And I got to thinking, ``Is this
what they mean by global warming? Or is this just the summer?''
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Leo, you bring up an important point. Global warming is
something that concerns many Americans, indeed, many people all
over the world. When I was at Oxford, I read Rachel Carson's 1962
best-seller ``Silent Spring'' and it moved me very deeply. Then, in
1989, I read Bill McKibben's ``The End of Nature.'' It warned of a
rise in global temperatures of three to nine degrees over the
coming decades, a rise in sea levels to dangerous heights, heat
waves the likes of which mankind has never experienced. Pie?
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Sure.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Cool Whip? It's non-dairy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Pause)
</P>
<P>
   L.D. D'you ever watch ``Blind Date?''
</P>
<P>
   B.C. I love that show. And ``MTV Spring Break 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   (Pause)
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Dude, what is up with the ozone? There's a club in New
York, Oh-Zone, in the meat-packing district, but that's completely
different, right? The thing they're talking about, that's a place
in, like, space.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. That's right, Leo. The ozone is a thin, membranous layer
that protects the earth from harmful _ and potentially deadly _
ultraviolet radiation. Without the ozone layer, life on Earth
simply couldn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Wow.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. And that's why, in 1996, I urged the G-7 nations to act
with the United States to implement a first-of-its-kind treaty to
reduce ozone emissions in the major industrialized nations by the
year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Is this the same office that John Kennedy was in?
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. He was cool.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Why, yes, he was. I met him.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. No way. That was, like, a hundred years ago.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. It sure seems like it, but it was 1961.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. That's messed up. Was there global warming then?
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Certainly the beginnings of it, yes. And that's why my
administration ...
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Here's the thing I don't understand. No one really likes
the winter, right? I mean, people love getting away. And, like,
home heating oil is, I've heard, expensive. So why is global
warming a bad thing if it's keeping us all warm?
</P>
<P>
   B.C. You bring up an excellent question. I believe that the ...
</P>
<P>
   L.D. So how much longer you going to be president?
</P>
<P>
   B.C. A little less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. So how come you're leaving?
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Well, a president can only serve for two four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Dude, that's lame.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Well, listen. This has been great, but I'm meeting some
people in France. The Riviera. Just chill for a few days in the
sun. Global warming, man. That's where it's at.

UGANDA'S TRAUMA: A DEADLY CULT STIRS QUESTIONS ABOUT A NATION'S
SOUL

(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The news out of Uganda has been very bad, and
that nation's two daily newspapers have spared their readers none
of it. For three days running, the state-owned paper, The New
Vision, ran front-page, full-color photos of rotting corpses _ a
sad few of the perhaps 900 victims of a deadly cult, the Movement
for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures were so awful that investigators have now barred
cameras from any other grave sites they may find, a possibility
that is depressingly likely. The New Vision received many
complaints about the photos, perhaps loudest from government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thought the decision to publish them was wrong.
For Uganda has been groping for explanations for the mass killings,
and alongside sensationalism in the daily press there has been a
remarkably frank discussion of the roots of the problem _ most
interestingly, a tracing of the current religiosity and mysticism
associated with cults to the despair left by years of dictatorship,
poverty, AIDS and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion in the press, in both its liveliness and
thoughtfulness, mirrors a larger discussion taking place in Ugandan
society about the cult and the murders, and this reveals a great
deal about Uganda itself _ how far it has come in its tortured
passage of 38 years from independence, through a brutal
dictatorship and at last toward a society where open expression is
recognized as a tool for solving the nation's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to be shocked,'' said the Rev. John Mary Waliggo, a
Catholic priest who is one of Uganda's human rights commissioners
and a professor of African history, after the photos were
published. ``From this shock, we will be able to find out what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the pictures were just part of the aggressive coverage
of the cult murders by Uganda's two papers, The New Vision and The
Monitor, and their coverage has mirrored Ugandans' general
reaction: shock, horror, a search for blame, along with an ample
measure of ``What will the world think of Uganda now?''
</P>
<P>
   That last thought is predictable. It has been only 21 years
since the dictator Idi Amin was deposed after a rule of brutality
and death that made Uganda a synonym for state-sponsored horror.
</P>
<P>
   But in the years since, Uganda has developed in a way that might
surprise most outsiders. It has become one of the brightest spots
of central Africa, with a growing economy and an intriguing leader,
a left-leaning former rebel, Yoweri Museveni, who talks loudly
about his ideas for everything from cattle-rearing to toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were aware that it was a danger to Uganda's image abroad''
when the cult story broke, said William Pike, a Briton who is the
editor of The New Vision. ``But we didn't let that get in the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. In few African countries could a story headlined, ``Are
you in a cult?'' run next to another headlined, ``Why have I lost
my sex drive?'' This happened in the March 23 edition of The New
Vision. But while some of the coverage has been sensationalistic _
headlines like ``Another Grave!'' and speculation that the victims
may have actually been Muslim fundamentalists because some men were
circumcised _ most of it has been straight and has pulled few
punches.
</P>
<P>
   Both The Monitor (independent, with a circulation of 26,000) and
The New Vision (state owned but independent in its news coverage,
with a circulation of 35,000) have seriously posed the questions:
``Why this?'' and ``Why Uganda?''
</P>
<P>
   And so they have devoted much space to Uganda's history of
combining religion and violence (three rebel groups over the last
15 years have claimed religious inspiration). Over the years, the
papers have also spent much time looking into problems of poverty
and development and the spread of AIDS, which Waliggo said in an
interview is the chief culprit behind religious sects that have
healing and miracles as their hallmarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have sought healing as a religion,'' he said. ``Western
medicine can't heal them, and many fear African traditional
medicine.'' When people have problems, he said, they will turn to
whatever looks most attractive _ and Uganda happens to have more
than its fair share of fringe religious groups, many bordering on
mystical cults.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, the difference between religion and magic is very
narrow,'' he said. ``You can pass from one to the other very
easily. It is like sanity and insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more thoughtful newspaper coverage in this vein has
come from the editor of The Monitor, Charles Onyango-Obbo, who in
his columns has stitched together politics, poverty and the
failings of established churches in his search for answers as deep
as the problems his people face.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the shortcomings of religion, he wrote: ``There is
reason therefore to fear that what has been burnt and buried in
Kanungu are only the bodies of the members of the Movement for the
Restoration of the Ten Commandments. Its spirit remains very much
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that all the discussion here has been so somber or
speculative. Some of the newspaper coverage, in fact, has been
almost mythic, like a long piece in The New Vision about the rise
of cults of the Virgin Mary. This included a description of a
Rwandan beauty, Specioza Mukantabona, who had claimed visions of
the Virgin. She was, the article said, disgraced after skeptics
traced her ability to bleed divinely from the mouth to
blood-bloated ticks under her tongue. After that, the paper noted,
``She easily turned into one of the most expensive prostitutes of
modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   The papers have also won some small victories. They questioned
why Uganda's security departments did not realize earlier that the
cult might be a threat. The government has since officially
apologized. And they questioned why most of the exhumation of
corpses has been carried out by prisoners, with bare hands. The
government suspended digging until it could buy gloves and masks.
</P>
<P>
   But Onyango-Obbo, the Monitor editor, has included the press in
his list of those who should shoulder some blame. Because Uganda
has suffered so much abuse at the hands of its government, he said
in an interview, the press has not been well equipped to ask the
probing questions that could help Ugandans understand the
desperation of people who would join a murderous cult and believe
so blindly in its empty promises. ``In this country,'' he said,
``it was always the government committing the crimes. So we didn't
have to do any soul-searching on a personal level.''

IF BIOLOGY IS ANCESTRY, ARE THESE PEOPLE RELATED?

(Repeating) 
 (ATTN: England)   (The Week in Review)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crime scene was bare of clues. Even DNA fingerprinting
scored no hits in the databases. The police had no leads. As a last
resort, they sent a DNA sample to a private company _ which soon
supplied the surname of the man who had left it.
</P>
<P>
   Science fiction as yet, but the company, Oxford Ancestors,
exists and has applied for a patent on the idea of deriving
surnames from DNA. Its founder, Dr. Bryan Sykes, is a geneticist at
the University of Oxford in England who has made an intriguing
discovery about English surnames: many of them once had a single
bearer.
</P>
<P>
   Surnames came into use in England between 1250 and 1450,
probably in connection with the development of inheritable property
rights and trades. ``The surname acted like documentation a time
when they didn't have forms,'' said Dr. George Redmonds, a
historian of place names and surnames. It is not known how many
people took the same surname, but those based on common trades,
like Smith, may have had many original owners.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes, who analyzes DNA to track ancient population changes,
wondered if he could trace the origins of his own surname. The word
comes from a type of moorland stream used to mark land boundaries.
Genealogists expected that as a landscape feature it would have
been adopted by many people in search of surnames. Nearly 10,000
Sykeses are registered as voters in the United Kingdom, many near
the town of Huddersfield in Yorkshire.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sykes sent out letters to a random sample of his male
namesakes, asking them to send him cells brushed from the inside
cheek on a cotton swab. His interest lay in the subjects' Y
chromosomes, which of course are bequeathed from father to son in
the same pattern as surnames, except in the case of what
geneticists delicately refer to as a ``non-paternity event.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other chromosomes, the Y is transmitted unchanged and
would remain identical from the Adams of the human race to all of
their sons, except for the rare mutations or accidental changes
that accumulate over the centuries. Because each lineage of Y
chromosomes carries its own signature set of DNA changes, these
mutations provide a perfect system for tracking male genealogies,
and that is what Sykes looked for in the cotton swabs mailed back
to him.
</P>
<P>
   Only one DNA signature was common among his namesakes' Y
chromosomes, Sykes reports in the current issue of the American
Journal of Human Genetics. This means there was only one original
Mr. Sykes, at least as reflected in today's population. The first
Sykeses on record lived in the 13th century in Flockton,
Slaithwaite and Saddleworth, three villages close to Huddersfield.
</P>
<P>
   Sykeses who do not carry the genetic signature have presumably
had a non-paternity event somewhere in their ancestry. In fact, 50
percent of the modern-day Sykeses did not have the genetic
signature.
</P>
<P>
   Despite appearances, this is a remarkable testimony to the
fidelity of the Mrs. Sykeses of past centuries, because it amounts
to a non-paternity rate of 1.3 percent per generation. The
non-paternity rate in the present English population is conjectured
to be between 2 percent and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   From court records, it seems Dr. Sykes' ancestors, at least in
the 14th century, were ``quite a rough lot _ always being fined for
cutting down trees and stealing sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless,'' Dr. Sykes said, ``their wives were faithful
through all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was a true Sykes or an out-of-wedlock Sykes, he
replied, ``I'm proud to say I have the aboriginal chromosome.''
</P>
<P>
   Sykeses who live in the United States would not necessarily bear
the original chromosome in the same proportion as their English
cousins because the emigrants might not have been a representative
sample, Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   He has analyzed three other surnames in the same way and found
that, as with the Sykeses, all can be traced to a single bearer of
the family name. Even the ubiquitous Smiths and Clarks might trace
their surnames to just a handful of very prolific early ancestors,
not the hundreds that might be presumed, Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests it would be feasible to construct a library of DNA
signatures linked with English family names. The library could be
used forensically to provide a surname that matched a DNA sample,
and for genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Redmonds said that a library of DNA matched to surnames would be
useful in connecting branches of a family that lacked historical
records to document their kinship. The library might be of
particular interest, he said, to Americans of English ancestry
seeking to identify their origins; their Y chromosomes might link
them directly to the villages where the first bearers of their
surnames once lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryan had no interest in genealogy whatsoever before this
started,'' Redmonds said of his geneticist friend. ``When I was
able to take him to the precise place in Yorkshire where his
ancestors came from, he was hooked.''

IF BIOLOGY IS ANCESTRY, ARE THESE PEOPLE RELATED?

<P>
   The crime scene was bare of clues. Even DNA fingerprinting
scored no hits in the databases. The police had no leads. As a last
resort, they sent a DNA sample to a private company _ which soon
supplied the surname of the man who had left it.
</P>
<P>
   Science fiction as yet, but the company, Oxford Ancestors,
exists and has applied for a patent on the idea of deriving
surnames from DNA. Its founder, Dr. Bryan Sykes, is a geneticist at
the University of Oxford in England who has made an intriguing
discovery about English surnames: many of them once had a single
bearer.
</P>
<P>
   Surnames came into use in England between 1250 and 1450,
probably in connection with the development of inheritable property
rights and trades. ``The surname acted like documentation a time
when they didn't have forms,'' said Dr. George Redmonds, a
historian of place names and surnames. It is not known how many
people took the same surname, but those based on common trades,
like Smith, may have had many original owners.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes, who analyzes DNA to track ancient population changes,
wondered if he could trace the origins of his own surname. The word
comes from a type of moorland stream used to mark land boundaries.
Genealogists expected that as a landscape feature it would have
been adopted by many people in search of surnames. Nearly 10,000
Sykeses are registered as voters in the United Kingdom, many near
the town of Huddersfield in Yorkshire.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sykes sent out letters to a random sample of his male
namesakes, asking them to send him cells brushed from the inside
cheek on a cotton swab. His interest lay in the subjects' Y
chromosomes, which of course are bequeathed from father to son in
the same pattern as surnames, except in the case of what
geneticists delicately refer to as a ``non-paternity event.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other chromosomes, the Y is transmitted unchanged and
would remain identical from the Adams of the human race to all of
their sons, except for the rare mutations or accidental changes
that accumulate over the centuries. Because each lineage of Y
chromosomes carries its own signature set of DNA changes, these
mutations provide a perfect system for tracking male genealogies,
and that is what Sykes looked for in the cotton swabs mailed back
to him.
</P>
<P>
   Only one DNA signature was common among his namesakes' Y
chromosomes, Sykes reports in the current issue of the American
Journal of Human Genetics. This means there was only one original
Mr. Sykes, at least as reflected in today's population. The first
Sykeses on record lived in the 13th century in Flockton,
Slaithwaite and Saddleworth, three villages close to Huddersfield.
</P>
<P>
   Sykeses who do not carry the genetic signature have presumably
had a non-paternity event somewhere in their ancestry. In fact, 50
percent of the modern-day Sykeses did not have the genetic
signature.
</P>
<P>
   Despite appearances, this is a remarkable testimony to the
fidelity of the Mrs. Sykeses of past centuries, because it amounts
to a non-paternity rate of 1.3 percent per generation. The
non-paternity rate in the present English population is conjectured
to be between 2 percent and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   From court records, it seems Dr. Sykes' ancestors, at least in
the 14th century, were ``quite a rough lot _ always being fined for
cutting down trees and stealing sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless,'' Dr. Sykes said, ``their wives were faithful
through all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was a true Sykes or an out-of-wedlock Sykes, he
replied, ``I'm proud to say I have the aboriginal chromosome.''
</P>
<P>
   Sykeses who live in the United States would not necessarily bear
the original chromosome in the same proportion as their English
cousins because the emigrants might not have been a representative
sample, Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   He has analyzed three other surnames in the same way and found
that, as with the Sykeses, all can be traced to a single bearer of
the family name. Even the ubiquitous Smiths and Clarks might trace
their surnames to just a handful of very prolific early ancestors,
not the hundreds that might be presumed, Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests it would be feasible to construct a library of DNA
signatures linked with English family names. The library could be
used forensically to provide a surname that matched a DNA sample,
and for genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Redmonds said that a library of DNA matched to surnames would be
useful in connecting branches of a family that lacked historical
records to document their kinship. The library might be of
particular interest, he said, to Americans of English ancestry
seeking to identify their origins; their Y chromosomes might link
them directly to the villages where the first bearers of their
surnames once lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryan had no interest in genealogy whatsoever before this
started,'' Redmonds said of his geneticist friend. ``When I was
able to take him to the precise place in Yorkshire where his
ancestors came from, he was hooked.''

 &HT;    Spring arrives with the pitter patter of little claws
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ It's a sure sign of spring, or that I've had
enough winter, when I catch myself doing odd things like making
backyard chat with a couple of fat squirrels who just happen to be
complaining because their breakfast is late. I remind them they're
living in my trees, rent-free, so maybe they'd better show some
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, by the time I shuffle up to the kitchen sink to
fill the kettle, Albert is doing rodent calisthenics on a limb just
outside the window. He nails me with his beady little eyes.
</P>
<P>
   When I step onto the back porch to change into my yard shoes,
Benjamin (I name them alphabetically) is plastered half-way up the
screen door, clucking and whipping his tail in annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cut me some slack, here,'' I mutter, shoving him out of the
way with the door so I can get out. ``Remember, I'm wise to you
guys. You think I don't know you're only a fuzzy tail away from a
rat?''
</P>
<P>
   Albert clicks his little claws down the side of a favored pine
and joins in the tirade. Now there are two of them protesting. I
remind them I'm bigger than they are and a whole lot smarter.
Benjamin suggests that if I were really as smart as I think I am,
he'd be the one hauling home 40-pound bags of sunflower seeds from
the feed store instead of me.
</P>
<P>
   According to the calendar, winter's gone, but around here that
doesn't mean for sure the birdbath won't freeze up one more time,
or that it's not going to snow all over Miss Maybelle's new Easter
bonnet, but today promises to be warm and sunny.
</P>
<P>
   It's still early enough in the morning for cardinals to be at
the feeders because, as my son once explained, they prefer to feed
in dusky light. Makes it tougher for the neighborhood cats to spot
their vivid red feathers. Sparrows and finches flutter back and
forth, and a nuthatch is hanging upside down from the trunk of
Albert's condo.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of bluejays raucously swap bird jokes. ``Didja hear the
one about the owl and the farmer's daughter?'' They share a shriek.
I can only guess at the punchline.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of mourning doves head-bob their way around the base of
the feeders, unwilling and ill-equipped for the gymnastics of
perching. These guys always seem to be in a bad mood, arguing over
territory and slapping their wings to intimidate, as they flutter
out of each other's way. Makes me wonder how they came to be the
symbol of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't seen the raccoon yet or any of his telltale droppings on
the porch roof, but Biddy knows he's in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Late the other night I was stretched out in the tub, idly
contemplating my big toe sticking up through the bubbles as Biddy,
my Siamese guardian and resident nag, lay on the bathmat dreaming
of catnip mice and laps that never move. A whisker shuddered, then
a paw, and then in one fluid motion she leapt up, let out a banshee
wail, and raced off.
</P>
<P>
   Bedrooms to basement and back she went, summoning guttural
growls from the very pads on her feet. Eyebrows up and tail fur
standing at attention, she was on the third circuit when she
skidded into the bathroom and, due to a slight miscalculation,
landed smack on my chest in a foot of water. She froze and stared _
like it was all my fault.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly fresh out of energy and ideas, she flopped and lay
there, paws awash, tail swishing bubbles onto the tile, and looked
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we sat together on the bathroom floor wrapped in towels
as I attempted to restore her feline dignity. ``It's spring,'' I
explained patting her face dry. ``Even people get goofy.'' She
turned an icy blue stare on me, worked one paw out of her terry
cloth cocoon, and tentatively placed it on my mouth.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect she found the comparison odious.

   WASHINGTON _ He had hoped it would be different. But as the
forms roll in _ or, more accurately, do not roll in _ Kenneth
Prewitt, director of the Census Bureau, is beginning to doubt that
he will meet his twin goals for the 2000 census: persuading 70
percent of Americans to return their forms, and sparking a new wave
of American civic engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we end up at 61 percent, I would give a very good grade to
the Census Bureau,'' Prewitt said last week. ``But not a good grade
_ maybe a C _ for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But is the census a fair measure of the country turning inward?
Or are there other explanations for what appears to be public
apathy toward the decennial head count?
</P>
<P>
   The plummeting response rate to the census over the years _ from
83 percent in 1970, the first year that forms were sent by mail, to
65 percent in 1990 _ parallels a well-documented trend of voter
apathy.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, the purposes and procedures of voting are more clear;
the once-a-decade census is hardly habit-forming. Focus groups
conducted by the Census Bureau found that for most people, the
census is an obscure governmental function that they don't
understand. Nor do they have any sense that it benefits them.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Internet age, when the country is awash in anxiety
about the vulnerability of personal information, the census has
been caught in a web of privacy concerns. A vocal, mostly
conservative contingent has put forth sometimes Orwellian visions
of a government that cannot be trusted with any personal data.
</P>
<P>
   The main target of the criticism is the long form, with its 53
questions covering everything from income to plumbing, although
questions have arisen about the short form as well. About 48
percent of long forms have been returned so far this year, compared
with 57 percent by this time a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Robert
Smith of New Hampshire, a conservative Republican, that vowed
``that no American will be prosecuted, fined or in any way harassed
by the federal government or its agents for failure to respond to
any census questions which refer to an individual's race, national
origin, living conditions, personal habits or mental and/or
physical condition.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that citizens would be hauled into court in any
case. Still, the conservative Southeastern Legal Foundation has
offered to defend anyone prosecuted for such civil disobedience.
Its president, Matt Glavin, does not see the lack of participation
as a civic problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rise of concerns over privacy issues'' over the Internet
``and hackers getting into government and private databases _ that
in and of itself is an indication of civic involvement,'' Glavin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the census were taking place in a more conducive
environment, some scholars of American culture say the bureau would
still have trouble gaining the participation of the public. After
all, return rates for the census had been declining for three
decades, well before concerns about the Internet and privacy had
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Putnam, a professor of public policy at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, places the
unwillingness to fill out census forms alongside the decline in
community bowling leagues, neighborhood bars and, of course, voting
_ all signs that Americans have become more alienated from, and
less caring about, one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big story is not political alienation or worries about
privacy,'' said Putnam, author of the forthcoming book ``Bowling
Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster). ``We attend 60 percent fewer club meetings than we did a
generation ago. We go on 60 percent fewer picnics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that kind of community connectedness that is the
strongest predictor of how people respond to the census,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, officials estimated that 61 percent of households
would return the forms this year. But Prewitt had hoped the the
Census Bureau's $102 million advertising campaign would push the
response rate up to 70 percent. Now that seems unlikely. Given the
trends in American civic life, and the news, it may be more
surprising that the response rate is as high as it is.

READING, WRITING AND RITALIN: FURY, NOT FACTS, OVER CHILD
BEHAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are toddlers being plied with Prozac, Ritalin and other powerful
drugs for behavior problems no more severe than sticking pennies
into the VCR, throwing peas at the dinner table or refusing to go
to bed on time?
</P>
<P>
   The hand-wringing in recent weeks over a study that documented
an acute increase in the prescription of psychiatric medications _
primarily stimulants and antidepressants _ for preschoolers over a
five-year period would suggest just that.
</P>
<P>
   Some mental health professionals have painted young children as
the latest victims of a culture obsessed with syndromes and
disorders. And politicians have seized the opportunity to condemn
the ``overmedicating'' of the nation's youngest citizens. On March
20, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced a major federal initiative to
reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as often happens when science goes to Washington, the
complexities that underlie the study's findings have been slighted
in the public debate.
</P>
<P>
   And while concern over the rise in prescriptions is warranted,
outrage may be premature. In fact, scientists know almost nothing
about the children who are receiving such drugs, or the
circumstances under which the medications are being prescribed. The
study in question, for example, published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, did not analyze information about the
children's diagnoses or the specialties of the physicians who wrote
the prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   What little researchers and clinicians do know suggests that the
increases cannot be solely attributed to reckless prescribing by
doctors hell-bent on tagging a psychiatric label on every child who
walks into the consulting room.
</P>
<P>
   While pressure on parents and the current popularity of
diagnoses like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and
depression undoubtedly play a role, it is also clear that at least
some proportion of very young children taking psychiatric drugs
have severe troubles. And in many cases, the drugs are given as a
last resort, prescribed in the hope of protecting the child's
safety, ensuring the safety of others or offering relief to a
toddler whose life is being swallowed up by symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the general public doesn't understand that we're not
talking about kids who won't stay in the grocery cart,'' said Dr.
Marsha D. Rappley, an associate professor in pediatrics and human
medicine at Michigan State University and the lead investigator in
a smaller 15-month study of medication use in preschoolers with
attention disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about very disturbed behavior,'' Rappley said.
``And these children need help.''
</P>
<P>
   Rappley's study, which tracked 223 children under the age of 3
who were enrolled in a Michigan Medicaid program, has been cited in
the public debate as one more indication that very young children
are being drugged unnecessarily. Yet a closer look at the study,
one of the few to offer clues to who these young pill takers are,
does not entirely bear out that view.
</P>
<P>
   True, Rappley and her colleagues found that 57 percent of the
children were given psychiatric medications. And of that group,
45.7 percent were prescribed more than one drug. In all, 30
combinations of 22 psychiatric medications were observed.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers also found that almost half the preschoolers
in the study suffered from diabetes, asthma or other major chronic
illnesses in addition to the attention disorder. Almost half had
other psychiatric problems, including developmental or language
delays, emotional disturbance and autism. Five percent were victims
of child abuse or other traumas. And 40 percent were treated for an
injury during the study period, 12 percent on more than one
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cannot really be dismissed as bad behavior on the part of
doctors who want to medicate children,'' Dr. Rappley said. ``It is
not that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter S. Jensen, director of the Center for the Advancement
of Children's Mental Health at the New York State Psychiatric
Institute, said the level of severity found in the Michigan study
meshed with his own experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most parents are terribly frightened and loath to put a child
on medication, and it's the kind of thing they would do when
everything else has been tried,'' said Jensen, who added that
medication is usually combined with behavior therapy or parenting
advice. In one case he recalled, a 3-year-old showed an escalating
pattern of severe aggression, eventually wounding another child in
his day-care center with a butter knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that 6 to 9 percent of older kids have severe
emotional disturbances,'' Jensen said. ``Do we think it happens out
of the brow of Zeus? Where were these kids at the age of 3 or 4 or
5? To my mind, the crime is not that these children are being put
on medicine, but that we don't have the data to know what we are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, scientists' ignorance is at the core of the problem.
Investigators have no idea, for example, how prevalent severe
mental disorders are among the very young, what the best ways to
treat such illnesses might be or which children are most
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-KIDS-PSYCHODRUGS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: most vulnerable. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And even when doctors prescribe medication in a last-ditch
attempt to help a very disturbed child, they are operating in a
data vacuum: little or nothing is known about the effects of
psychiatric drugs on the developing brain or the long-term impact
on social relations, academic achievement or personality in young
children who take such drugs. And most of the medications have not
been specifically tested or had their dosages calibrated for young
children.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Julie Magno Zito, an associate professor of pharmacy and
medicine at the University of Maryland and the lead author of the
recent journal study, commented when asked about the prescription
increases: ``We don't have any benchmarks to know if this is or is
not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the line between normality and clinical illness in
a 3-year-old is rarely clearly defined. Dr. Alison Gopnik, a
developmental psychologist at the University of California at
Berkeley, said many aspects of behavior _ like impulse control, the
ability to focus and empathy _ vary greatly from child to child,
and develop at different ages.
</P>
<P>
   Gopnik said she was disturbed by ``the idea of doing this in
preschoolers, where the medical evidence isn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think parents always have a good idea of what just
normal preschooler behavior is,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Gopnik said, there is a ``mismatch between what
children are like just as children, what schools require from
children and the time and energy parents have to negotiate that
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists still know little, if anything, about diagnosing
specific mental disorders in preschoolers. Studies indicate that
such diagnoses are often fluid, changing as the child grows older,
though severe behavior problems often persist.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of hard data, few experts would dispute that the
sharp increase in prescriptions for toddlers is disturbing,
particularly over so brief a period. Nor would most deny that the
trend raises larger social and ethical questions. Zito, for
example, said that at some point, society must decide how far down
the age scale the medical model, which relies on diagnoses of
illness and is likely to see drugs as the appropriate treatment,
should be extended. ``We are generalizing from adults to school-age
children, and now from school-age children to very young
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, a former associate director for child and adolescent
research at the National Institute of Mental Health, said the
federal government shares much of the blame for the dearth of
knowledge about how to evaluate the use of drugs. Federal agencies,
he said, have not yet provided high levels of research funding to
study children's mental health.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. Responding to the outcry over Zito's
study, the National Institute of Mental Health said it would spend
$6 million over the next five years to study whether Ritalin is
safe and effective for children under 6. And the White House is
planning a conference next fall on mental illness in preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, scientists may learn whether the increase in drug
prescriptions charted by Zito and her colleagues represent
overmedication or appropriate _ in some cases, lifesaving _
treatment for young children.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage is easy; it is harder, and more expensive, to find real
answers.

READING, WRITING AND RITALIN: FURY, NOT FACTS, OVER CHILD
BEHAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are toddlers being plied with Prozac, Ritalin and other powerful
drugs for behavior problems no more severe than sticking pennies
into the VCR, throwing peas at the dinner table or refusing to go
to bed on time?
</P>
<P>
   The hand-wringing in recent weeks over a study that documented
an acute increase in the prescription of psychiatric medications _
primarily stimulants and antidepressants _ for preschoolers over a
five-year period would suggest just that.
</P>
<P>
   Some mental health professionals have painted young children as
the latest victims of a culture obsessed with syndromes and
disorders. And politicians have seized the opportunity to condemn
the ``overmedicating'' of the nation's youngest citizens. On March
20, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced a major federal initiative to
reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as often happens when science goes to Washington, the
complexities that underlie the study's findings have been slighted
in the public debate.
</P>
<P>
   And while concern over the rise in prescriptions is warranted,
outrage may be premature. In fact, scientists know almost nothing
about the children who are receiving such drugs, or the
circumstances under which the medications are being prescribed. The
study in question, for example, published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, did not analyze information about the
children's diagnoses or the specialties of the physicians who wrote
the prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   What little researchers and clinicians do know suggests that the
increases cannot be solely attributed to reckless prescribing by
doctors hell-bent on tagging a psychiatric label on every child who
walks into the consulting room.
</P>
<P>
   While pressure on parents and the current popularity of
diagnoses like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and
depression undoubtedly play a role, it is also clear that at least
some proportion of very young children taking psychiatric drugs
have severe troubles. And in many cases, the drugs are given as a
last resort, prescribed in the hope of protecting the child's
safety, ensuring the safety of others or offering relief to a
toddler whose life is being swallowed up by symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the general public doesn't understand that we're not
talking about kids who won't stay in the grocery cart,'' said Dr.
Marsha D. Rappley, an associate professor in pediatrics and human
medicine at Michigan State University and the lead investigator in
a smaller 15-month study of medication use in preschoolers with
attention disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about very disturbed behavior,'' Rappley said.
``And these children need help.''
</P>
<P>
   Rappley's study, which tracked 223 children under the age of 3
who were enrolled in a Michigan Medicaid program, has been cited in
the public debate as one more indication that very young children
are being drugged unnecessarily. Yet a closer look at the study,
one of the few to offer clues to who these young pill takers are,
does not entirely bear out that view.
</P>
<P>
   True, Rappley and her colleagues found that 57 percent of the
children were given psychiatric medications. And of that group,
45.7 percent were prescribed more than one drug. In all, 30
combinations of 22 psychiatric medications were observed.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers also found that almost half the preschoolers
in the study suffered from diabetes, asthma or other major chronic
illnesses in addition to the attention disorder. Almost half had
other psychiatric problems, including developmental or language
delays, emotional disturbance and autism. Five percent were victims
of child abuse or other traumas. And 40 percent were treated for an
injury during the study period, 12 percent on more than one
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cannot really be dismissed as bad behavior on the part of
doctors who want to medicate children,'' Dr. Rappley said. ``It is
not that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter S. Jensen, director of the Center for the Advancement
of Children's Mental Health at the New York State Psychiatric
Institute, said the level of severity found in the Michigan study
meshed with his own experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most parents are terribly frightened and loath to put a child
on medication, and it's the kind of thing they would do when
everything else has been tried,'' said Jensen, who added that
medication is usually combined with behavior therapy or parenting
advice. In one case he recalled, a 3-year-old showed an escalating
pattern of severe aggression, eventually wounding another child in
his day-care center with a butter knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that 6 to 9 percent of older kids have severe
emotional disturbances,'' Jensen said. ``Do we think it happens out
of the brow of Zeus? Where were these kids at the age of 3 or 4 or
5? To my mind, the crime is not that these children are being put
on medicine, but that we don't have the data to know what we are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, scientists' ignorance is at the core of the problem.
Investigators have no idea, for example, how prevalent severe
mental disorders are among the very young, what the best ways to
treat such illnesses might be or which children are most
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-KIDS-PSYCHODRUGS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: most vulnerable. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And even when doctors prescribe medication in a last-ditch
attempt to help a very disturbed child, they are operating in a
data vacuum: little or nothing is known about the effects of
psychiatric drugs on the developing brain or the long-term impact
on social relations, academic achievement or personality in young
children who take such drugs. And most of the medications have not
been specifically tested or had their dosages calibrated for young
children.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Julie Magno Zito, an associate professor of pharmacy and
medicine at the University of Maryland and the lead author of the
recent journal study, commented when asked about the prescription
increases: ``We don't have any benchmarks to know if this is or is
not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the line between normality and clinical illness in
a 3-year-old is rarely clearly defined. Dr. Alison Gopnik, a
developmental psychologist at the University of California at
Berkeley, said many aspects of behavior _ like impulse control, the
ability to focus and empathy _ vary greatly from child to child,
and develop at different ages.
</P>
<P>
   Gopnik said she was disturbed by ``the idea of doing this in
preschoolers, where the medical evidence isn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think parents always have a good idea of what just
normal preschooler behavior is,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Gopnik said, there is a ``mismatch between what
children are like just as children, what schools require from
children and the time and energy parents have to negotiate that
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists still know little, if anything, about diagnosing
specific mental disorders in preschoolers. Studies indicate that
such diagnoses are often fluid, changing as the child grows older,
though severe behavior problems often persist.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of hard data, few experts would dispute that the
sharp increase in prescriptions for toddlers is disturbing,
particularly over so brief a period. Nor would most deny that the
trend raises larger social and ethical questions. Zito, for
example, said that at some point, society must decide how far down
the age scale the medical model, which relies on diagnoses of
illness and is likely to see drugs as the appropriate treatment,
should be extended. ``We are generalizing from adults to school-age
children, and now from school-age children to very young
children.''

 &HT;    Take pick of browsers
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   If I continue to use AOL as my Internet service provider, do I
also need a browser like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer?
Can't AOL get me to the Web?
</P>
<P>
   _Judith Kohlberg,
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: AOL can do it all, including providing your Web browser.
On the flip side, you're not stuck with using AOL's browser either.
Download a free one off the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Once you've logged into AOL, you can launch the Web browser
of your choice, then surf to your heart's content.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   If I were to switch from my ISP, can I keep the same e-mail
address? I hesitate to switch because I could potentially lose
touch with people who have my existing address. What's the best way
to handle that?
</P>
<P>
   _Joseph Goldstein
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Sorry, Joe, no can do. Your e-mail address must change.
If you switch ISPs, the domain (name(at)domain) will be different.
Why? Well, it's like you're moving to another state and your
address changes. For instance, if your address is
jgoldstein(at)compuserv.com and you're moving to bluelight.com, the
new address could be jgoldstein(at)bluelight.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It's important to note that more than the domain name may
change. Someone else using bluelight.com already may have glommed
onto jgoldstein. Be prepared to be creative when picking the name
part of your address. Or, a way to guarantee you'll never have to
change your e-mail address again, if you switch ISPs, is to sign up
for free e-mail with Yahoo or HotMail, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If you're afraid of losing touch with buddies and
business contacts, run both accounts parallel for a bit. That way,
you can let people know your new address before stopping your old
service.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I want to create a family Web site where I can place
genealogical history (family tree), pictures and stories of family
members. I don't want to share this outside our family. Suggestions
for a Web site?
</P>
<P>
   _Brandt Ross
</P>
<P>
   Sue: This might fit the bill. Go to www.MyFamily.com. My Uncle
Larry and Aunt Barb, who are jazzed about genealogy, pegged this
site for our family.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: I dug the free site's features. In addition to building
an online family tree, you can post family photos, anecdotes and
recipes. A log-on process offers the security you're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The site is jam-packed with possibilities. Calendaring.
E-mail. Addresses. Chat. You name it, they've got it. I just came
across something cool on that site called the Family Store. Set up
your own mom-and-pop business and sell products.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Great commercial, Sue. For comparison shopping, browse
over to www.genealogy.com or www.familytree.com.
</P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.)

 &HT;    Surprise, surprise! Framework is alive and runs on Windows
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those FBI agents on television who are always assuring
us that ``the truth is out there'' are quite right, you know. All I
need to do is express befuddlement over some issue or get something
wrong, and the truth comes flying through the transom.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it comes in like a school of wet mackerels and other
times on the gentle wings of a dove, but believe me, somebody out
there always has the truth.
</P>
<P>
   And I appreciate knowing it. I can do without the ``you imbecile
...'' openings, but it's good to have the right info and to pass it
on to those who were searching for it in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   A very kind gentleman named Charles Fuller responded to my
nostalgic ruminations about the old DOS multifunction program
Framework and the obstinate fellow who was running it in preference
to Windows. Fuller's reply, and the URL he sent along, was for me
rather like discovering an entire tribe of living Neanderthals _
all busily conversing in HTML and keeping track of their mammoth
hides in spreadsheets.
</P>
<P>
   Framework lives.
</P>
<P>
   My original correspondent had wondered whether he could copy his
old Framework program into a newer computer and run it under DOS. I
still can't answer that definitively. However, if he will go to his
modern computer and point his Internet browser to www
.framework.com, he'll be amazed.
</P>
<P>
   This one-time Ashton-Tate, then Borland product, long believed
(at least by me) extinct, is alive and well and in its sixth
iteration under the aegis of a firm called Selections &AMP; Functions.
It is still DOS-based, but it runs with any version of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher says its ``unified outline windowing environment
includes word processing, spreadsheets, databases and HTML tables,
file and directory management, data management, codeless hypertext,
text-based interpreter and rapid development computer language.''
</P>
<P>
   It is available in a number of special-purpose versions,
including one for the visually impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``While compatible with Windows 95, 98 and NT,'' its publishers
continue, ``Framework is a DOS application, giving it a significant
speed advantage over Windows applications as well as the ability to
run without Windows altogether. Framework graphic output allows it
to run both in a window under Windows and in full-screen-graphic
mode using its own fonts.''
</P>
<P>
   Astonishing, no? Consider the cultural and anthropological
implications. What would some modern young information technology
specialist think if he took a seat on the 9 a.m. train from the
suburbs next to an old guy running a fancy new IBM laptop, looked
over and saw Framework on the screen? He'd probably report it to
Scully and Mulder.

 &HT;    Forget the gizmos, just give me some old-fashioned technology
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My brother called a few moments ago. He's a small-town
physician, and I'm a blue-collar newspaperman. We love each other
but _ since we are so different _ we end up scrambling to find a
conversation sometimes. He asked me, as he usually does, ``What's
new and exciting with technology?''
</P>
<P>
   I keep up pretty well. And I know the stock answers, I know what
the buzz is, but this was my brother, not some speech I was making.
</P>
<P>
   I realized that very few of the new things that excite the real
experts do much for me. For instance, there's wireless Web use.
Gosh, I'd rather play golf than walk down the golf course,
exchanging e-mails while trying to make up an excuse for why my
drive killed a golf course goose.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's MP3, downloading music files and playing them on
one of the tiny little music machines. My CD player is easier.
Besides, the music available online is either pirated copies of
commercial songs or tunes by groups that seem to have names like
``Too Stupid to Die.'' I'd rather listen to Peggy Lee.
</P>
<P>
   New computers ... well, there are always new computers, and they
are always faster and have more nifty features. But most of them
boil down to beige-colored boxes that tend to mess up at the most
inconvenient times.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the technology companies are almost desperate
to find some world-killer application or device these days. Instead
of worrying about what the world needs, they're more concerned with
what they can do, what they can invent, not what people need.
</P>
<P>
   I get a lot of e-mail, get a lot of calls and talking to real
people _ the consumers who are made to feel almost inadequate
because they don't have Palm Pilots, cable modems or 1-gigahertz
PCs _ helps me tune out some of the hysteria that I read and hear.
Because of the e-mail, I get to talk to the real experts, the
people who would rather pay the mortgage than own a PC powerful
enough to run an astrophysics research program, who use Walkmans
instead of MP3 players, and who are just now getting fast telephone
modems and live in places where cable modems and DSL _ the
telephone company's high-speed data service _ is either unavailable
or not worth the money for ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   But I had to tell my brother something and _ being desperate _ I
told him the truth.
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm impressed by fairly mundane gadgets that are making a real
difference in people's lives. And so are many of my readers.
Instead of raving about MP3, they tell me that WebTV _ that simple
gadget that turns your TV set into an Internet machine _ has let
them join the world of cyberspace, let them send e-mail and browse
the Web without confusing them.
</P>
<P>
   _ The regular cell phone is also becoming as much a part of life
as the regular telephone and the TV. Rates have dropped to where
ordinary people can have one, and it's become a reliable lifeline
on lonely drives, an easy way to summon help. And with today's rate
plans, which often include free long-distance service, it's become
more than an auxiliary telephone. It's become the way a lot of us
call our family and friends, using that free long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   _ E-mail, that techno-dinosaur of the Internet that dates to the
days when the name World Wide Web sounded like a comic strip title,
has reinvented the art of personal correspondence. People are
writing again. And, maybe it's just my bias, but I think that it's
bringing back the art of the conversation. Sure, we've swapped
rocking chairs on the front porch for computers in the spare
bedroom, and that's not as warm and good, but it sure beats
watching prime-time TV alone.
</P>
<P>
   So what's new and exciting in technology? It's the old stuff.
And it's the truth.

MICROSOFT AND THE NEW MATH OF MONOPOLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scorecard in the Microsoft case, according to Attorney
General Janet Reno, is simple: Microsoft lost and America's
consumers won.
</P>
<P>
   After a federal judge ruled last week that Microsoft was a
monopolistic predator that had repeatedly violated the nation's
antitrust laws, Reno declared, ``Thanks to this ruling, consumers
who have been harmed can now look forward to benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, the Justice Department and 19 states who sued Microsoft
will propose to the court what sanctions should be taken against
the company. Before that happens, however, consider how consumers
and the computing world have fared since 1995, when the government
case against Microsoft began.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a personal computer has dropped sharply,
while PCs have grown more powerful and versatile. The industry has
generated growth, jobs and wealth _ even created, some say, a New
Economy that is the envy of other nations.
</P>
<P>
   So why  &UR; was &LR;  this costly and sweeping antitrust suit filed
against Microsoft nearly two years ago? The answer, according to
the government and many antitrust experts, is twofold: to enforce
the law and to support innovation.
</P>
<P>
   That is a new rationale for antitrust action, one adapted to the
New Economy. In the Standard Oil era, monopoly-busting was about
price-fixing. Now, the government claims, monopolies constrain
technological change. So the Microsoft case marks what may be an
important step in how government and the courts deal with the
Internet economy in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional half of the government case was simply a litany
of anti-competitive practices: that Microsoft illegally tied its
Internet browser to its industry-standard Windows operating system,
and then used exclusionary contracts and threats to force computer
makers and Internet service providers to shun the products of
rivals like Netscape Communications, the pioneer in Internet
browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   It was the economic theory underpinning the government's case
that was novel. That theory leaned heavily on new thinking about
how modern high-technology markets work. In traditional antitrust
cases, high prices typically signal a gouging monopolist. There
was, in fact, evidence presented that the price of Windows, which
runs the basic operations of nearly 90 percent of PCs, would be
lower if the company had competition. And industry analysts
estimate that the pretax profit on Microsoft's Windows business is
an astronomical 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Windows accounts for only about 5 percent of the total
price of most PCs sold today. So even if Windows prices are
slightly higher than they should be, it is not something that
consumers would notice. (Microsoft said it raised prices on Windows
because it has added all kinds of features in recent years.)
</P>
<P>
   But price seems a less reliable signal of monopolistic abuse
than it would be with, say, an oil producer or steel maker, because
the cost of producing copies of a software program is virtually
zero. Microsoft merely licenses its computer code to PC makers, who
then install it. Whether Microsoft sells 100 million or 200 million
copies, its costs are all in developing the code to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ground rules have changed economically in cases like this
and we realized that in bringing the Microsoft case,'' said Daniel
Rubinfeld, the chief economist of the Justice Department's
antitrust division until the end of 1998. ``And innovation, much
more than price, is what the Microsoft case is about.''
</P>
<P>
   The new economics of software, according to the government, mean
a dominant company like Microsoft can shape innovation and curb
competition with a new weapon _ its technology standard. Windows is
the gateway through which all the hardware and software used in the
vast majority of personal computers must pass. Microsoft, the
government charged, denied rivals early access to its technology,
while rewarding its industry friends with cooperation. That raised
the barrier to entry, in cost and difficulty, to challengers.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft case, according to Rubinfeld, now a professor at
the University of California at Berkeley, marks the beginning of a
growing debate over government policy in markets that rely on
innovation, software and the Internet. These markets, he said, tend
to naturally evolve toward one or two dominant companies (think
Cisco in routers for Internet data or eBay in online auctions).
They control the technology standards in their markets. What
balance should be struck between protecting their intellectual
property and insuring that newcomers get a fair chance to compete?
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of policy,'' said Robert E. Hall, an economist at
Stanford University, ``is to make sure you hold the door open to
the next Netscape, to new entrants who bring innovation to the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the evidence in the antitrust case, Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson found last week that ``Microsoft mounted a
deliberate assault on entrepreneurial efforts that, left to rise or
fall on their own merits, could well have enabled the introduction
of competition'' to Microsoft's markets.
</P>
<P>
   In his fact-finding document last November, Jackson concluded
with an impassioned embrace of the innovation theory of consumer
harm. At the end of more than 200 pages examining Microsoft and its
conduct, he wrote, ``The ultimate result is that some innovations
that would truly benefit consumers never occur for the sole reason
that they do not coincide with Microsoft's self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R &LR; - &UR; MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: Microsoft's self-interest.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft plans to appeal Jackson's ruling, and the company's
chairman, Bill Gates, bridles at its damning depiction of his
company. ``This ruling turns on its head the reality that consumers
know: that our software has helped make PCs accessible and more
affordable to millions of Americans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists that the very acts the government claimed were
anti-competitive, like folding browsing software into Windows,
resulted in bringing the Internet to the PC-using masses. That was
real innovation, Microsoft believes, which deserves praise, not
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to speculate how things might have turned out
had Microsoft not, in Jackson's phrase, placed ``its oppressive
thumb on the scale of competitive fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   The most rapid innovation and most venture-capital investment in
recent years, experts note, have been in Internet computing,
outside Microsoft's stronghold in the personal computer business.
Innovation in Internet software, they note, might have gone even
faster had Microsoft's actions not hobbled Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   In the PC industry, they add, the most innovative company
recently has been the reinvigorated Apple Computer since its
cofounder Steven P. Jobs returned and took over in 1997. Again,
Apple is largely outside Microsoft's control because it uses its
own Macintosh operating system, instead of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hypothetical, but the argument is that sure things are
great in the high-tech economy, but they might have been even
better,'' observed David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard
Business School. ``All these things on the Internet would have
happened anyway, but they would have happened faster and the
quality would have been better without Microsoft's anti-competitive
acts.''

MICROSOFT AND THE NEW MATH OF MONOPOLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scorecard in the Microsoft case, according to Attorney
General Janet Reno, is simple: Microsoft lost and America's
consumers won.
</P>
<P>
   After a federal judge ruled last week that Microsoft was a
monopolistic predator that had repeatedly violated the nation's
antitrust laws, Reno declared, ``Thanks to this ruling, consumers
who have been harmed can now look forward to benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, the Justice Department and 19 states who sued Microsoft
will propose to the court what sanctions should be taken against
the company. Before that happens, however, consider how consumers
and the computing world have fared since 1995, when the government
case against Microsoft began.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a personal computer has dropped sharply,
while PCs have grown more powerful and versatile. The industry has
generated growth, jobs and wealth _ even created, some say, a New
Economy that is the envy of other nations.
</P>
<P>
   So why  &UR; was &LR;  this costly and sweeping antitrust suit filed
against Microsoft nearly two years ago? The answer, according to
the government and many antitrust experts, is twofold: to enforce
the law and to support innovation.
</P>
<P>
   That is a new rationale for antitrust action, one adapted to the
New Economy. In the Standard Oil era, monopoly-busting was about
price-fixing. Now, the government claims, monopolies constrain
technological change. So the Microsoft case marks what may be an
important step in how government and the courts deal with the
Internet economy in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional half of the government case was simply a litany
of anti-competitive practices: that Microsoft illegally tied its
Internet browser to its industry-standard Windows operating system,
and then used exclusionary contracts and threats to force computer
makers and Internet service providers to shun the products of
rivals like Netscape Communications, the pioneer in Internet
browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   It was the economic theory underpinning the government's case
that was novel. That theory leaned heavily on new thinking about
how modern high-technology markets work. In traditional antitrust
cases, high prices typically signal a gouging monopolist. There
was, in fact, evidence presented that the price of Windows, which
runs the basic operations of nearly 90 percent of PCs, would be
lower if the company had competition. And industry analysts
estimate that the pretax profit on Microsoft's Windows business is
an astronomical 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Windows accounts for only about 5 percent of the total
price of most PCs sold today. So even if Windows prices are
slightly higher than they should be, it is not something that
consumers would notice. (Microsoft said it raised prices on Windows
because it has added all kinds of features in recent years.)
</P>
<P>
   But price seems a less reliable signal of monopolistic abuse
than it would be with, say, an oil producer or steel maker, because
the cost of producing copies of a software program is virtually
zero. Microsoft merely licenses its computer code to PC makers, who
then install it. Whether Microsoft sells 100 million or 200 million
copies, its costs are all in developing the code to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ground rules have changed economically in cases like this
and we realized that in bringing the Microsoft case,'' said Daniel
Rubinfeld, the chief economist of the Justice Department's
antitrust division until the end of 1998. ``And innovation, much
more than price, is what the Microsoft case is about.''
</P>

 &HT;    Easter sites brimming with information
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Easter is a holiday that _ just as is true for
Christmas _ has both a deep religious meaning and also has become a
day for games and family activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Web offers information and guidance for both. So no matter
how your family celebrates the day, you should be able to find
something helpful. Unlike the Easter eggs hidden deep in the far
bushes, these sites are easy to find and use.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop on the Bunny Trail is a site called Eggs-otic
Easter. You'll find the site at
www.invision.net/easter/easterinside.html. If you'd like to share
your feelings about the day, there's a place where you can leave a
note for all the world to see. You'll find links that take you to
an Internet Easter egg hunt so, even if it rains on Easter, you can
still find eggs. Plus, there's a way to color Easter eggs online _
no mess, no fuss, all thanks to computer wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   No holiday worth its salt, or flour and sugar, is complete
without special meals, and that's certainly true of Easter. No
matter whether you celebrate the day with a fancy baked ham or a
backyard cookout while the kids hunt for eggs, there's help
available with holiday recipes.
</P>
<P>
   You'll want to check out a site at
holidayrecipe.com/features/easter.asp called Holidayrecipe.com
Easter Recipes for some good cooking ideas. Besides the expected
ham recipes, you'll find some advice on creating your own Easter
baskets from scratch and then even more help on preparing goodies
to fill them. Even the humble boiled egg gets some attention here.
</P>
<P>
   The page also offers you a way to share your own recipes. You'll
be glad to know there's some advice on what to do with the leftover
ham.
</P>
<P>
   For a look at the Christian celebration of Easter, there is a
page at www.gospelcom.net/peggiesplace/easter.htm called Christian
Easter Celebration that is worth a visit. Another site at
www.rockies.net/(tilde)spirit/sermons/easterpage.html offers
information for ministers on the holiday, along with help in
planning sermons.
</P>
<P>
   If you realize, as you began to discuss the holiday with your
family, there are parts of the tradition and history that are still
mysteries to you, there's an excellent resource at
www.geocities.com/Athens/Parthenon/1502/easte.html. It's called
Christine O'Keeffe's Easter page. You'll find links that take you
to sections explaining the egg's importance to the holiday, as well
as sections with traditional Easter games (including hiding the
eggs) and ancient history of the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   This page also has an excellent collection of links to Easter
pages on other parts of the Web. So you'll want to spend some time
investigating these pages as well.
</P>
<P>
   Another traditional Christian page, called Carolyn's Universe,
has some truly beautiful religious graphics as well as sections
that offer the traditional Christian story of Easter, plus
information on the Easter lily, Easter eggs and the Easter bunny.
One story that may not be familiar to all is the story of the
butterfly. That legend compares the metamorphosis of the
caterpillar into the butterfly to the stages of Christ's life.
You'll find Carolyn's Universe at
www.carolynsuniverse.com/easter.html.

 &HT;    CDNow is struggling, and I hope it survives
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first CD I ever bought over the Internet was from
CDNow, an online retailer now, sadly, on the skids.
</P>
<P>
   It was recommended to me by a co-worker who happened to know the
two brothers, Jason and Matthew Olim, who founded the company.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow was a wonderful source of online music launched by these
two music lovers who were frustrated by music store clerks and
often-dismal selections in the brick-and-mortar superstores like
Tower Records.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow was _ and still is _ a great place to find music from that
obscure Celtic rock band you've been hearing about or to track down
the latest techno, blues or other favorites average retailers don't
stock.
</P>
<P>
   The site is also a great source for all kinds of music, for all
kinds of tastes. Users can even make their own CDs from a selection
of music the company provides. Prices can run a little high
sometimes, but if you absolutely, positively must have your
favorite CD from your favorite artist, it's a Web site worth
checking out.
</P>
<P>
   But late last week, word went out that CDNow is in some serious
financial trouble. Shares took a big tumble to a record low of
$3.41, after the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen expressed
concerns. CDNow's shortage of working capital, losses from
operations and significant payments due this year for marketing
agreements raised a flag with the accounting company.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow says it has enough cash on hand to meet its obligations,
and that it has retained an investment banking firm to explore
options _ such as a possible sale or additional financing
arrangements. One potential merger with the Columbia House music
club fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   In the investor relations section of the CDNow site _
considerably off the beaten path before the financial woes became
public _ the company insists it has plenty of cash and plenty of
options.
</P>
<P>
   For people who love music and who love the myriad unique options
the Web provides, CDNow's troubles are worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   Just last January, the Olim brothers wrote a book documenting
their success called ``The CDNow Story: Rags to Riches on the
Internet'' with the subtitle ``How two kids in a basement grabbed
the online music business.''
</P>
<P>
   But what a difference a year makes. CDNow, the online music
store that could find anything for anybody, now must find its own
way. It faces stiff competition not just from online retailing
behemoth Amazon.com but from a variety of online record stores
including brick-and-mortar stalwarts Tower Records and the Virgin
Megastores. Truly savvy surfers can even navigate to sites all
around the world and come up with Brazilian, French or Israeli
music they can't find at their local store.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow has become the virtual ``shop around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   The small music store that features variety is in danger of
losing everything, at least partly because the big superstores like
Amazon and Tower, latecomers, are bigger, cheaper and armed with
slicker technology to make the shopping experience easy and
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Things like this happen in the real world all the time. Small,
friendly neighborhood bookstores get put out of business by the
superstore that sets up shop down the street. Small, family-owned
record companies can't compete with the volume discounts and miles
of floor space in the huge record stores. Now, with digital
download technology, some music fans aren't buying music from CDNow
or anybody else. They're downloading free MP3 files from sites like
MP3.com or Napster.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow has 3.2 million customers, a great TV ad campaign and many
of Amazon's technology gizmos. Sometimes their prices are as good
as or better than Amazon's.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company has lost $174.3 million. That's nowhere
near what Amazon.com loses in just one year, but CDNow is a less
prominent company that has never been able to explain its losses
with Amazon's finesse and conviction.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow is still very much in business, and, with a little luck,
they won't be the casualty of the great Internet shakeout pundits
and analysts have been predicting. (Grocery site Peapod.com and
health site DrKoop.com face similar situations.)
</P>
<P>
   Should CDNow get the cash infusion it needs to keep going,
hopefully it will develop a business strategy to stay up and
running for the benefit of lovers of special music, like founder
Olim, who just wanted his Miles Davis CDs.

 &HT;    Find something or everything about nothing
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the great things about the Internet is that it
eliminates the need for know-it-alls.
</P>
<P>
   Curious about which Monkee's mother invented Liquid Paper? Don't
ask the guy three desks down, who does nothing but work and watch
cable television. Just check the Web and find out about this
not-so-famous mother.
</P>
<P>
   One site in particular, www.bigwaste.com, is a virtual Wal-Mart
of seemingly worthless information.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Waste of Space Collection of Factoids,
www.bigwaste.com/library/factoids/, should be bookmarked for anyone
seeking answers to anything about nothing in particular. ``The
factoids are tidbits of information I pick up from here or there,
which take up valuable space in my brain _ space which could be
used to substantiate my value in society or to augment the quality
of humanity itself, but instead is foolishly and continuously
consumed with inutile knowledge,'' writes Wesley Treat in the
introduction. ``I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of the factoids. (Accuracy is not vouched for.)
</P>
<P>
   _ The typo-correction fluid Liquid Paper was invented by the
mother of Michael Nesmith, Monkees guitarist.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the summer of 1959, the U.S. Postal Service experimented
with the delivery of letters by guided missile.
</P>
<P>
   _ The world's first land speed record was set by an electric car
at 39 mph.
</P>
<P>
   _ George Washington's dentures weren't, as legend supposes, made
of wood, but were fashioned from hippopotamus tusk.
</P>
<P>
   _ There exists a makeshift, one-hoop basketball court inside the
peak of Disneyland's Matterhorn.
</P>
<P>
   _ From 1942 to 1945, car 3544 of the Orient Express was employed
as a French brothel.
</P>
<P>
   _ The semicolon, as it appears in English today, was used by the
ancient Greeks as a question mark.
</P>
<P>
   _ Giraffes have no vocal cords.
</P>
<P>
   _ The salt contained in all of the world's oceans could cover
the United States in a layer a mile and a half thick.
</P>
<P>
   _ The perpetually popular children's clay substance Play-Doh is
the result of an attempt to create a cleaning product for
wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the entire length of the film ``Casablanca,'' no one ever
says the words ``Play it again, Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   A TRIP TO DISNEY FAN LAND
</P>
<P>
   Wonder what all those Disney fanatics do when they're away from
the place? One Web site, laughingplace.com, gives you a good idea.
Almost makes you want to take the question back.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes updated Disney news, links to other sites,
trivia questions and opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week, the site's news section included links to an
Orlando Sentinel story about some Disney employees' confusion
regarding the new mustache policy, which allows them to be worn,
just not grown, at work.
</P>
<P>
   Another link is to an interview with Alan Thompson Jr., half of
the (Rod) Miller &AMP; Thompson duo playing ragtime duets at Disneyland
on Friday and Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   For those who care, here's the origin, for posterity, of how
they met:
</P>
<P>
   ``One day when I was at Disneyland with my marching band, I came
by the piano and asked Rod to play the `Maple Leaf Rag.' He played
it for me, and I couldn't believe how fast he could play. I doubted
I would ever be able to play like that but knew right away I had to
learn how. A couple weeks later, I came back and asked him to teach
me to play ragtime. He said, `I'm not going to teach you because I
don't teach any piano.' He told me it takes a lot of commitment and
a lot of practice, four to six hours a day. I kept bugging him for
three months. Meanwhile, I worked on improving my own ragtime
music. Impressed by my progress, he finally said `yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   A Disneyland update from the previous week was still available,
complete with an overhead photograph of Disney's California
Adventure and pictures of the Golden Gate bridge replica under
construction, the new entrance and exit turnstiles, and other
construction photos.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes discussion boards. A person with the
screen name of Tron182 was discussing the new ``Walt Disney World
Racing'' game for PlayStation last week. Tycoon11 was spending his
free time comparing Disneyland with the Magic Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll asked, ``How often do you visit a Disney theme
park?''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 163 reported respondents, 49 percent visited more than
four times a year and 45 percent came about three times but none
chose ``never.''

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   If I continue to use AOL as my Internet service provider, do I
also need a browser like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer?
Can't AOL get me to the Web?
</P>
<P>
   _Judith Kohlberg,
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: AOL can do it all, including providing your Web browser.
On the flip side, you're not stuck with using AOL's browser either.
Download a free one off the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Once you've logged into AOL, you can launch the Web browser
of your choice, then surf to your heart's content.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   If I were to switch from my ISP, can I keep the same e-mail
address? I hesitate to switch because I could potentially lose
touch with people who have my existing address. What's the best way
to handle that?
</P>
<P>
   _Joseph Goldstein
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Sorry, Joe, no can do. Your e-mail address must change.
If you switch ISPs, the domain (name(at)domain) will be different.
Why? Well, it's like you're moving to another state and your
address changes. For instance, if your address is
jgoldstein(at)compuserv.com and you're moving to bluelight.com, the
new address could be jgoldstein(at)bluelight.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It's important to note that more than the domain name may
change. Someone else using bluelight.com already may have glommed
onto jgoldstein. Be prepared to be creative when picking the name
part of your address. Or, a way to guarantee you'll never have to
change your e-mail address again, if you switch ISPs, is to sign up
for free e-mail with Yahoo or HotMail, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If you're afraid of losing touch with buddies and
business contacts, run both accounts parallel for a bit. That way,
you can let people know your new address before stopping your old
service.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I want to create a family Web site where I can place
genealogical history (family tree), pictures and stories of family
members. I don't want to share this outside our family. Suggestions
for a Web site?
</P>
<P>
   _Brandt Ross
</P>
<P>
   Sue: This might fit the bill. Go to www.MyFamily.com. My Uncle
Larry and Aunt Barb, who are jazzed about genealogy, pegged this
site for our family.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: I dug the free site's features. In addition to building
an online family tree, you can post family photos, anecdotes and
recipes. A log-on process offers the security you're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The site is jam-packed with possibilities. Calendaring.
E-mail. Addresses. Chat. You name it, they've got it. I just came
across something cool on that site called the Family Store. Set up
your own mom-and-pop business and sell products.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Great commercial, Sue. For comparison shopping, browse
over to www.genealogy.com or www.familytree.com.
</P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.)

 &HT;    Surprise, surprise! Framework is alive and runs on Windows
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those FBI agents on television who are always assuring
us that ``the truth is out there'' are quite right, you know. All I
need to do is express befuddlement over some issue or get something
wrong, and the truth comes flying through the transom.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it comes in like a school of wet mackerels and other
times on the gentle wings of a dove, but believe me, somebody out
there always has the truth.
</P>
<P>
   And I appreciate knowing it. I can do without the ``you imbecile
...'' openings, but it's good to have the right info and to pass it
on to those who were searching for it in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   A very kind gentleman named Charles Fuller responded to my
nostalgic ruminations about the old DOS multifunction program
Framework and the obstinate fellow who was running it in preference
to Windows. Fuller's reply, and the URL he sent along, was for me
rather like discovering an entire tribe of living Neanderthals _
all busily conversing in HTML and keeping track of their mammoth
hides in spreadsheets.
</P>
<P>
   Framework lives.
</P>
<P>
   My original correspondent had wondered whether he could copy his
old Framework program into a newer computer and run it under DOS. I
still can't answer that definitively. However, if he will go to his
modern computer and point his Internet browser to www
.framework.com, he'll be amazed.
</P>
<P>
   This one-time Ashton-Tate, then Borland product, long believed
(at least by me) extinct, is alive and well and in its sixth
iteration under the aegis of a firm called Selections &AMP; Functions.
It is still DOS-based, but it runs with any version of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher says its ``unified outline windowing environment
includes word processing, spreadsheets, databases and HTML tables,
file and directory management, data management, codeless hypertext,
text-based interpreter and rapid development computer language.''
</P>
<P>
   It is available in a number of special-purpose versions,
including one for the visually impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``While compatible with Windows 95, 98 and NT,'' its publishers
continue, ``Framework is a DOS application, giving it a significant
speed advantage over Windows applications as well as the ability to
run without Windows altogether. Framework graphic output allows it
to run both in a window under Windows and in full-screen-graphic
mode using its own fonts.''
</P>
<P>
   Astonishing, no? Consider the cultural and anthropological
implications. What would some modern young information technology
specialist think if he took a seat on the 9 a.m. train from the
suburbs next to an old guy running a fancy new IBM laptop, looked
over and saw Framework on the screen? He'd probably report it to
Scully and Mulder.

 &HT;    Forget the gizmos, just give me some old-fashioned technology
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My brother called a few moments ago. He's a small-town
physician, and I'm a blue-collar newspaperman. We love each other
but _ since we are so different _ we end up scrambling to find a
conversation sometimes. He asked me, as he usually does, ``What's
new and exciting with technology?''
</P>
<P>
   I keep up pretty well. And I know the stock answers, I know what
the buzz is, but this was my brother, not some speech I was making.
</P>
<P>
   I realized that very few of the new things that excite the real
experts do much for me. For instance, there's wireless Web use.
Gosh, I'd rather play golf than walk down the golf course,
exchanging e-mails while trying to make up an excuse for why my
drive killed a golf course goose.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's MP3, downloading music files and playing them on
one of the tiny little music machines. My CD player is easier.
Besides, the music available online is either pirated copies of
commercial songs or tunes by groups that seem to have names like
``Too Stupid to Die.'' I'd rather listen to Peggy Lee.
</P>
<P>
   New computers ... well, there are always new computers, and they
are always faster and have more nifty features. But most of them
boil down to beige-colored boxes that tend to mess up at the most
inconvenient times.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the technology companies are almost desperate
to find some world-killer application or device these days. Instead
of worrying about what the world needs, they're more concerned with
what they can do, what they can invent, not what people need.
</P>
<P>
   I get a lot of e-mail, get a lot of calls and talking to real
people _ the consumers who are made to feel almost inadequate
because they don't have Palm Pilots, cable modems or 1-gigahertz
PCs _ helps me tune out some of the hysteria that I read and hear.
Because of the e-mail, I get to talk to the real experts, the
people who would rather pay the mortgage than own a PC powerful
enough to run an astrophysics research program, who use Walkmans
instead of MP3 players, and who are just now getting fast telephone
modems and live in places where cable modems and DSL _ the
telephone company's high-speed data service _ is either unavailable
or not worth the money for ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   But I had to tell my brother something and _ being desperate _ I
told him the truth.
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm impressed by fairly mundane gadgets that are making a real
difference in people's lives. And so are many of my readers.
Instead of raving about MP3, they tell me that WebTV _ that simple
gadget that turns your TV set into an Internet machine _ has let
them join the world of cyberspace, let them send e-mail and browse
the Web without confusing them.
</P>
<P>
   _ The regular cell phone is also becoming as much a part of life
as the regular telephone and the TV. Rates have dropped to where
ordinary people can have one, and it's become a reliable lifeline
on lonely drives, an easy way to summon help. And with today's rate
plans, which often include free long-distance service, it's become
more than an auxiliary telephone. It's become the way a lot of us
call our family and friends, using that free long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   _ E-mail, that techno-dinosaur of the Internet that dates to the
days when the name World Wide Web sounded like a comic strip title,
has reinvented the art of personal correspondence. People are
writing again. And, maybe it's just my bias, but I think that it's
bringing back the art of the conversation. Sure, we've swapped
rocking chairs on the front porch for computers in the spare
bedroom, and that's not as warm and good, but it sure beats
watching prime-time TV alone.
</P>
<P>
   So what's new and exciting in technology? It's the old stuff.
And it's the truth.

 &HT;    Easter sites brimming with information
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Easter is a holiday that _ just as is true for
Christmas _ has both a deep religious meaning and also has become a
day for games and family activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Web offers information and guidance for both. So no matter
how your family celebrates the day, you should be able to find
something helpful. Unlike the Easter eggs hidden deep in the far
bushes, these sites are easy to find and use.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop on the Bunny Trail is a site called Eggs-otic
Easter. You'll find the site at
www.invision.net/easter/easterinside.html. If you'd like to share
your feelings about the day, there's a place where you can leave a
note for all the world to see. You'll find links that take you to
an Internet Easter egg hunt so, even if it rains on Easter, you can
still find eggs. Plus, there's a way to color Easter eggs online _
no mess, no fuss, all thanks to computer wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   No holiday worth its salt, or flour and sugar, is complete
without special meals, and that's certainly true of Easter. No
matter whether you celebrate the day with a fancy baked ham or a
backyard cookout while the kids hunt for eggs, there's help
available with holiday recipes.
</P>
<P>
   You'll want to check out a site at
holidayrecipe.com/features/easter.asp called Holidayrecipe.com
Easter Recipes for some good cooking ideas. Besides the expected
ham recipes, you'll find some advice on creating your own Easter
baskets from scratch and then even more help on preparing goodies
to fill them. Even the humble boiled egg gets some attention here.
</P>
<P>
   The page also offers you a way to share your own recipes. You'll
be glad to know there's some advice on what to do with the leftover
ham.
</P>
<P>
   For a look at the Christian celebration of Easter, there is a
page at www.gospelcom.net/peggiesplace/easter.htm called Christian
Easter Celebration that is worth a visit. Another site at
www.rockies.net/(tilde)spirit/sermons/easterpage.html offers
information for ministers on the holiday, along with help in
planning sermons.
</P>
<P>
   If you realize, as you began to discuss the holiday with your
family, there are parts of the tradition and history that are still
mysteries to you, there's an excellent resource at
www.geocities.com/Athens/Parthenon/1502/easte.html. It's called
Christine O'Keeffe's Easter page. You'll find links that take you
to sections explaining the egg's importance to the holiday, as well
as sections with traditional Easter games (including hiding the
eggs) and ancient history of the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   This page also has an excellent collection of links to Easter
pages on other parts of the Web. So you'll want to spend some time
investigating these pages as well.
</P>
<P>
   Another traditional Christian page, called Carolyn's Universe,
has some truly beautiful religious graphics as well as sections
that offer the traditional Christian story of Easter, plus
information on the Easter lily, Easter eggs and the Easter bunny.
One story that may not be familiar to all is the story of the
butterfly. That legend compares the metamorphosis of the
caterpillar into the butterfly to the stages of Christ's life.
You'll find Carolyn's Universe at
www.carolynsuniverse.com/easter.html.

 &HT;    CDNow is struggling, and I hope it survives
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first CD I ever bought over the Internet was from
CDNow, an online retailer now, sadly, on the skids.
</P>
<P>
   It was recommended to me by a co-worker who happened to know the
two brothers, Jason and Matthew Olim, who founded the company.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow was a wonderful source of online music launched by these
two music lovers who were frustrated by music store clerks and
often-dismal selections in the brick-and-mortar superstores like
Tower Records.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow was _ and still is _ a great place to find music from that
obscure Celtic rock band you've been hearing about or to track down
the latest techno, blues or other favorites average retailers don't
stock.
</P>
<P>
   The site is also a great source for all kinds of music, for all
kinds of tastes. Users can even make their own CDs from a selection
of music the company provides. Prices can run a little high
sometimes, but if you absolutely, positively must have your
favorite CD from your favorite artist, it's a Web site worth
checking out.
</P>
<P>
   But late last week, word went out that CDNow is in some serious
financial trouble. Shares took a big tumble to a record low of
$3.41, after the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen expressed
concerns. CDNow's shortage of working capital, losses from
operations and significant payments due this year for marketing
agreements raised a flag with the accounting company.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow says it has enough cash on hand to meet its obligations,
and that it has retained an investment banking firm to explore
options _ such as a possible sale or additional financing
arrangements. One potential merger with the Columbia House music
club fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   In the investor relations section of the CDNow site _
considerably off the beaten path before the financial woes became
public _ the company insists it has plenty of cash and plenty of
options.
</P>
<P>
   For people who love music and who love the myriad unique options
the Web provides, CDNow's troubles are worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   Just last January, the Olim brothers wrote a book documenting
their success called ``The CDNow Story: Rags to Riches on the
Internet'' with the subtitle ``How two kids in a basement grabbed
the online music business.''
</P>
<P>
   But what a difference a year makes. CDNow, the online music
store that could find anything for anybody, now must find its own
way. It faces stiff competition not just from online retailing
behemoth Amazon.com but from a variety of online record stores
including brick-and-mortar stalwarts Tower Records and the Virgin
Megastores. Truly savvy surfers can even navigate to sites all
around the world and come up with Brazilian, French or Israeli
music they can't find at their local store.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow has become the virtual ``shop around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   The small music store that features variety is in danger of
losing everything, at least partly because the big superstores like
Amazon and Tower, latecomers, are bigger, cheaper and armed with
slicker technology to make the shopping experience easy and
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Things like this happen in the real world all the time. Small,
friendly neighborhood bookstores get put out of business by the
superstore that sets up shop down the street. Small, family-owned
record companies can't compete with the volume discounts and miles
of floor space in the huge record stores. Now, with digital
download technology, some music fans aren't buying music from CDNow
or anybody else. They're downloading free MP3 files from sites like
MP3.com or Napster.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow has 3.2 million customers, a great TV ad campaign and many
of Amazon's technology gizmos. Sometimes their prices are as good
as or better than Amazon's.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company has lost $174.3 million. That's nowhere
near what Amazon.com loses in just one year, but CDNow is a less
prominent company that has never been able to explain its losses
with Amazon's finesse and conviction.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow is still very much in business, and, with a little luck,
they won't be the casualty of the great Internet shakeout pundits
and analysts have been predicting. (Grocery site Peapod.com and
health site DrKoop.com face similar situations.)
</P>
<P>
   Should CDNow get the cash infusion it needs to keep going,
hopefully it will develop a business strategy to stay up and
running for the benefit of lovers of special music, like founder
Olim, who just wanted his Miles Davis CDs.

 &HT;    Find something or everything about nothing
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the great things about the Internet is that it
eliminates the need for know-it-alls.
</P>
<P>
   Curious about which Monkee's mother invented Liquid Paper? Don't
ask the guy three desks down, who does nothing but work and watch
cable television. Just check the Web and find out about this
not-so-famous mother.
</P>
<P>
   One site in particular, www.bigwaste.com, is a virtual Wal-Mart
of seemingly worthless information.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Waste of Space Collection of Factoids,
www.bigwaste.com/library/factoids/, should be bookmarked for anyone
seeking answers to anything about nothing in particular. ``The
factoids are tidbits of information I pick up from here or there,
which take up valuable space in my brain _ space which could be
used to substantiate my value in society or to augment the quality
of humanity itself, but instead is foolishly and continuously
consumed with inutile knowledge,'' writes Wesley Treat in the
introduction. ``I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of the factoids. (Accuracy is not vouched for.)
</P>
<P>
   _ The typo-correction fluid Liquid Paper was invented by the
mother of Michael Nesmith, Monkees guitarist.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the summer of 1959, the U.S. Postal Service experimented
with the delivery of letters by guided missile.
</P>
<P>
   _ The world's first land speed record was set by an electric car
at 39 mph.
</P>
<P>
   _ George Washington's dentures weren't, as legend supposes, made
of wood, but were fashioned from hippopotamus tusk.
</P>
<P>
   _ There exists a makeshift, one-hoop basketball court inside the
peak of Disneyland's Matterhorn.
</P>
<P>
   _ From 1942 to 1945, car 3544 of the Orient Express was employed
as a French brothel.
</P>
<P>
   _ The semicolon, as it appears in English today, was used by the
ancient Greeks as a question mark.
</P>
<P>
   _ Giraffes have no vocal cords.
</P>
<P>
   _ The salt contained in all of the world's oceans could cover
the United States in a layer a mile and a half thick.
</P>
<P>
   _ The perpetually popular children's clay substance Play-Doh is
the result of an attempt to create a cleaning product for
wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the entire length of the film ``Casablanca,'' no one ever
says the words ``Play it again, Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   A TRIP TO DISNEY FAN LAND
</P>
<P>
   Wonder what all those Disney fanatics do when they're away from
the place? One Web site, laughingplace.com, gives you a good idea.
Almost makes you want to take the question back.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes updated Disney news, links to other sites,
trivia questions and opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week, the site's news section included links to an
Orlando Sentinel story about some Disney employees' confusion
regarding the new mustache policy, which allows them to be worn,
just not grown, at work.
</P>
<P>
   Another link is to an interview with Alan Thompson Jr., half of
the (Rod) Miller &AMP; Thompson duo playing ragtime duets at Disneyland
on Friday and Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   For those who care, here's the origin, for posterity, of how
they met:
</P>
<P>
   ``One day when I was at Disneyland with my marching band, I came
by the piano and asked Rod to play the `Maple Leaf Rag.' He played
it for me, and I couldn't believe how fast he could play. I doubted
I would ever be able to play like that but knew right away I had to
learn how. A couple weeks later, I came back and asked him to teach
me to play ragtime. He said, `I'm not going to teach you because I
don't teach any piano.' He told me it takes a lot of commitment and
a lot of practice, four to six hours a day. I kept bugging him for
three months. Meanwhile, I worked on improving my own ragtime
music. Impressed by my progress, he finally said `yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   A Disneyland update from the previous week was still available,
complete with an overhead photograph of Disney's California
Adventure and pictures of the Golden Gate bridge replica under
construction, the new entrance and exit turnstiles, and other
construction photos.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes discussion boards. A person with the
screen name of Tron182 was discussing the new ``Walt Disney World
Racing'' game for PlayStation last week. Tycoon11 was spending his
free time comparing Disneyland with the Magic Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll asked, ``How often do you visit a Disney theme
park?''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 163 reported respondents, 49 percent visited more than
four times a year and 45 percent came about three times but none
chose ``never.''

   EDITOR-OF-THE-YEAR (San Antonio) _ Editor &AMP; Publisher, the
leading journal of the newspaper industry, has named Robert Rivard
of the San Antonio Express-News editor of the year. It is the first
time in the magazine's 116-year history that it has bestowed the
honor, reserved for the editorial chiefs of the nation's 1,500
daily newspapers. By DICK J. REAVIS.

<P>
   LAREDO-BRIDGE (Laredo, Texas) _ If you've visited this border
city in the past five years, you've had to negotiate around the
miles of tractor-trailers lined up on the southernmost stretch of
Interstate 35 every afternoon, waiting to trundle over the
20-year-old Bridge No. 2 into Mexico. That will all be different
come Saturday, when Laredo opens its newest border crossing _ and
prohibits cargo trucks from using either downtown span. By BONNIE
PFISTER.

<P>
   NEW-CAMPUS (Merced, Calif.) _ Despite nearly universal
popularity in the Central Valley and the enthusiastic backing of
California Gov. Gray Davis and Vice President Al Gore, the
University of California at Merced is no slam dunk. Opposition to
situating the UC system's 10th campus in the grasslands north of
Merced is coalescing around the issue of protecting thousands of
vernal pools. By ERIC BRAZIL.

   AUTO-COLUMN (San Antonio) _ When Buick rolls out its all-new
Rendezvous sport-utility vehicle next spring, it will be none too
soon for dealers nationwide. They have had to deal almost daily
with loyal customers who want to buy another Buick product but feel
the need for a sport-utility rather than a sedan. By G. CHAMBERS
WILLIAMS III.
</P>
<P>
   GM-PICKUPS (Undated) _ The styling of General Motors' updated
GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado isn't radically different from
the previous generation. Instead, GM spent the money more wisely,
improving just about every other aspect of the vehicle as well as
tuning up the styling. The result is a pickup that not only is much
better than it was before, but which also outshines its
competitors. By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III.

   ONLINE-TRADER (San Francisco) _ Last week, Nasdaq plunged and I
decided to take the dive, too. I became an online stock trader. And
if I can be a little smug, I didn't do so badly for somebody who
didn't have a clue what she was doing. By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU.

   FBN-DRAFT (San Francisco) _ With next weekend's NFL draft,
you'll be hearing an awful lot about such former student-athletes
as LaVar Arrington, Courtney Brown, Peter Warrick and Chris
Samuels. In most mock NFL drafts, these will be the first four
players chosen, though not necessarily in that order. By JOHN

the San Francisco 49ers are compelled to look for a QB in next
week's draft. By JOHN CRUMPACKER.
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Can you imagine catching two
striped bass at once _ including one that wasn't even hooked? A
miracle? Well, maybe there is still time for miracles for the
striped
</P>
<P>
   bass in the San Francisco Bay and Delta. You see, on a trip to
the Delta this past week, we really did catch a striped bass
without using even a hook (and we'll get to that). By TOM

</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The other night I watched the new
mental hospital drama ``Wonderland'' with one of the toughest of
critics _ a former mental patient. The ABC show has been praised by
TV critics for realistically portraying life in a big-city
emergency psychiatric ward. It has been panned by the National
Alliance of the Mentally Ill for portraying the mentally ill as
violent. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   BANK-OF-AMERICA (San Francisco) _ In the year and a half since
the Bank of American was taken over, the bank's stock price has
fallen, then fallen again, at times hovering under half of what it
was at the time the two companies merged. More significant for San
Franciscans, the old Bank of America _ an institution nearly a
century in the making _ has disappeared almost overnight. By GAIL
TODD.

TO SAVE FACE, KARPAN MOVED FROM MINING AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone gave Kathy Karpan, director of the U.S. Office of
Surface Mining, bad advice about accepting a job interview with a
mining industry advocacy association. As a consequence, on April
10, she became former chief of the nation's top coal-mining
regulatory agency.
</P>
<P>
   On April 7, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt announced
the management change. Karpan has been reassigned. She will be
acting deputy assistant secretary of land and minerals management,
responsible for non-mining issues involving the Bureau of Land
Management and the Minerals Management Service. It's a titular job,
one without much authority or responsibility. The position is
layers below the power to make real decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt can authorize as many acting deputy assistants as he
sees fit to effectively run his department. Acting deputy
assistants and deputy assistants do not need to be confirmed by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   To fill in the new vacancy, Kathrine Henry, Interior's associate
solicitor for the Division of Minerals Resources, became acting
director of the Office of Surface Mining. Henry was acting director
of OSM for nearly a year before Karpan took the position in August
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, Henry will remain as chief of OSM until the end of
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Karpan interviewed for the position of president of
the National Mining Association, the very industry her agency is
charged with regulating under the federal Surface Mining Control
and Reclamation Act of 1977. In doing so, Karpan crossed the line
between what has the appearance of propriety and what does not. And
appearances are everything.
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely rare for the head of an federal agency, while
still in that position, to interview for a job in the private
sector with an industry the agency regulates. The inherent conflict
of interest is overwhelming. The appearance of a conflict of
interest is overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewing for the mining job raises too many questions about
previous mining regulatory decisions Karpan had made. Had she ruled
in favor of the mining industry to curry favor for such a job
opportunity? Would Karpan rule against the mining industry in
retaliation if she didn't get the position? She could no longer be
an effective director of OSM.
</P>
<P>
   Karpan's position there was tainted. She had to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   Back in mid-March, Karpan was contacted by a headhunter for the
National Mining Association, to see if she was interested in
interviewing for the association's top job. She was apparently told
that the decision would be made in a week. And no doubt she was
told she would be on a very short list of finalists for the
position _ which pays nearly half a million dollars a year, more
than four times what she made as head the regulatory agency.
</P>
<P>
   It's the nature of politics in the nation's capital that when a
president's term of office is nearly over, public officials begin
looking for work in the private sector. The desire to secure a job
in business before one's government job ends is understandable. The
experience federal employees have gained from working in the
government can be useful to many large corporations and
multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   Karpan sought the advice of the Department of the Interior's
Office of Ethics. Although she did not inform Babbitt's office of
the interview, Karpan did everything else according to the rules.
She submitted a written request to recuse herself from any
decisions regarding the mining industry from March 15 to March 26.
Since no decision had been made about the job with the mining
association by March 26, Karpan then took a two-week vacation. That
vacation ended April 9.
</P>
<P>
   So on April 10, she began a new job within the Department of the
Interior _ insulated from all mining issues. Essentially, Karpan
can sit in her new job until she can quietly and gracefully resign.
</P>
<P>
   The current president of the National Mining Association,
Richard Lawson, isn't slated to retire until the end of the year.
If Karpan gets the mining association job, she can continue to draw
a federal paycheck until Lawson packs up and heads out.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's decision to move Karpan saves face for Karpan and ends
the appearance of impropriety at the Department of Interior's
Office of Surface Mining.
</P>
<P>
   In merely shifting Karpan from her former duties, Babbitt gave a
nod to how well she had run OSM. In the five years before Karpan
took over the agency, the Office of Surface Mining had gone through
five different directors. The agency's morale was low and it hadn't
been operating effectively. Karpan turned that around in less than
three years.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get Karpan's side of the story, attempts were
made to reach her. But Karpan did not return calls to her Virginia
home on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Karpan could have saved herself and the department a great deal
of criticism had she asked to be moved out of the Office of Surface
Mining before she had interviewed with the mining association.
There was another option, of course _ she could have resigned
before interviewing. Either choice would have been preferable to
what she did.
</P>
<P>
   We expect a great deal of our public officials, perhaps too
much. We hold them to high ethical standards, pay them much less
than they would get in the private sector and demand they stay
clear of even the appearance of impropriety. It is difficult if not
impossible to strike a fair balance in these matters. Nevertheless,
Karpan came up with the short straw.
</P>
<P>
   Karpan had to make up her mind whether to be interviewed for the
mining association position when she was queried by telephone. She
had a few moments to think about it. Perhaps the lure of the money
caused a brief glitch in Karpan's thought processes. In her years
as a public servant in Wyoming, however, Karpan showed remarkable
political savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Karpan, an attorney, is the daughter of a coal miner and a
native of Rock Springs. She knows the coal industry.
</P>
<P>
   From 1984 to 1986, Karpan ran Wyoming's Department of Health and
Social Services, one of the state's largest agencies. She resigned
in 1986 to run for the second highest office in Wyoming, the
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   She was elected and then re-elected to that office in 1990. She
was a strong secretary of state who had a firm grasp of the issues
and wasn't afraid to make tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Karpan ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic candidate for
governor of Wyoming in 1994. And she made an unsuccessful bid to
fill the Senate seat vacated by former Sen. Al Simpson in 1996. She
lost to Mike Enzi.
</P>
<P>
   The episode is over, but it has left a bad odor in the air. And
it will linger awhile _ despite the corrective measures taken by
Babbitt. It is likely, however, that Karpan's reputation will carry
a whiff of it for a much longer time. And that's too bad.

 &HT;    STUDY SAYS MANY GIRLS DISDAIN COMPUTER CAREERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Girls are avoiding high-tech careers not because
they fear failing, but because they believe computer jobs are
boring and lonely, according to a study released Tuesday(cq).
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, they use e-mail and the Internet and word
processing, but when it comes to computer fluency _ finding
innovative ways to use information technology or to adapt new
technologies as they emerge _ girls and women just aren't in the
forefront,'' said Pamela Haag, director of research for the AAUW
Educational Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to hearing a lot about math and science phobia''
among older girls, Haag said. But, she said, when the researchers
talked to girls in middle school and high school, ``it wasn't that
they were anxious about technology, they were estranged from it and
opting out from acquiring skills that are key to our economy and
will be key to our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Her foundation, an affiliate of the American Association of
University Women, paid for the two-year study, which was directed
by a predominantly female commission of 15 prominent researchers,
teachers, journalists and entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Only one-fifth of high tech jobs are held by women, the
commission said. Moreover, on-the-job use of technology lags among
teachers, about three-fourths of whom are women.
</P>
<P>
   The commission predicted that women will continue to trail men
in computer-related activities until there are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Changes in ``tedious and dull'' computer science courses that
weed out most students, rather than arouse interest in the field.
</P>
<P>
   _ More use of classroom technology to study non-technical
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   _ Education for today's teachers that goes beyond ``drive-by''
workshops to emphasize how teachers can design instruction that
takes advantage of new technology.
</P>
<P>
   _ Creation of new ``high skill'' computer games that appeal to
boys and girls, as an alternative to today's ``high kill'' action
games for boys and ``pink'' passive games for girls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marketing campaigns that smash the stereotype of the high-tech
workplace as a sterile set of cubicles full of boring men who are
better at relating to machines than to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``When asked, girls and women describe a prevailing concern that
computer science will stunt their diverse range of intellectual
pursuits and interests,'' the commission said. ``Girls tend to
imagine that computer professionals live in a solitary, antisocial
and sedentary world.''
</P>
<P>
   Disputing that stereotype, the commission said, ``Tinkering with
(computer) code need not be seen as less artistic than tinkering
with color, form and shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Its recommendation: ``Educators, parents, employers and guidance
counselors need to impart a more complex, realistic view of jobs
that rely heavily or centrally on computer technology. Many of
these jobs emphasize communication, collaboration and creativity.''

better at relating to machines than to people.

   ``When asked, girls and women describe a prevailing concern that
computer science will stunt their diverse range of intellectual
pursuits and interests,'' the commission said. ``Girls tend to
imagine that computer professionals live in a solitary, antisocial
and sedentary world.''
</P>
<P>
   Disputing that stereotype, the commission said, ``Tinkering with
(computer) code need not be seen as less artistic than tinkering
with color, form and shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Its recommendation: ``Educators, parents, employers and guidance
counselors need to impart a more complex, realistic view of jobs
that rely heavily or centrally on computer technology. Many of
these jobs emphasize communication, collaboration and creativity.''

 (Includes a color slide of Paul Newman dancing with Linda
Fiorentino in a scene from ``Where the Money Is.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Paul Newman was born in 1925. When you do the math, it doesn't
seems possible.
 &HT;    The Hollywood icon, race-car driver and hugely successful
food-products marketer isn't just aging gracefully _ at 75, he
hardly seems to be aging at all.
 &HT;    You can see the evidence in ``Where The Money Is,'' opening
April 14 nationwide. Newman plays a convicted bank robber who scams
his way out of prison into a nursing home by faking a debilitating
stroke, only to run into a nurse (Linda Fiorentino) who has a
larcenous streak of her own.
 &HT;    And, yes, sparks fly between the pair in the kind of caper movie
that Newman hasn't tackled since ``Butch Cassidy and The Sundance
Kid'' (1969) and ``The Sting'' (1973), or at least ``The Color of
Money'' (1986).
 &HT;    ``There was a lot of larceny in it,'' Newman says with a slight
smile, ``which brought me back to Butch Cassidy, `The Color of
Money's' Fast Eddie and Henry Gondorff from `The Sting.'''
 &HT;    Newman pulls up his sleeve to reveal a sleek but inexpensive
digital runner's watch.
 &HT;    ``There's something so attractive about larceny,'' he says.
``One of the great hustles is this $49 watch I'm wearing, which is
amazingly accurate. When guys who have Rolexes come up to me, they
say, `Why are you wearing that piece of junk?'
 &HT;    ``I say, `I'll bet your fancy watch is at least 20 seconds off
and mine is on the money,''' Newman says, his eyes gleaming. ``I
get them to bet me a hundred bucks. Then they say, `But how can we
check?' And I say, `Well, you can call that time number at the
Naval Observatory.' They say, `Well, how can we get that number?'
 &HT;    ``And I say, `It's (202) 762-140l.'''
 &HT;    Newman settles back with a chuckle.
 &HT;    ``Of course they hand over the hundred bucks without even
bothering to call,'' he says. ``They know they've been hustled.''
 &HT;    Newman's cheerfully down-to-earth manner reflects his demeanour
on movie sets, where he's famous for his professionalism, his
absence of star attitude and his pleasure in the collaborative
camaraderie of movie-making.
 &HT;    ``I think of it as a community,'' he says. ``The best work
always comes out of exploring, inventing and imagining together.
Even out of terrible ideas you get some wonderful moments. My
philosophy is, if it isn't fun to get up in the morning and go to
the set, then why the hell do it?
 &HT;    ``I like to play around between scenes,'' he admits, ``but five
minutes before the cameras roll I want to make sure everything has
quieted down. You've got to exercise discipline and let everybody
know the horseplay is over and it's time to work.''
 &HT;    The focus of ``Where the Money Is'' may be his character's one
last bank job, but that didn't keep him from doing the research
necessary to fake a stroke convincingly.
 &HT;    ``I went to a rehabilitation hospital,'' he says, ``and spent
some time with stroke victims. You watch them, observe them, as you
would any other person you want to put up on the screen.''
 &HT;    He's done that dozens of times, in the process creating a
gallery of memorable characters whom the public adores, sometimes
to the point of confusing them with Newman himself.
 &HT;    ``That doesn't have anything to do with me,'' the actor says.
``The things I say are written for me, all those great one-liners.
The lady who is co-starring with you has been instructed by the
director to fall in love with you in front of the camera. The real
Paul Newman is not what you see on the screen.''
 &HT;    That distinction isn't always clear to his fans, he adds.
 &HT;    ``Right after I did Rocky Graziano in `Somebody Up There Likes
Me' (1956),'' he recalls, ``I went with a bunch of people to have a
few beers down on Second Avenue. Guys would walk up and smack me on
the shoulder and say, `You think you're so tough? You think you're
a boxer?'
 &HT;    ``Then, after `The Color of Money,' I'd be in a bar with a pool
table and somebody would say, `How about a little game? We don't
have to play for money, what would you like to play for?'
 &HT;    ``I'd say, `How about your house?''' Newman says with a laugh.
``That usually ended the conversation.''
 &HT;    More recently, he adds, he may have alienated some of his fans
without really meaning to.
 &HT;    ``I cut my finger slicing some green peppers,'' he says. ``It
was really bad, bleeding pretty profusely. So I hopped on my motor
scooter and went down to the hospital. The doctor fixed it up and
said, `I want you to keep that finger elevated. Hold it up in the
air.'
 &HT;    ``Well,'' he says with a grin, ``it happened to be my middle
finger. So as I walked out of the emergency room holding my middle
finger up, people were looking at me like, `Why is Paul Newman
doing that to us?'''
 &HT;    Newman is making fewer films nowadays, feeling that at this
stage in his career he can afford to be selective. ``Where the
Money Is'' provides his first starring role since ``Twilight''
(1998), and is his first film since a supporting turn in ``Message
in a Bottle'' (1999). Instead, he's devoting more time to Newman's
Own, the food-products line through which he raises money for
several charities.
 &HT;    ``If someone had told me 20 years ago that I'd have my face on a
bottle of salad dressing, I'd have had them committed,'' the actor
says. ``I'm glad that the money goes for good causes. I don't
exactly live low on the hog, so I can afford it.
 &HT;    ``I think it's better to give it away in your lifetime,'' he
adds, ``so you can see the benefits. I don't understand people who
hoard their fortunes and give them away after they're gone.''
 &HT;    Newman's other passion remains driving fast cars _ which in
January led to a serious accident at the practice run for the
Daytona 500.
 &HT;    ``Bad judgment,'' he says matter-of-factly. ``But I'd rather
drive at Daytona than on I-95. It's safer there than on the freeway
_ at least you're pretty sure the guy in front of you isn't going
to do something stupid. I may do something stupid, but that leaves
the guy behind me out of luck.''
 &HT;    There aren't a lot of 75-year-olds out racing cars, but Newman
says that his durability there, like his longevity as an actor, is
simply a matter of luck.
 &HT;    ``I'm just very fortunate that my body hasn't abandoned me
yet,'' he says after a moment's thought. ``That's the luck of the
draw. If you're born with the right metabolism, you're just
lucky.''
 &HT;    A lot of actors say they hope to work until their dying day, but
Newman freely admits that he expects to retire fairly soon.
 &HT;    ``I've talked about it,'' he says. ``In fact, I think I've been
retiring every year for the past 15 years. I'd like to do one more
great film that would be my swan song _ a film with my wife Joanne
or Robert Redford or Tom Cruise. I'd love to find a really
memorable film to go out on.
 &HT;    ``At some point you have to get out,'' Newman says. ``I don't
want to retire on my knees.''

A MATTER OF TIME: JAMES CAVIEZEL STARS IN `FREQUENCY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of James Caviezel in a scene from
``Frequency.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    James Caviezel has ``The Twilight Zone'' on the brain.
 &HT;    ``I remember the one where they don't show the girl's face and
she's getting plastic surgery to look like one of the pig people,''
Caviezel says. ``I remember the one with the boy sending everyone
out to the corn, and I remember the one with this woman who would
never die, who'd stick a beetle on you and age you. That one got
me.''
 &HT;    Caviezel, the intense young actor whose credits include ``My Own
Private Idaho'' (1991), ``Wyatt Earp'' (1993), Terrence Malick's
``The Thin Red Line'' (1998) and Ang Lee's ``Ride with the Devil''
(1999), has an appetite for the weird.
 &HT;    ``I believe in a lot of that,'' he says. ``There are so many
solar systems. I wouldn't hesitate to think there are other
civilizations out there. There are a lot of apparitions that
happen, that have been happening for centuries.
 &HT;    ``I wouldn't put any limitations on God,'' he adds. ``Part of me
wants to believe. It gives me hope.''
 &HT;    Caviezel's latest film, ``Frequency,'' is all about sci-fi and
hope. It's also about father-son bonding, a serial killer and
hearing dead people.
 &HT;    Caviezel stars as John Sullivan, a somber New York cop whose
firefighter father, Frank (Dennis Quaid), died nearly 30 years ago
in a blaze. One night, however, a freak atmospheric phenomenon
allows John to communicate with Frank via ham radio, with John in
1999 and Frank in 1969, one day before his date with destiny.
 &HT;    Hoping to save his father's life, John warns him about what is
to come, and inadvertently triggers a series of unpredictable
consequences _ including murder _ which threatens to throw history
as we know it completely out of whack.
 &HT;    ``The film is a number of things, and everybody is going to see
something different,'' the soft-spoken actor says during an
interview at New York's Regency Hotel. Caviezel is sporting
dark-brown hair, a scruffy beard, black-rimmed plastic glasses and
a gray sports coat over a camelhair vest.
 &HT;    ``It was the father-son relationship that drove me to want to do
it,'' he explains, ``and that's set in the trappings of a
sci-fi/suspense thriller. What I liked, in reading it, was how the
genres switched.
 &HT;    ``The last time I saw a movie like that was `Life Is Beautiful'
(1998),'' he adds. ``Who, going into it, knew the Holocaust would
emerge from the beginnings of a love affair? That combination
weaved together very nicely, and I thought `Frequency' did the same
kind of thing.''
 &HT;    Given his affection for sci-fi and an abiding belief in God, the
31-year-old actor didn't find it hard to make his character or the
situation feel real.
 &HT;    ``Regardless of any religious affiliation, if you have some sort
of belief in the unknown, that there's something out there ... I
have that element in me,'' Caviezel says, ``and I used that. I
think films like `Frequency' or `Ghost' (1990) or `The Sixth Sense'
(1999) have an element that people want to believe. They want to
believe in the hereafter.
 &HT;    ``I just used the ham radio and the aurora borealis in
`Frequency' as a metaphor for that,'' he says. ``When you lose
somebody you love _ and my father had a near-miss with death after
open-heart surgery _ you look back and think of all the things you
wish you had done.
 &HT;    ``Here, it's great to go to a film and fantasize about that,''
he adds. ``Would you change paths? Would you do things that may
cause severe consequences?''
 &HT;    For himself, he says, he doubts that he'd change anything.
 &HT;    ``I don't think I would,'' he says thoughtfully. ``Everything
happens for a reason. I believe in the theory that life gives you a
lemon and you can turn it into lemonade. Even the bad things that
happen in our lives, good things can happen from them.
 &HT;    ``Learning can be that way at times, but there are a lot of
benefits from it,'' the actor says. ``It's kind of like working out
_ I don't particularly enjoy it, but it's great when I hit that
shower.'
 &HT;    Caviezel's take on acting is equally colorful. The two elements
that he most appreciates, he says, are those moments when he
connects with a fellow actor and the opportunity to touch
moviegoers in a darkened theater.
 &HT;    ``I know when I see movies I get something from watching an
actor on screen,'' he says. ``Even before I became an actor, I felt
that. That's pretty powerful.
 &HT;    ``So I enjoy going to theaters and seeing people react,''
Caviezel says. ``(A performance) is something I can give to
someone, and it's very fulfilling for me. I see acting as a
service.''
 &HT;    Caviezel, who grew up in the state of Washington, where he still
lives with his wife, began acting in the early 1990s, first as a
guest star on such television shows as ``The Wonder Years.'' Later
he made his movie debut with a small role in Gus Van Sant's ``My
Own Private Idaho.'' Bigger roles in bigger films followed, among
them ``Ed'' (1996) and ``G.I. Jane'' (1997).
 &HT;    Slowly but steadily, he's climbed the Hollywood ladder. But,
while proud of his accomplishments, Caviezel cringes when he sees
the ``Frequency'' publicity, which has his and Quaid's names above
the title _ tangible proof that he's finally achieved stardom.
 &HT;    ``I don't really think about it,'' he says. ``Whenever the
agents say, `We're going to get your name above the title,' I say,
`Just make the movie good.'
 &HT;    ``To me, the film business, what I do, is a service,'' he adds.
``Being where I'm at is such a miracle anyway. I was a basketball
player _ I went to movies, and I felt this real strong calling
inside that said, `You're supposed to be an actor.' I talked to my
dad, and he said, `You don't want to get into that crap.' I said,
`Yeah, yeah. You're right.'
 &HT;    ``Through a twist of fate _ what if? _ I broke my foot,'' he
recalls. ``My college coach said, `You always screw around doing
these impersonations. Why don't you go talk to the drama
teacher?'''
 &HT;    Caviezel shrugs.
 &HT;    ``It just happened that way,'' he says. ``So many times I wanted
to quit. I just can't believe I'm here sometimes.
 &HT;    ``I hope I always feel that way,'' Caviezel adds. ``It keeps me
grounded. I have great family. I have people who tell me things I
might not want to hear, but that I ought to hear. That's important.
 &HT;    ``So the simple things are the things that I don't ever want to
lose,'' he concludes. ``I saw that in Terrence Malick. He will
always be my father in film. It's good to have a mentor like him in
the film business, because he kind of holds you accountable.''
 &HT;    Caviezel will next turn up in the family boat-racing drama
``Madison'' and then the uplifting ``Pay It Forward'' with Kevin
Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment.
 &HT;    But while he may be on a roll, he's clearly struggling with his
newfound stardom. Fortunately, he got some advice from another
reluctant star that still rings loud and clear.
 &HT;    ``Jimmy Stewart told me, `This is a service. If you serve people
and look at it from that point of view, you will always find it
fulfilling,''' he says. ``People ask if acting is noble. It is
noble to serve.''
 &HT;    Jimmy Stewart?
 &HT;    ``It was 1991,'' Caviezel says, smiling sheepishly. ``I was at
(producer) Jerry Weintraub's house.
 &HT;    ``I was a waiter.''

 (Includes a color slide of Bruce Willis with David Schwimmer in a
scene from ``Friends.'') 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not for release in Canada until 23 April. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes even friends need friends.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Matthew Perry, who recently invited a pal to drop by
and guest-star on a few ``Friends'' episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox Arquette and company didn't complain
too much _ after all, Perry's friend was big-screen superstar Bruce
Willis.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing Willis, with whom he made the current box-office smash
``The Whole Nine Yards,'' has given Perry a whole new perspective
on life in the spotlight. For the first few years of ``Friends,''
the young actor found himself uncomfortable with his own
popularity. It was last year, during the making of ``The Whole Nine
Yards,'' that he found a new comfort level.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it kind of goes in waves,'' Perry says. ``When we
first started being in the public eye, I was the one who just loved
it. In that first season, I was going to malls, humming the theme
song, hoping to get recognized ... Later, the attention was too
much. Now, I'm just used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry's newfound ease is well-timed, considering his current
status as a genuine movie star. Released several weeks back, ``The
Whole Nine Yards'' came from virtually nowhere to become one of
this year's biggest feature hits, holding the No. 1 box-office spot
against all comers for three straight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He may have achieved stardom on ``Friends,'' but Perry admits he
was a little nervous about acting alongside Willis, who _ though he
also got his start on television, as co-star of ``Moonlighting''
(1985-1989) _ has been one of Hollywood's top international stars
since ``Die Hard'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the first big star that I've worked with,'' Perry says,
``so I was kind of intimidated. I wasn't sure how the dynamic would
work, but he got a kick out of being funny again.''
</P>
<P>
   He got a taste of Willis' notoriously jocular humor even before
filming began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me before I accepted the part and left a message on
my machine _ `Hey, Matthew. Call me back or I'll burn your house
down!,''' Perry recalls. ``It was funny. I called him back _ I was
pacing all over my house talking to him _ and, by the end, we were
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Good enough friends, in fact, that he was able to convince
Willis to pay a return visit, guest-starring in a three-week arc of
``Friends,'' starting April 27, as the stern widower father of a
20-year-old young lady who happens to be dating Ross (David
Schwimmer).
</P>
<P>
   This sort of stunt-cast ratings trick has worked well for
``Friends'' in the past _ previous guest stars have included Julia
Roberts, George Clooney, Noah Wyle and Brooke Shields _ and it
demonstrates that the show's producers still know how to keep
things interesting.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Perry says he believes that ``Friends'' is fresher than
ever in this, its seventh season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have more momentum this season than ever before,''
he says matter-of-factly, relaxing on a beat-up sofa on the
``Friends'' set. ``I think the show has always been good. There's
just been a certain dynamic in the press to build it up, then tear
it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like that with `Seinfeld,''' he adds. ``All of a
sudden, people were saying `Seinfeld' was terrible in its fifth
year. But it wasn't _ it was the same show.''
</P>
<P>
   He blames that same negativity for the way the media has
approached those ``Friends'' stars who have made feature-film
forays. Aside from Kudrow, who won critical plaudits in ``The
Opposite of Sex'' (1998) and ``Analyze This'' (1999), and Cox
Arquette's role in the ensemble ``Scream'' films, the press has
generally lacerated the movie work of the ``Friends'' cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little unfair,'' says Perry, who prior to ``The Whole
Nine Yards'' had appeared in such misfires as ``Fools Rush In''
(1996) and ``Almost Heroes'' (1998). ``I think there is a bit of,
`A David Schwimmer movie must do better, because he's on TV all the
time.' It doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Passing by, Perry's co-star and on-camera romantic interest
Courteney Cox Arquette agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who just do movies can have failures and it's OK,'' she
says. ``But with us it's, like, `Whoa! Another Friend bites the
dust! Keep your day job!'''
</P>
<P>
   That day job has been hopping lately, with the ongoing romance
between Chandler (Perry) and longtime pal Monica (Cox Arquette)
keeping fans in a tizzy. However, Perry cautions that viewers
shouldn't necessarily expect to see the two live happily ever
after.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the secret these days to a successful TV show is
to keep people unhappy,'' Perry says with Chandler-esque
resignation. ``You don't want to see a happy couple. If you just
had Monica and Chandler in love, staring at the stars, people
aren't going to watch that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he turned 30 only a few months ago, Perry is actually
the seasoned acting veteran of the ``Friends'' cast, having been
working steadily since the 1987 Fox sitcom ``Second Chance.'' He
admits that it's tough playing the same character week in and week
out, but claims that taping in front of a live audience is what
gives ``Friends'' that extra boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps a lot,'' he says. ``I mean, we've done a silly amount
of shows, more than 130 shows or something. And we still get
nervous before the show, which is cool. The day I don't get nervous
before the show is the day I probably shouldn't be here anymore.
</P>
<P>

``your performance just comes up. It's like putting on a different
one-act play every week.''

   Perry isn't contenting himself with merely playing Chandler,
either. He wrote one of this season's episodes of ``Friends,'' and
is developing a pilot for ABC, called ``The Shrink.'' As if that
weren't enough, the success of ``The Whole Nine Yards'' has left
him fielding a slew of film offers for his next summer hiatus.

   If everything falls into place, who knows? He might wind up as
famous as his friend Bruce.

   If he does, though, Perry says he can handle it.

   ``The good far outweighs the bad,'' he says with a shrug. ``Now,
if there's a guy outside my house taking pictures, I don't have to
panic about it. People aren't chasing us around anymore _ they're
chasing around the new 18-or-19-year-old stars.''

 (Includes a color slide of Sophia Coppola directing Kirsten Dunst
in a scene from ``The Virgin Suicides.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Sofia Coppola began studying filmmaking as a preschooler.
 &HT;    ``At age 4, I was in the Philippines hanging out on the set of
`Apocalypse Now' (1979),'' says the daughter of legendary director
Francis Ford Coppola. ``I remember being helicoptered into the
jungle. It was like one great big adventure.''
 &HT;    Her education continued on the set of ``The Godfather, Part
III'' (1990), which Coppola calls ``my acting debut and one of the
most uncomfortable times of my life. Let's just say the critics
were harsh.''
 &HT;    Her graduate school was watching her father deal with bankruptcy
and what seemed at the time like the end of his Hollywood career.
 &HT;    ``I learned from him that, no matter what, you never give up,''
Coppola says. ``I never remember my father losing faith in his art
_ I don't remember him ever being discouraged.''
 &HT;    And now Coppola has stepped into the arena herself, writing and
directing a big-screen adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' cult novel
``The Virgin Suicides,'' the story of three death-obsessed sisters
in 1970s Michigan and the neighborhood boys who are obsessed with
them.
 &HT;    To help get her first major film, which will open April 21, to
the big screen, Coppola recruited an impressive, eclectic cast that
includes Danny DeVito, Kathleen Turner, James Woods, Kirsten Dunst,
Josh Harnett and Giovanni Ribisi.
 &HT;    The only name in the credits that didn't seem to belong was her
own, she says, since previously the only thing she had directed was
a short for the Bravo cable channel.
 &HT;    ``Of course, the name Coppola gets you in the door,'' says the
novice director, who is also the cousin of Nicolas Cage and the
niece of Talia Shire. ``You can get the assignment. But from then
on you really have to prove yourself.''
 &HT;    Since first reading the book, she had sensed that ``The Virgin
Suicides'' would be that proving-ground.
 &HT;    ``It's not often that you fall in love with a piece of
literature,'' she says. ``In my own mind, I was almost picturing
the movie as I read it.''
 &HT;    But a film adaptation was already in the works at another
studio, with another director. Nonetheless, Coppola jotted down a
few ideas. A year later, she began tinkering with a script ``for
the fun of it.''
 &HT;    Suddenly, however, the other studio dropped its plans, and
Coppola was able to acquire the rights.
 &HT;    ``I almost couldn't believe it,'' she says. ``Honestly, I felt
like I was meant to do this story.''
 &HT;    Still, the decision to direct it herself was difficult.
 &HT;    ``I was so close to the material that I couldn't imagine anyone
else directing it,'' she says. ``But still, the first day we shot
in Toronto, I was very nervous. Driving to the set, my biggest fear
was that I was going to suddenly freeze up and the cast would look
at me and say, `So what should we do?'
 &HT;    ``In my nightmare scenario, I would go blank and everyone would
say, `Replace her.'''
 &HT;    Even though the film was being produced by Francis Ford
Coppola's American Zoetrope, there was one place she didn't turn
for help.
 &HT;    ``It would have been so easy to pick up a phone and say, `Dad,
what should I do?''' Coppola says.
 &HT;    ``I am guilty of trying to remember all the advice he had given
me over the years,'' she admits. ``For instance, on many sets he
told me that good directors do not stand by the video camera and
watch the takes. He told me that you sit right next to the camera,
so you are connected with the actors.
 &HT;    ``My father feels you distance yourself if you're absorbed with
a video monitor.''
 &HT;    She didn't take all his advice, though.
 &HT;    ``I remember him telling me to sit down and try to nap between
shots,'' Coppola says. ``Sorry, Dad, I just couldn't do that on my
set. We shot this movie in 29 days _ there wasn't time to sit
down.''
 &HT;    Complicating matters was that she had recently been married to
another first-time director, Spike Jonze, who was then making
``Being John Malkovich'' (1999).
 &HT;    ``We both shot our first movies at the same time,'' Coppola
recalls. ``In a way it was bad, because we were newlyweds and these
movies were taking over our lives. But we could understand what the
other person was thinking and feeling _ we would comfort each other
during the rough moments.''
 &HT;    All the more ironic, then, that as a child growing up in Napa
Valley, Calif., Coppola never planned on a career in filmmaking.
After seeing her father's struggles, she wanted to be a painter.
 &HT;    Her father thought she should try acting, however, and when
Winona Ryder dropped out of ``The Godfather, Part III,'' the
director hired his daughter to make her screen debut _ one which
became one of the most panned in Hollywood history.
 &HT;    ``I was 18, and it was one of the most uncomfortable times in my
life,'' Coppola admits. ``I didn't read every single review, but I
read a lot of them. I was aware of the criticism, and frankly I
thought it was unfair.
 &HT;    ``First of all, it was so harsh,'' she says, wincing. ``Can you
imagine being so young and having them pick on what your face looks
like in a close-up?
 &HT;    ``I wasn't totally devastated, because I wasn't preparing to
become some great actress,'' she concludes. ``I got slammed, but I
could rationalize it and think, `So what? This was an experiment.
And at least I'll never say that I didn't try it.'''
 &HT;    Afterwards, Coppola dabbled in clothing design.
 &HT;    ``I didn't know what I wanted to do,'' she says. ``I knew I was
interested in film, but it was too daunting to admit to myself that
I wanted to be a director.''
 &HT;    Nowadays, she's willing to admit it. In fact, she's already
writing her next project, which she hopes to direct next year.
 &HT;    ``It's been a crazy year,'' she says with a laugh. ``I finished
the mix on my movie the night before our wedding. Any other groom
would have been really mad that his bride was so occupied. My
future husband completely understood.
 &HT;    ``He did his mix right after our honeymoon!''
 &HT;    Jonze's new father-in-law also understood.
 &HT;    ``My father is an inspiration to both of us,'' Coppola says. ``I
just hope to have my father's enthusiasm when I'm his age. My
father will still come home from a set completely excited about
what he learned about moviemaking on that particular day. It's
still a grand adventure for him.''
 &HT;    And, yes, she's still eager to win his approval.
 &HT;    ``To tell you the truth,'' she says, ``my most nerve-wracking
moment is when I sent my father the script I wrote for `The Virgin
Suicides.'''
 &HT;    The next day the phone rang, and the novice screenwriter's heart
was in her throat.
 &HT;    ``He didn't even give me a note or a suggestion,'' Coppola says.
``My dad simply said, `You should make this film. This is the kind
of movie I want to do someday, too.'
 &HT;    ``I couldn't get a better compliment.''

BANK SHOT: PAUL NEWMAN IS BACK `WHERE THE MONEY IS'

 (Includes a color slide of Paul Newman dancing with Linda
Fiorentino in a scene from ``Where the Money Is.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Paul Newman was born in 1925. When you do the math, it doesn't
seems possible.
 &HT;    The Hollywood icon, race-car driver and hugely successful
food-products marketer isn't just aging gracefully _ at 75, he
hardly seems to be aging at all.
 &HT;    You can see the evidence in ``Where The Money Is,'' opening
April 14 nationwide. Newman plays a convicted bank robber who scams
his way out of prison into a nursing home by faking a debilitating
stroke, only to run into a nurse (Linda Fiorentino) who has a
larcenous streak of her own.
 &HT;    And, yes, sparks fly between the pair in the kind of caper movie
that Newman hasn't tackled since ``Butch Cassidy and The Sundance
Kid'' (1969) and ``The Sting'' (1973), or at least ``The Color of
Money'' (1986).
 &HT;    ``There was a lot of larceny in it,'' Newman says with a slight
smile, ``which brought me back to Butch Cassidy, `The Color of
Money's' Fast Eddie and Henry Gondorff from `The Sting.'''
 &HT;    Newman pulls up his sleeve to reveal a sleek but inexpensive
digital runner's watch.
 &HT;    ``There's something so attractive about larceny,'' he says.
``One of the great hustles is this $49 watch I'm wearing, which is
amazingly accurate. When guys who have Rolexes come up to me, they
say, `Why are you wearing that piece of junk?'
 &HT;    ``I say, `I'll bet your fancy watch is at least 20 seconds off
and mine is on the money,''' Newman says, his eyes gleaming. ``I
get them to bet me a hundred bucks. Then they say, `But how can we
check?' And I say, `Well, you can call that time number at the
Naval Observatory.' They say, `Well, how can we get that number?'
 &HT;    ``And I say, `It's (202) 762-140l.'''
 &HT;    Newman settles back with a chuckle.
 &HT;    ``Of course they hand over the hundred bucks without even
bothering to call,'' he says. ``They know they've been hustled.''
 &HT;    Newman's cheerfully down-to-earth manner reflects his demeanour
on movie sets, where he's famous for his professionalism, his
absence of star attitude and his pleasure in the collaborative
camaraderie of movie-making.
 &HT;    ``I think of it as a community,'' he says. ``The best work
always comes out of exploring, inventing and imagining together.
Even out of terrible ideas you get some wonderful moments. My
philosophy is, if it isn't fun to get up in the morning and go to
the set, then why the hell do it?
 &HT;    ``I like to play around between scenes,'' he admits, ``but five
minutes before the cameras roll I want to make sure everything has
quieted down. You've got to exercise discipline and let everybody
know the horseplay is over and it's time to work.''
 &HT;    The focus of ``Where the Money Is'' may be his character's one
last bank job, but that didn't keep him from doing the research
necessary to fake a stroke convincingly.
 &HT;    ``I went to a rehabilitation hospital,'' he says, ``and spent
some time with stroke victims. You watch them, observe them, as you
would any other person you want to put up on the screen.''
 &HT;    He's done that dozens of times, in the process creating a
gallery of memorable characters whom the public adores, sometimes
to the point of confusing them with Newman himself.
 &HT;    ``That doesn't have anything to do with me,'' the actor says.
``The things I say are written for me, all those great one-liners.
The lady who is co-starring with you has been instructed by the
director to fall in love with you in front of the camera. The real
Paul Newman is not what you see on the screen.''
 &HT;    That distinction isn't always clear to his fans, he adds.
 &HT;    ``Right after I did Rocky Graziano in `Somebody Up There Likes
Me' (1956),'' he recalls, ``I went with a bunch of people to have a
few beers down on Second Avenue. Guys would walk up and smack me on
the shoulder and say, `You think you're so tough? You think you're
a boxer?'
 &HT;    ``Then, after `The Color of Money,' I'd be in a bar with a pool
table and somebody would say, `How about a little game? We don't
have to play for money, what would you like to play for?'
 &HT;    ``I'd say, `How about your house?''' Newman says with a laugh.
``That usually ended the conversation.''
 &HT;    More recently, he adds, he may have alienated some of his fans
without really meaning to.
 &HT;    ``I cut my finger slicing some green peppers,'' he says. ``It
was really bad, bleeding pretty profusely. So I hopped on my motor
scooter and went down to the hospital. The doctor fixed it up and
said, `I want you to keep that finger elevated. Hold it up in the
air.'
 &HT;    ``Well,'' he says with a grin, ``it happened to be my middle
finger. So as I walked out of the emergency room holding my middle
finger up, people were looking at me like, `Why is Paul Newman
doing that to us?'''
 &HT;    Newman is making fewer films nowadays, feeling that at this
stage in his career he can afford to be selective. ``Where the
Money Is'' provides his first starring role since ``Twilight''
(1998), and is his first film since a supporting turn in ``Message
in a Bottle'' (1999). Instead, he's devoting more time to Newman's
Own, the food-products line through which he raises money for
several charities.
 &HT;    ``If someone had told me 20 years ago that I'd have my face on a
bottle of salad dressing, I'd have had them committed,'' the actor
says. ``I'm glad that the money goes for good causes. I don't
exactly live low on the hog, so I can afford it.
 &HT;    ``I think it's better to give it away in your lifetime,'' he
adds, ``so you can see the benefits. I don't understand people who
hoard their fortunes and give them away after they're gone.''
 &HT;    Newman's other passion remains driving fast cars _ which in
January led to a serious accident at the practice run for the
Daytona 500.
 &HT;    ``Bad judgment,'' he says matter-of-factly. ``But I'd rather
drive at Daytona than on I-95. It's safer there than on the freeway
_ at least you're pretty sure the guy in front of you isn't going
to do something stupid. I may do something stupid, but that leaves
the guy behind me out of luck.''
 &HT;    There aren't a lot of 75-year-olds out racing cars, but Newman
says that his durability there, like his longevity as an actor, is
simply a matter of luck.
 &HT;    ``I'm just very fortunate that my body hasn't abandoned me
yet,'' he says after a moment's thought. ``That's the luck of the
draw. If you're born with the right metabolism, you're just
lucky.''
 &HT;    A lot of actors say they hope to work until their dying day, but
Newman freely admits that he expects to retire fairly soon.
 &HT;    ``I've talked about it,'' he says. ``In fact, I think I've been
retiring every year for the past 15 years. I'd like to do one more
great film that would be my swan song _ a film with my wife Joanne
or Robert Redford or Tom Cruise. I'd love to find a really
memorable film to go out on.
 &HT;    ``At some point you have to get out,'' Newman says. ``I don't
want to retire on my knees.''

A MATTER OF TIME: JAMES CAVIEZEL STARS IN `FREQUENCY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of James Caviezel in a scene from
``Frequency.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    James Caviezel has ``The Twilight Zone'' on the brain.
 &HT;    ``I remember the one where they don't show the girl's face and
she's getting plastic surgery to look like one of the pig people,''
Caviezel says. ``I remember the one with the boy sending everyone
out to the corn, and I remember the one with this woman who would
never die, who'd stick a beetle on you and age you. That one got
me.''
 &HT;    Caviezel, the intense young actor whose credits include ``My Own
Private Idaho'' (1991), ``Wyatt Earp'' (1993), Terrence Malick's
``The Thin Red Line'' (1998) and Ang Lee's ``Ride with the Devil''
(1999), has an appetite for the weird.
 &HT;    ``I believe in a lot of that,'' he says. ``There are so many
solar systems. I wouldn't hesitate to think there are other
civilizations out there. There are a lot of apparitions that
happen, that have been happening for centuries.
 &HT;    ``I wouldn't put any limitations on God,'' he adds. ``Part of me
wants to believe. It gives me hope.''
 &HT;    Caviezel's latest film, ``Frequency,'' is all about sci-fi and
hope. It's also about father-son bonding, a serial killer and
hearing dead people.
 &HT;    Caviezel stars as John Sullivan, a somber New York cop whose
firefighter father, Frank (Dennis Quaid), died nearly 30 years ago
in a blaze. One night, however, a freak atmospheric phenomenon
allows John to communicate with Frank via ham radio, with John in
1999 and Frank in 1969, one day before his date with destiny.
 &HT;    Hoping to save his father's life, John warns him about what is
to come, and inadvertently triggers a series of unpredictable
consequences _ including murder _ which threatens to throw history
as we know it completely out of whack.
 &HT;    ``The film is a number of things, and everybody is going to see
something different,'' the soft-spoken actor says during an
interview at New York's Regency Hotel. Caviezel is sporting
dark-brown hair, a scruffy beard, black-rimmed plastic glasses and
a gray sports coat over a camelhair vest.
 &HT;    ``It was the father-son relationship that drove me to want to do
it,'' he explains, ``and that's set in the trappings of a
sci-fi/suspense thriller. What I liked, in reading it, was how the
genres switched.
 &HT;    ``The last time I saw a movie like that was `Life Is Beautiful'
(1998),'' he adds. ``Who, going into it, knew the Holocaust would
emerge from the beginnings of a love affair? That combination
weaved together very nicely, and I thought `Frequency' did the same
kind of thing.''
 &HT;    Given his affection for sci-fi and an abiding belief in God, the
31-year-old actor didn't find it hard to make his character or the
situation feel real.
 &HT;    ``Regardless of any religious affiliation, if you have some sort
of belief in the unknown, that there's something out there ... I
have that element in me,'' Caviezel says, ``and I used that. I
think films like `Frequency' or `Ghost' (1990) or `The Sixth Sense'
(1999) have an element that people want to believe. They want to
believe in the hereafter.
 &HT;    ``I just used the ham radio and the aurora borealis in
`Frequency' as a metaphor for that,'' he says. ``When you lose
somebody you love _ and my father had a near-miss with death after
open-heart surgery _ you look back and think of all the things you
wish you had done.
 &HT;    ``Here, it's great to go to a film and fantasize about that,''
he adds. ``Would you change paths? Would you do things that may
cause severe consequences?''
 &HT;    For himself, he says, he doubts that he'd change anything.
 &HT;    ``I don't think I would,'' he says thoughtfully. ``Everything
happens for a reason. I believe in the theory that life gives you a
lemon and you can turn it into lemonade. Even the bad things that
happen in our lives, good things can happen from them.
 &HT;    ``Learning can be that way at times, but there are a lot of
benefits from it,'' the actor says. ``It's kind of like working out
_ I don't particularly enjoy it, but it's great when I hit that
shower.'
 &HT;    Caviezel's take on acting is equally colorful. The two elements
that he most appreciates, he says, are those moments when he
connects with a fellow actor and the opportunity to touch
moviegoers in a darkened theater.
 &HT;    ``I know when I see movies I get something from watching an
actor on screen,'' he says. ``Even before I became an actor, I felt
that. That's pretty powerful.
 &HT;    ``So I enjoy going to theaters and seeing people react,''
Caviezel says. ``(A performance) is something I can give to
someone, and it's very fulfilling for me. I see acting as a
service.''
 &HT;    Caviezel, who grew up in the state of Washington, where he still
lives with his wife, began acting in the early 1990s, first as a
guest star on such television shows as ``The Wonder Years.'' Later
he made his movie debut with a small role in Gus Van Sant's ``My
Own Private Idaho.'' Bigger roles in bigger films followed, among
them ``Ed'' (1996) and ``G.I. Jane'' (1997).
 &HT;    Slowly but steadily, he's climbed the Hollywood ladder. But,
while proud of his accomplishments, Caviezel cringes when he sees
the ``Frequency'' publicity, which has his and Quaid's names above
the title _ tangible proof that he's finally achieved stardom.
 &HT;    ``I don't really think about it,'' he says. ``Whenever the
agents say, `We're going to get your name above the title,' I say,
`Just make the movie good.'
 &HT;    ``To me, the film business, what I do, is a service,'' he adds.
``Being where I'm at is such a miracle anyway. I was a basketball
player _ I went to movies, and I felt this real strong calling
inside that said, `You're supposed to be an actor.' I talked to my
dad, and he said, `You don't want to get into that crap.' I said,
`Yeah, yeah. You're right.'
 &HT;    ``Through a twist of fate _ what if? _ I broke my foot,'' he
recalls. ``My college coach said, `You always screw around doing
these impersonations. Why don't you go talk to the drama
teacher?'''
 &HT;    Caviezel shrugs.
 &HT;    ``It just happened that way,'' he says. ``So many times I wanted
to quit. I just can't believe I'm here sometimes.
 &HT;    ``I hope I always feel that way,'' Caviezel adds. ``It keeps me
grounded. I have great family. I have people who tell me things I
might not want to hear, but that I ought to hear. That's important.
 &HT;    ``So the simple things are the things that I don't ever want to
lose,'' he concludes. ``I saw that in Terrence Malick. He will
always be my father in film. It's good to have a mentor like him in
the film business, because he kind of holds you accountable.''
 &HT;    Caviezel will next turn up in the family boat-racing drama
``Madison'' and then the uplifting ``Pay It Forward'' with Kevin
Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment.
 &HT;    But while he may be on a roll, he's clearly struggling with his
newfound stardom. Fortunately, he got some advice from another
reluctant star that still rings loud and clear.
 &HT;    ``Jimmy Stewart told me, `This is a service. If you serve people
and look at it from that point of view, you will always find it
fulfilling,''' he says. ``People ask if acting is noble. It is
noble to serve.''
 &HT;    Jimmy Stewart?
 &HT;    ``It was 1991,'' Caviezel says, smiling sheepishly. ``I was at
(producer) Jerry Weintraub's house.
 &HT;    ``I was a waiter.''

 (Includes a color slide of Bruce Willis with David Schwimmer in a
scene from ``Friends.'') 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not for release in Canada until 23 April. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes even friends need friends.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Matthew Perry, who recently invited a pal to drop by
and guest-star on a few ``Friends'' episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox Arquette and company didn't complain
too much _ after all, Perry's friend was big-screen superstar Bruce
Willis.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing Willis, with whom he made the current box-office smash
``The Whole Nine Yards,'' has given Perry a whole new perspective
on life in the spotlight. For the first few years of ``Friends,''
the young actor found himself uncomfortable with his own
popularity. It was last year, during the making of ``The Whole Nine
Yards,'' that he found a new comfort level.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it kind of goes in waves,'' Perry says. ``When we
first started being in the public eye, I was the one who just loved
it. In that first season, I was going to malls, humming the theme
song, hoping to get recognized ... Later, the attention was too
much. Now, I'm just used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry's newfound ease is well-timed, considering his current
status as a genuine movie star. Released several weeks back, ``The
Whole Nine Yards'' came from virtually nowhere to become one of
this year's biggest feature hits, holding the No. 1 box-office spot
against all comers for three straight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He may have achieved stardom on ``Friends,'' but Perry admits he
was a little nervous about acting alongside Willis, who _ though he
also got his start on television, as co-star of ``Moonlighting''
(1985-1989) _ has been one of Hollywood's top international stars
since ``Die Hard'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the first big star that I've worked with,'' Perry says,
``so I was kind of intimidated. I wasn't sure how the dynamic would
work, but he got a kick out of being funny again.''
</P>
<P>
   He got a taste of Willis' notoriously jocular humor even before
filming began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me before I accepted the part and left a message on
my machine _ `Hey, Matthew. Call me back or I'll burn your house
down!,''' Perry recalls. ``It was funny. I called him back _ I was
pacing all over my house talking to him _ and, by the end, we were
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Good enough friends, in fact, that he was able to convince
Willis to pay a return visit, guest-starring in a three-week arc of
``Friends,'' starting April 27, as the stern widower father of a
20-year-old young lady who happens to be dating Ross (David
Schwimmer).
</P>
<P>
   This sort of stunt-cast ratings trick has worked well for
``Friends'' in the past _ previous guest stars have included Julia
Roberts, George Clooney, Noah Wyle and Brooke Shields _ and it
demonstrates that the show's producers still know how to keep
things interesting.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Perry says he believes that ``Friends'' is fresher than
ever in this, its seventh season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have more momentum this season than ever before,''
he says matter-of-factly, relaxing on a beat-up sofa on the
``Friends'' set. ``I think the show has always been good. There's
just been a certain dynamic in the press to build it up, then tear
it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like that with `Seinfeld,''' he adds. ``All of a
sudden, people were saying `Seinfeld' was terrible in its fifth
year. But it wasn't _ it was the same show.''
</P>
<P>
   He blames that same negativity for the way the media has
approached those ``Friends'' stars who have made feature-film
forays. Aside from Kudrow, who won critical plaudits in ``The
Opposite of Sex'' (1998) and ``Analyze This'' (1999), and Cox
Arquette's role in the ensemble ``Scream'' films, the press has
generally lacerated the movie work of the ``Friends'' cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little unfair,'' says Perry, who prior to ``The Whole
Nine Yards'' had appeared in such misfires as ``Fools Rush In''
(1996) and ``Almost Heroes'' (1998). ``I think there is a bit of,
`A David Schwimmer movie must do better, because he's on TV all the
time.' It doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Passing by, Perry's co-star and on-camera romantic interest
Courteney Cox Arquette agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who just do movies can have failures and it's OK,'' she
says. ``But with us it's, like, `Whoa! Another Friend bites the
dust! Keep your day job!'''
</P>
<P>
   That day job has been hopping lately, with the ongoing romance
between Chandler (Perry) and longtime pal Monica (Cox Arquette)
keeping fans in a tizzy. However, Perry cautions that viewers
shouldn't necessarily expect to see the two live happily ever
after.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the secret these days to a successful TV show is
to keep people unhappy,'' Perry says with Chandler-esque
resignation. ``You don't want to see a happy couple. If you just
had Monica and Chandler in love, staring at the stars, people
aren't going to watch that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he turned 30 only a few months ago, Perry is actually
the seasoned acting veteran of the ``Friends'' cast, having been
working steadily since the 1987 Fox sitcom ``Second Chance.'' He
admits that it's tough playing the same character week in and week
out, but claims that taping in front of a live audience is what
gives ``Friends'' that extra boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps a lot,'' he says. ``I mean, we've done a silly amount
of shows, more than 130 shows or something. And we still get
nervous before the show, which is cool. The day I don't get nervous
before the show is the day I probably shouldn't be here anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get in there and you hear the laughter,'' he adds,
``your performance just comes up. It's like putting on a different
one-act play every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry isn't contenting himself with merely playing Chandler,
either. He wrote one of this season's episodes of ``Friends,'' and
is developing a pilot for ABC, called ``The Shrink.'' As if that
weren't enough, the success of ``The Whole Nine Yards'' has left
him fielding a slew of film offers for his next summer hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   If everything falls into place, who knows? He might wind up as
famous as his friend Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   If he does, though, Perry says he can handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good far outweighs the bad,'' he says with a shrug. ``Now,
if there's a guy outside my house taking pictures, I don't have to
panic about it. People aren't chasing us around anymore _ they're
chasing around the new 18-or-19-year-old stars.''

BORN TO DIRECT? SOPHIA COPPOLA STEERS `THE VIRGIN SUICIDES'

 (Includes a color slide of Sophia Coppola directing Kirsten Dunst
in a scene from ``The Virgin Suicides.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Sofia Coppola began studying filmmaking as a preschooler.
 &HT;    ``At age 4, I was in the Philippines hanging out on the set of
`Apocalypse Now' (1979),'' says the daughter of legendary director
Francis Ford Coppola. ``I remember being helicoptered into the
jungle. It was like one great big adventure.''
 &HT;    Her education continued on the set of ``The Godfather, Part
III'' (1990), which Coppola calls ``my acting debut and one of the
most uncomfortable times of my life. Let's just say the critics
were harsh.''
 &HT;    Her graduate school was watching her father deal with bankruptcy
and what seemed at the time like the end of his Hollywood career.
 &HT;    ``I learned from him that, no matter what, you never give up,''
Coppola says. ``I never remember my father losing faith in his art
_ I don't remember him ever being discouraged.''
 &HT;    And now Coppola has stepped into the arena herself, writing and
directing a big-screen adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' cult novel
``The Virgin Suicides,'' the story of three death-obsessed sisters
in 1970s Michigan and the neighborhood boys who are obsessed with
them.
 &HT;    To help get her first major film, which will open April 21, to
the big screen, Coppola recruited an impressive, eclectic cast that
includes Danny DeVito, Kathleen Turner, James Woods, Kirsten Dunst,
Josh Harnett and Giovanni Ribisi.
 &HT;    The only name in the credits that didn't seem to belong was her
own, she says, since previously the only thing she had directed was
a short for the Bravo cable channel.
 &HT;    ``Of course, the name Coppola gets you in the door,'' says the
novice director, who is also the cousin of Nicolas Cage and the
niece of Talia Shire. ``You can get the assignment. But from then
on you really have to prove yourself.''
 &HT;    Since first reading the book, she had sensed that ``The Virgin
Suicides'' would be that proving-ground.
 &HT;    ``It's not often that you fall in love with a piece of
literature,'' she says. ``In my own mind, I was almost picturing
the movie as I read it.''
 &HT;    But a film adaptation was already in the works at another
studio, with another director. Nonetheless, Coppola jotted down a
few ideas. A year later, she began tinkering with a script ``for
the fun of it.''
 &HT;    Suddenly, however, the other studio dropped its plans, and
Coppola was able to acquire the rights.
 &HT;    ``I almost couldn't believe it,'' she says. ``Honestly, I felt
like I was meant to do this story.''
 &HT;    Still, the decision to direct it herself was difficult.
 &HT;    ``I was so close to the material that I couldn't imagine anyone
else directing it,'' she says. ``But still, the first day we shot
in Toronto, I was very nervous. Driving to the set, my biggest fear
was that I was going to suddenly freeze up and the cast would look
at me and say, `So what should we do?'
 &HT;    ``In my nightmare scenario, I would go blank and everyone would
say, `Replace her.'''
 &HT;    Even though the film was being produced by Francis Ford
Coppola's American Zoetrope, there was one place she didn't turn
for help.
 &HT;    ``It would have been so easy to pick up a phone and say, `Dad,
what should I do?''' Coppola says.
 &HT;    ``I am guilty of trying to remember all the advice he had given
me over the years,'' she admits. ``For instance, on many sets he
told me that good directors do not stand by the video camera and
watch the takes. He told me that you sit right next to the camera,
so you are connected with the actors.
 &HT;    ``My father feels you distance yourself if you're absorbed with
a video monitor.''
 &HT;    She didn't take all his advice, though.
 &HT;    ``I remember him telling me to sit down and try to nap between
shots,'' Coppola says. ``Sorry, Dad, I just couldn't do that on my
set. We shot this movie in 29 days _ there wasn't time to sit
down.''
 &HT;    Complicating matters was that she had recently been married to
another first-time director, Spike Jonze, who was then making
``Being John Malkovich'' (1999).
 &HT;    ``We both shot our first movies at the same time,'' Coppola
recalls. ``In a way it was bad, because we were newlyweds and these
movies were taking over our lives. But we could understand what the
other person was thinking and feeling _ we would comfort each other
during the rough moments.''
 &HT;    All the more ironic, then, that as a child growing up in Napa
Valley, Calif., Coppola never planned on a career in filmmaking.
After seeing her father's struggles, she wanted to be a painter.
 &HT;    Her father thought she should try acting, however, and when
Winona Ryder dropped out of ``The Godfather, Part III,'' the
director hired his daughter to make her screen debut _ one which
became one of the most panned in Hollywood history.
 &HT;    ``I was 18, and it was one of the most uncomfortable times in my
life,'' Coppola admits. ``I didn't read every single review, but I
read a lot of them. I was aware of the criticism, and frankly I
thought it was unfair.
 &HT;    ``First of all, it was so harsh,'' she says, wincing. ``Can you
imagine being so young and having them pick on what your face looks
like in a close-up?
 &HT;    ``I wasn't totally devastated, because I wasn't preparing to
become some great actress,'' she concludes. ``I got slammed, but I
could rationalize it and think, `So what? This was an experiment.
And at least I'll never say that I didn't try it.'''
 &HT;    Afterwards, Coppola dabbled in clothing design.
 &HT;    ``I didn't know what I wanted to do,'' she says. ``I knew I was
interested in film, but it was too daunting to admit to myself that
I wanted to be a director.''
 &HT;    Nowadays, she's willing to admit it. In fact, she's already
writing her next project, which she hopes to direct next year.
 &HT;    ``It's been a crazy year,'' she says with a laugh. ``I finished
the mix on my movie the night before our wedding. Any other groom
would have been really mad that his bride was so occupied. My
future husband completely understood.
 &HT;    ``He did his mix right after our honeymoon!''
 &HT;    Jonze's new father-in-law also understood.
 &HT;    ``My father is an inspiration to both of us,'' Coppola says. ``I
just hope to have my father's enthusiasm when I'm his age. My
father will still come home from a set completely excited about
what he learned about moviemaking on that particular day. It's
still a grand adventure for him.''
 &HT;    And, yes, she's still eager to win his approval.
 &HT;    ``To tell you the truth,'' she says, ``my most nerve-wracking
moment is when I sent my father the script I wrote for `The Virgin
Suicides.'''
 &HT;    The next day the phone rang, and the novice screenwriter's heart
was in her throat.
 &HT;    ``He didn't even give me a note or a suggestion,'' Coppola says.
``My dad simply said, `You should make this film. This is the kind
of movie I want to do someday, too.'
 &HT;    ``I couldn't get a better compliment.''

 GOVERNING IN CYBERSPACE, DYSON IS NO POLITICIAN  
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Esther Dyson was presiding over the most recent meeting of
Icann, the controversial international group that is trying to
create the Internet's first democracy. While she sat on a stage
facing an audience of several hundred, her frustration and
impatience grew increasingly apparent, as people filed to a
microphone in the aisle to voice their complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Many opposed the interim board's proposal to elect permanent
members through an indirect process. But Dyson, the interim
chairwoman, defended the policy of using an electoral council
instead of letting the world's Internet users vote directly for
their board representatives. That was the best way, she told the
group, to prevent the nomination of ``people who are stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, after seeing her remark on The New York Times Web
page, Dyson took exception. ``Out of context,'' she said. ``I might
have said it, but it was out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her intention, the remark put Dyson directly at odds
with some of the same civil liberties groups that have long been
among her staunchest supporters. And the incident last month in
Cairo, Egypt, made clear that despite her unofficial titles of
doyenne of cyberspace and queen of the digerati, a politician is
one thing that Dyson is not.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly two years since Dyson was chosen to be
interim head of Icann _ Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers _ with the mandate of leading the Clinton administration's
effort to move oversight of the network from federal contractors to
the international Internet community.
</P>
<P>
   But she has ruled Icann's fractious public meetings with a mix
of impatience, frustration and condescension. And the paucity of
diplomacy, some Internet executives say, has played a role in
Icann's rocky start. Among the missteps, two of the group's
earliest decisions _ to hold closed meetings and to levy a $1 tax
on Internet addresses _ were later rescinded under pressure from
the administration and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what you see sometimes is that she doesn't quite
have the common touch,'' said Mike Godwin, a lawyer who worked with
Dyson in the early 1990s at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a
public interest group devoted to the defense of free speech and
civil rights on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there is a dimension of being a political being
that involves going out and getting hands on and dealing with
individuals,'' said Godwin, who is now senior legal editor of
E-Commerce Law Weekly, a print publication. ``I don't think she is
terribly comfortable with that. I think she is democratic in
principle but not entirely democratic in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week at her cluttered office in New York,
on a rare day when she was not traveling, Dyson defended her
leadership style. ``I don't have a tolerance for having my time
wasted; I'm straightforward,'' she said. ``It's not a question of
intelligence; it's a question of appropriateness.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most who know Esther Dyson say she does not suffer fools
gladly. But she was picked to head Icann not for her tact but
because of her international reputation for independence, integrity
and straightforward manner.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 foot 3 and 47 years of age, Dyson is a wiry, almost elfin
figure, with seeming disregard for the trappings of makeup and
fashion. She keeps her hair short and simply cut. She scurries
around her office and official meetings wearing socks without
shoes. And she often wears faded blue jeans, typically accompanied
by an oversized T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of the renowned physicist Freeman Dyson, she is
described by another Electronic Frontier Foundation colleague, John
Gilmore, as having ``formidable intelligence.'' But Dyson's fast
mind can manifest itself in ways that may come across as dismissive
and condescending.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not a people person,'' said Jerry Michalski. For five
years, Michalski wrote Release 1.0, the influential technology
newsletter that Dyson's company, EDventure holdings, publishes
monthly. Michalski left about two years ago to become a freelance
consultant and speaker, a decision made in part, he explained, by
the emotional wall that he said she kept between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``She likes humans,'' he said. ``She just doesn't do small talk.
If you hang out with her, it feels awkward. If you start talking
about feelings, she will turn around and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her interpersonal skills, over the last 20 years Dyson
has cultivated long-standing relationships with a wide circle of
some of the most influential people in the computer and Internet
industries.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Harvard with a bachelor's degree in economics,
Dyson began her career in the computer world in the 1970s, covering
the budding industry as a reporter for Forbes magazine. From there
she moved to Wall Street as an analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 she formed her venture capital firm after buying a
computer industry newsletter that she renamed Release 1.0. With
that newsletter came a related annual conference, which she has
parlayed into an invitation-only event, called PC Forum, that the
industry's top executives and digerati are afraid to miss _ even at
a registration fee of $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson is also on the board of numerous companies and nonprofit
groups around the world and has become a mainstay at Internet
conferences and policy panels. And she has positioned herself as a
well-paid, highly sought speaker.
</P>
<P>
   As former chairman, and now vice chairman, of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, she espoused some of the earliest predictions
about the complex challenges the Internet would pose for
intellectual property and privacy. And she has served on special
federal commissions on intellectual property, privacy and
encryption.
</P>
<P>
   In her role as a civil libertarian, however, Dyson is more of an
observer, a thinker, than an activist, according to people who know
her well, who say she seems more comfortable with identifying tough
issues than taking on the hard fight to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly that limitation drew criticism to her 1997 book,
``Release 2.0: A Design for Living in the Digital Age,'' which some
critics derided as a naive collection of only sometimes interesting
observations.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lambert, reviewing the book for Business Week, said
Dyson ``glosses over the obstacles that lie in the way'' of
achieving the ``electronic Utopia she foresees.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Dyson talks, people in the digital world listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Esther starts talking about something, and you don't know
why, you better start paying attention,'' said Miljenko Horvak, a
former Citibank executive who is involved in several Eastern
European start-up companies with Dyson. For instance, Horvak said,
Dyson started talking about online privacy five years ago, well
before it became a cause celebre.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this thing that I call Esther's orbit,'' Horvak said.
``She, by the gravitational pull of her personality and her person
get all of these different kinds of people to be in orbit around
her.''
</P>
<P>
   And that ``pull,'' Horvak says, does not involve charisma or
charm. But finding someone to say anything more critical for public
attribution is nearly impossible. ``Can we go off the record?'' is
the first thing many people said when asked to comment for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   As one acquaintance put it: ``People are afraid to say bad
things about Esther. Not because she is not a nice person, or out
of fear of retribution from her, but because they think it will
cast negatively on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Icann controversy is the issue of electing half
of the 18-member board. Originally the voting was to be complete by
the end of this September, but it is now not expected to be
finished until sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as some blame Dyson for not being a better leader and
problem solver, many give her credit for dedicating the time
necessary to keep the very fragile Icann experiment from blowing up
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cochetti, who as a policy executive with IBM helped select
Dyson as Icann's interim chairwoman, said the decision was not
based on the assumption that she had a unique insight into the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably about 1,000 people in the world who are as
insightful about the Internet as Esther,'' Cochetti said. ``People
may disagree with Esther, and they may disagree with either her
substance or her tactics, but it's rare _ if ever _ that anyone has
ever questioned her integrity,'' he said. ``She is a person who
from my experience operates from her principle. You can rely on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before taking on the Icann duties, Dyson was spending 70
percent to 80 percent of her life on the road, attending her
different board meetings and conferences and overseeing the
personal investments she has in some 30 technology companies around
the world _ many of them obscure ventures in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Her Icann work comes atop this heavy load. And the strain of the
group's highly contentious process shows during Icann's public
forums, which are purposely held in a different country each time _
and at which Dyson has become increasingly curt to the people who
line up at the microphones to challenge proposed policies or
question the group's procedures.
</P>
<P>
   It is because Dyson has built a career as a seeming voice for
the little guy, the individual user of digital technology, that
some people in the electronic libertarian community say they feel a
bit abandoned by Dyson in the Icann process.
</P>
<P>
   They cite an episode last fall, when a coalition of nonprofit
groups traveled to Chile for an Icann board meeting. The group
asked the board to slow its policy-making until Icann had
representation from noncommercial interests and individuals. As
critics lined up to question how Icann, for example, had arrived at
its business-backed policy for cracking down on so-called
cybersquatters, Dyson's growing irritation became evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect,'' she told the audience, ``we are less
interested in complaints about the process'' and more interested in
``doing real work and moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the case of last month's meeting in Cairo, Dyson and the
rest of the board at first resisted demands from powerful groups
like Common Cause and the Center for Democracy and Technology that
they reconsider the election plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, despite Dyson's ``people who are stupid'' remark,
the interim board listened and agreed to allow direct election of
the new members. But it remains unclear whether the hostilities
will dissipate and the board will again attempt to work closely
with the civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson admits that Icann has made mistakes. But she said she was
not sure how she might have made things work better. ``Could I have
been more forceful in raising some of things that I think were
mistakes?'' she said. ``I don't know. It might have worked and it
might have backfired.''
</P>
<P>
   And many of her critics and her supporters agree that, whatever
the shortcomings, she has credibly performed a thankless job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone could have done it any better than Esther
has,'' Godwin said. ``It's to Esther's credit that Icann hasn't
been laughed out of existence.''

 GOVERNING IN CYBERSPACE, DYSON IS NO POLITICIAN  
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Esther Dyson was presiding over the most recent meeting of
Icann, the controversial international group that is trying to
create the Internet's first democracy. While she sat on a stage
facing an audience of several hundred, her frustration and
impatience grew increasingly apparent, as people filed to a
microphone in the aisle to voice their complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Many opposed the interim board's proposal to elect permanent
members through an indirect process. But Dyson, the interim
chairwoman, defended the policy of using an electoral council
instead of letting the world's Internet users vote directly for
their board representatives. That was the best way, she told the
group, to prevent the nomination of ``people who are stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, after seeing her remark on The New York Times Web
page, Dyson took exception. ``Out of context,'' she said. ``I might
have said it, but it was out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her intention, the remark put Dyson directly at odds
with some of the same civil liberties groups that have long been
among her staunchest supporters. And the incident last month in
Cairo, Egypt, made clear that despite her unofficial titles of
doyenne of cyberspace and queen of the digerati, a politician is
one thing that Dyson is not.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly two years since Dyson was chosen to be
interim head of Icann _ Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers _ with the mandate of leading the Clinton administration's
effort to move oversight of the network from federal contractors to
the international Internet community.
</P>
<P>
   But she has ruled Icann's fractious public meetings with a mix
of impatience, frustration and condescension. And the paucity of
diplomacy, some Internet executives say, has played a role in
Icann's rocky start. Among the missteps, two of the group's
earliest decisions _ to hold closed meetings and to levy a $1 tax
on Internet addresses _ were later rescinded under pressure from
the administration and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what you see sometimes is that she doesn't quite
have the common touch,'' said Mike Godwin, a lawyer who worked with
Dyson in the early 1990s at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a
public interest group devoted to the defense of free speech and
civil rights on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there is a dimension of being a political being
that involves going out and getting hands on and dealing with
individuals,'' said Godwin, who is now senior legal editor of
E-Commerce Law Weekly, a print publication. ``I don't think she is
terribly comfortable with that. I think she is democratic in
principle but not entirely democratic in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week at her cluttered office in New York,
on a rare day when she was not traveling, Dyson defended her
leadership style. ``I don't have a tolerance for having my time
wasted; I'm straightforward,'' she said. ``It's not a question of
intelligence; it's a question of appropriateness.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most who know Esther Dyson say she does not suffer fools
gladly. But she was picked to head Icann not for her tact but
because of her international reputation for independence, integrity
and straightforward manner.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 foot 3 and 47 years of age, Dyson is a wiry, almost elfin
figure, with seeming disregard for the trappings of makeup and
fashion. She keeps her hair short and simply cut. She scurries
around her office and official meetings wearing socks without
shoes. And she often wears faded blue jeans, typically accompanied
by an oversized T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of the renowned physicist Freeman Dyson, she is
described by another Electronic Frontier Foundation colleague, John
Gilmore, as having ``formidable intelligence.'' But Dyson's fast
mind can manifest itself in ways that may come across as dismissive
and condescending.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not a people person,'' said Jerry Michalski. For five
years, Michalski wrote Release 1.0, the influential technology
newsletter that Dyson's company, EDventure holdings, publishes
monthly. Michalski left about two years ago to become a freelance
consultant and speaker, a decision made in part, he explained, by
the emotional wall that he said she kept between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``She likes humans,'' he said. ``She just doesn't do small talk.
If you hang out with her, it feels awkward. If you start talking
about feelings, she will turn around and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her interpersonal skills, over the last 20 years Dyson
has cultivated long-standing relationships with a wide circle of
some of the most influential people in the computer and Internet
industries.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Harvard with a bachelor's degree in economics,
Dyson began her career in the computer world in the 1970s, covering
the budding industry as a reporter for Forbes magazine. From there
she moved to Wall Street as an analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 she formed her venture capital firm after buying a
computer industry newsletter that she renamed Release 1.0. With
that newsletter came a related annual conference, which she has
parlayed into an invitation-only event, called PC Forum, that the
industry's top executives and digerati are afraid to miss _ even at
a registration fee of $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson is also on the board of numerous companies and nonprofit
groups around the world and has become a mainstay at Internet
conferences and policy panels. And she has positioned herself as a
well-paid, highly sought speaker.
</P>
<P>
   As former chairman, and now vice chairman, of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, she espoused some of the earliest predictions
about the complex challenges the Internet would pose for
intellectual property and privacy. And she has served on special
federal commissions on intellectual property, privacy and
encryption.
</P>
<P>
   In her role as a civil libertarian, however, Dyson is more of an
observer, a thinker, than an activist, according to people who know
her well, who say she seems more comfortable with identifying tough
issues than taking on the hard fight to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly that limitation drew criticism to her 1997 book,
``Release 2.0: A Design for Living in the Digital Age,'' which some
critics derided as a naive collection of only sometimes interesting
observations.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lambert, reviewing the book for Business Week, said
Dyson ``glosses over the obstacles that lie in the way'' of
achieving the ``electronic Utopia she foresees.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Dyson talks, people in the digital world listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Esther starts talking about something, and you don't know
why, you better start paying attention,'' said Miljenko Horvak, a
former Citibank executive who is involved in several Eastern
European start-up companies with Dyson. For instance, Horvak said,
Dyson started talking about online privacy five years ago, well
before it became a cause celebre.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this thing that I call Esther's orbit,'' Horvak said.
``She, by the gravitational pull of her personality and her person
get all of these different kinds of people to be in orbit around
her.''
</P>
<P>
   And that ``pull,'' Horvak says, does not involve charisma or
charm. But finding someone to say anything more critical for public
attribution is nearly impossible. ``Can we go off the record?'' is
the first thing many people said when asked to comment for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   As one acquaintance put it: ``People are afraid to say bad
things about Esther. Not because she is not a nice person, or out
of fear of retribution from her, but because they think it will
cast negatively on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Icann controversy is the issue of electing half
of the 18-member board. Originally the voting was to be complete by
the end of this September, but it is now not expected to be
finished until sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as some blame Dyson for not being a better leader and
problem solver, many give her credit for dedicating the time
necessary to keep the very fragile Icann experiment from blowing up
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cochetti, who as a policy executive with IBM helped select
Dyson as Icann's interim chairwoman, said the decision was not
based on the assumption that she had a unique insight into the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably about 1,000 people in the world who are as
insightful about the Internet as Esther,'' Cochetti said. ``People
may disagree with Esther, and they may disagree with either her
substance or her tactics, but it's rare _ if ever _ that anyone has
ever questioned her integrity,'' he said. ``She is a person who
from my experience operates from her principle. You can rely on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before taking on the Icann duties, Dyson was spending 70
percent to 80 percent of her life on the road, attending her
different board meetings and conferences and overseeing the
personal investments she has in some 30 technology companies around
the world _ many of them obscure ventures in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Her Icann work comes atop this heavy load. And the strain of the
group's highly contentious process shows during Icann's public
forums, which are purposely held in a different country each time _
and at which Dyson has become increasingly curt to the people who
line up at the microphones to challenge proposed policies or
question the group's procedures.
</P>
<P>
   It is because Dyson has built a career as a seeming voice for
the little guy, the individual user of digital technology, that
some people in the electronic libertarian community say they feel a
bit abandoned by Dyson in the Icann process.
</P>
<P>
   They cite an episode last fall, when a coalition of nonprofit
groups traveled to Chile for an Icann board meeting. The group
asked the board to slow its policy-making until Icann had
representation from noncommercial interests and individuals. As
critics lined up to question how Icann, for example, had arrived at
its business-backed policy for cracking down on so-called
cybersquatters, Dyson's growing irritation became evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect,'' she told the audience, ``we are less
interested in complaints about the process'' and more interested in
``doing real work and moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the case of last month's meeting in Cairo, Dyson and the
rest of the board at first resisted demands from powerful groups
like Common Cause and the Center for Democracy and Technology that
they reconsider the election plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, despite Dyson's ``people who are stupid'' remark,
the interim board listened and agreed to allow direct election of
the new members. But it remains unclear whether the hostilities
will dissipate and the board will again attempt to work closely
with the civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson admits that Icann has made mistakes. But she said she was
not sure how she might have made things work better. ``Could I have
been more forceful in raising some of things that I think were
mistakes?'' she said. ``I don't know. It might have worked and it
might have backfired.''
</P>
<P>
   And many of her critics and her supporters agree that, whatever
the shortcomings, she has credibly performed a thankless job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone could have done it any better than Esther
has,'' Godwin said. ``It's to Esther's credit that Icann hasn't
been laughed out of existence.''
</P>

&HT;     MERGER COSTS VENERABLE BANK ITS SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GAIL TODD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In reporting the huge bonus showered on Bank of
America chief Hugh McColl and the bank's huge layoffs since its
takeover by NationsBank of Charlotte, N.C., news articles brought
home the fact that the merger didn't accomplish its aim _ to make
money for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In the year and a half since the takeover, the bank's stock
price has fallen, then fallen again, at times hovering under half
of what it was at the time the two companies merged.
</P>
<P>
   But much more significant for San Francisco, the old Bank of
America, an institution nearly a century in the making, has
disappeared almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   During the time of the ``merger of equals,'' as it was glibly
called in 1998, I was writing a book about San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The bank and its founder, A.P. Giannini, played a thrilling part
in this city's history.
</P>
<P>
   It was Giannini who had provided banking services to poor and
immigrant families ignored by other banks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1906, after the great quake, it was Giannini who loaded his
bank's cash into a produce wagon and wheeled it away from a burning
North Beach, and it was Giannini who nine days later sat on a bench
in the smoky air lending out that same cash so San Franciscans
could rebuild their city.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Giannini and his bench is as much a part of San
Francisco legend as George Washington and the cherry tree for the
rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks that followed the takeover, the phrase merger of
equals was heard less and less often at the downtown Bank of
America headquarters, where I worked.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the managers who had been reciting that phrase
disappeared, leaving suddenly to ``pursue other interests.'' The
first to get the boot was our former chief executive, Dave Coulter.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, then not so slowly, the projects in the technology area
where I worked ebbed away, gone to Charlotte or to Chicago, another
NationsBank financial center.
</P>
<P>
   The offices around me emptied out. It was a hot job market, and
techies couldn't figure out why they should sit around doing
nothing when headhunters were ferreting them out in their cubicles
daily, waving job offers in their faces. I couldn't keep up with
the goodbye lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, I read an article which I thought at first was in
error. The writer was describing Bank of America's chief executive
sitting on the 58th floor of world headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   I thought, ``The Bank of America building only has 52 floors.''
</P>
<P>
   But as I read on, I realized the author wasn't writing about San
Francisco's Bank of America building. He was talking about
Charlotte's! The executive, of course, wasn't Dave Coulter. It was
Hugh McColl.
</P>
<P>
   The innovative plan started by Coulter that awarded stock
options to all employees, not just the company big shots, is still
going strong. But today the options are almost worthless because of
the fallen stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after 18 months, I jumped ship myself and went to work
for an Internet startup just a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the takeover, I was reminded that values other
than money must be considered: Tradition, caring for others, a
sense of one's place in the community and in history. All have
value and must be counted. What's lost cannot be recovered.

&HT;     REVAMPED GM PICKUPS GO BEYOND LOOKS 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For almost two years after Ford introduced its redesigned F-150
pickup line in 1996, people wanted to know when General Motors was
going to roll out its long-awaited and much-anticipated next
generation of full-size pickups.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of consumers thought that GM was already way overdue with
a new pickup when the restyled F-150 appeared, because another
rival, Dodge, had debuted the newest generation of its full-size
Ram pickup in 1994, a radically redesigned vehicle that took the
market by storm.
</P>
<P>
   GM finally got around to updating its full-size pickups for
model year 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that GM took its time in bringing out the updated GMC
Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado so that it could get these vehicles
just right.
</P>
<P>
   No, the styling isn't radically different from the previous
generation. GM has endured some criticism for that from people who
were awed by the dramatically different styling that Ford brought
to the new F-150 and Dodge brought to the Ram.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the fenders are a bit more round and the overall look
is considerably more modern that before, but a radical restyling of
the GM pickups really wasn't necessary. GM took the time to conduct
focus-group sessions with many of its customers before redesigning
the trucks, and found that the vast majority did not want a bold
new look for the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, GM spent the money more wisely, improving just about
every other aspect of the vehicle as well as tuning up the styling.
The result is a pickup that not only is much better than it was
before, but which also outshines its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But as good as those first redesigned (1999) models were, the
2000 models are even better.
</P>
<P>
   First on the list of improvements for this year is the optional
fourth door for the extended-cab models. For this review, we tested
a three-door model, but I can tell you after a week of driving the
Sierra that I would prefer to have the fourth door.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with the three-door is that the door is on
the passenger side. That just doesn't make sense. Statistics show
that full-size pickups have only one occupant in them about 90
percent of the time. And if the driver wants to load or unload some
inside cargo, he or she must walk around to the other side of the
truck.
</P>
<P>
   GM put the third door on the driver's side in its compact-pickup
line (the Chevy S-10, GMC Sonoma and Isuzu Hombre), and justified
that by saying that it would be more convenient for the driver to
load and unload from the driver's side. But apparently that logic
didn't carry through to the designers of the full-size pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth door costs just $728, and it's worth it. If you
choose the three-door model to save money, though, you'll have to
deal with having the third door on the passenger's side. Still,
that's better than the alternative of just a few years ago _ no
rear doors at all. And if you're using the Sierra to haul people,
they can get into and out of the back on their own.
</P>
<P>
   In that back seat, there is a lot more room for people and cargo
than you'll find in the competitors' vehicles. The door is wide
enough for easy entry and exit, too. Sierra (and Silverado) have
the largest door openings on extended-cab pickups in the full-size
pickup segment.
</P>
<P>
   GM increased power by 15 horsepower in two of the full-size
pickups' engines for 2000. The 4.8-liter Vortec V-8 is now rated at
270 horsepower, while the 5.3-liter Vortec V-8 now has 285
horsepower. Torque is up by 10 foot-pounds in each engine, too.
</P>
<P>
   Our test vehicle came with the 5.3-liter engine, which offered
plenty of smooth, responsive power for all conditions, from
around-town stop-and-go driving to high-speed cruising.
</P>
<P>
   Several safety and convenience features were added for 2000,
including programmable automatic locking and unlocking of the
doors. Drivers can customize their vehicles to lock automatically
when the truck reaches 15 mph, and to automatically unlock when
they stop and remove the keys from the ignition. These features can
be turned on or off independently, and, for security reasons, the
system can be set to lock and unlock only the driver's side door
automatically, or to lock and unlock both sides simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   We drove the two-wheel-drive 1500 model, the smallest of the
full-size GM pickups and also the one with the best ride. Still, it
does ride like a truck, no matter how carlike GM tries to make it
</P>
<P>
   The interior is the Sierra's best attribute. The extended-cab
models have a back seat that is really a seat and not some short,
ill-designed attempt at one. There is support for the thighs and
plenty of leg room. About two-thirds of pickup buyers choose
extended-cab models because they need the extra passenger space,
but only the Sierra and Silverado offer a truly practical rear
seat.
</P>
<P>
   With the changes GM made in the 1999 models, the truck's frame
is stronger than before, the V-8 engines are all new and more
powerful than ever, and even the brakes are far superior to those
of the previous GM trucks and any of the competition. Four-wheel
disc brakes are now standard across the line.
</P>
<P>
   The base engine is a 4.3-liter V-6, which is standard on two-
and four-wheel-drive 1500 models. It cranks out 200 horsepower and
260 foot-pounds of torque.

&HT;     LOCK UP THE CRAZY TV 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The other night I watched the new mental
hospital drama ``Wonderland'' with one of the toughest of critics _
a former mental patient.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC show has been praised by television critics for
realistically portraying life in a big-city emergency psychiatric
ward. It has been panned by the National Alliance of the Mentally
Ill for portraying the mentally ill as violent.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Billy, a veteran of six hospitalizations for
manic-depression, panned ``Wonderland'' for assaulting the senses,
not for assaulting the oversensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is silly. It's all people flipping out,'' Billy said.
``There's too much shouting. Mental hospitals are so quiet you can
hear the Thorazine rattling in the tiny paper cups.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy admitted he may have done some shouting, but he had
another criticism: ``Real mental hospitals are more entertaining
than this. There's a reason they're called funny farms. This one
isn't funny enough.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to stop him from telling his old stories about escaping
down the laundry chute, smoking weed in the empty seclusion room
and mobilizing the manics to vote down the chronics for control of
the TV set.
</P>
<P>
   Billy also panned the show for inducing illness _ not mental
illness, but seasickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That green lighting and jiggling camera are driving me nuts,''
he said. ``The jiggling camera is meant to make things seem
realistic, but human perception doesn't work like that. God gave us
Steadicam.''
</P>
<P>
   See what he means about crazy people, even recovered ones? They
can be very funny.
</P>
<P>
   What do we get on ``Wonderland``? In just two episodes, a
schizophrenic shot five people, a pregnant woman was stabbed in the
stomach and the killer schizophrenic committed suicide with a
fountain pen. And millions of viewers got seasick.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Thursday's show, one of the actors came on and
made a little statement about how the mentally ill are
overwhelmingly nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not on this show,'' Billy said.
</P>
<P>
   The one scene that got to Billy on Thursday's episode was when
the parents of the homicidal schizophrenic got upset at doctors
discussing their son as a ``case.'' They begged the doctors to use
their son's name.
</P>
<P>
   The show does communicate some of the torment of psychosis, and
the anguish of families seeing the madness in their loved ones'
eyes, and hearing it in their bizarre tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' does not succumb to the romantic notion that
insanity is arbitrarily determined by society and that asylums are
filled with sane people, interrupted by mind-numbing psychiatric
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to describe, to someone who has never seen it, how
terrible and intractable madness often is,'' anthropologist T.M.
Luhrmann writes in ``Of Two Minds: The Growing Disorder in American
Psychiatry.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget ``Wonderland.'' Luhrmann's book is hardly intended as
entertainment, but she describes the insane and their doctors in
marvelous novelistic detail _ and she finds the humor Billy talked
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``When psychosis is not brutally awful, it is funny, and
sometimes looking for the humor in it makes it more possible to
handle the pain of seeing a human being lose his mind,'' she writes
sorrowfully.
</P>
<P>
   Luhrmann spent years doing field work in a variety of mental
institutions, studying psychiatry the way an anthropologist would
any culture. The culture of psychiatry is unnecessarily split
between two belief systems. One would treat mental illness by
passing out pills; the other would do talk therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd never get anywhere if we didn't do both,'' said Dr. Mark
Leary, deputy chief of the psychiatry department at San Francisco
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Just as most work on the range would make lousy cowboy shows,
most mental illness would make lousy hospital shows.
</P>
<P>
   As Billy put it, ``The mentally ill are just working hard being
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Then ``Wonderland'' ended and gave way to the local news and the
story of the wacked-out bicyclist shooting it out with cops on the
Bay Bridge. Maybe it will be a future episode of ``Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   It's harder to do the stories of all the former mental patients
like Billy, who are living and working among us.

&HT;     BUICK BANKS ON RENDEZVOUS TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ When Buick rolls out its all-new Rendezvous
sport-utility vehicle next spring, it will be none too soon for Guy
Sensiba, sales manager at Cavender Buick in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Buick dealers nationwide, Cavender Buick for several
years now has had to deal almost daily with loyal customers who
want to buy another Buick product but feel the need for a
sport-utility rather than a sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Buick is the only General Motors division that has no
sport-utility or minivan product to offer longtime customers who
want to follow the consumer trend and buy a trucklike product
instead of a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had the Rendezvous right now, but at least it is on
the way and we know when it will be here,'' Sensiba said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have customers who have driven Buicks exclusively for 25
years trading them in for Chevrolet Tahoes, and there's not much we
can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He told of a longtime customer who came in just to apologize
because the man had decided to trade his wife's Buick for a Tahoe,
a full-size sport-utility. ``He said his wife liked her Buick, but
she was tired of sitting in traffic behind those big SUVs.''
</P>
<P>
   Buick dealers watched their business erode as first the minivan
and then the sport-utility craze swept America. Other GM dealers
have products to offer their customers other than traditional cars;
even Cadillac now sells a full-size SUV based on the Tahoe. Pontiac
dealers have the Montana, a combination minivan/SUV, and later this
spring will get the Aztek, a mini-SUV designed for a youthful
audience. Oldsmobile dealers have had a premium compact
sport-utility _ the Bravada (based on the Chevy Blazer) _ and the
Silhouette minivan for several years.
</P>
<P>
   At many Buick dealerships, it's rare to see anyone under age 60
shopping for a car, even though this GM division offers two
contemporary sedans that car experts widely agree are right on
target to appeal to baby boomers and consumers in their 30s: the
midsize Regal and full-size Lesabre (which is very similar to a
Toyota Camry).
</P>
<P>
   That should change with the introduction of the Rendezvous,
which will be an exclusive Buick product not shared with any other
GM division, Buick officials say.
</P>
<P>
   And it should be a hit with consumers, auto critics say, because
it takes the best of the styling and attributes of such popular
SUVs as the Lexus RX 300, Mercedes-Benz M-class and BMW X5 and
rolls them all into one affordable package.
</P>
<P>
   The Rendezvous is also a bit of history in the making: It's the
first Buick truck product in almost 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it's technically considered a truck, this is a
vehicle that maintains the kind of comfort and convenience that
consumers expect from a premium family sedan _ a blend of carlike
ride, handling and interior amenities with the versatility and
roominess of an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   That blend signifies the future of the sport-utility genre,
where the vehicles are getting much more refined and much less
trucklike while retaining the qualities that endear SUVs to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   To be introduced as a 2002 model, Rendezvous will go into
production in spring 2001. Buick dealers already have gotten a
close look _ it was shown to them in San Diego in February during
the Buick Invitational Golf Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the vehicle platform of the GM minivans such as the
Pontiac Montana, the Rendezvous will be offered with a variety of
seating arrangements that will accommodate up to seven passengers
(with the optional third seating row). Remove the third seat, and
the vehicle can be arranged to hold up to 108.9 cubic feet of cargo
_ about five-and-a-half times the capacity of a Buick Park Avenue
sedan's trunk.
</P>
<P>
   It will come either with two-wheel drive or the optional GM
Versatrak all-wheel-drive system that offers sure-footed traction
under almost all road conditions. It can be equipped to tow up to
3,500 pounds, which should make it an attractive vehicle for
consumers with boat, horse or recreational trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Why create a Buick truck after eight decades of cars? It's a
matter of survival for dealers and the brand itself, GM officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that the boomer and Generation X groups,
who tend to buy SUVs and other trucks, acknowledge there is plenty
of quality behind the Buick marquee,'' said Buick division General
Manager Roger W. Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the opportunity is there to transfer what a lot of
customers like about a Buick to a premium vehicle built according
to a brand-new formula _ highly functional, enjoyable to drive, and
highly luxurious.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendezvous will be the first SUV to combine three-row seating, a
flat load floor, all-wheel drive and independent rear suspension.
It will have a traditional Buick oval-shaped grille that marks it
immediately as a Buick product, but unlike the more garish big
Detroit luxury cars of the past, the grille will be painted rather
than chromed.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-inch-wide rear hatch opening will be wide enough to
accommodate 4-by-8-foot sheets of plywood, one of the important
benchmark standards for any contemporary truck product.
</P>
<P>
   Power will come from a 3.4-liter V-6 engine generating 185
horsepower and 210 foot-pounds of torque. A major advantage of this
engine will be the Rendezvous' fuel economy: up to 19 miles per
gallon in the city and 24 mpg on the highway with the
front-wheel-drive model, or 17 city/22 highway with all-wheel
drive. That's a huge improvement over most of today's mid- and
full-size SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Safety features will be built in throughout the vehicle,
including front and side air bags for the front-seat occupants,
safety-cage construction and four-wheel antilock disc brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury features will abound, including power-everything,
automatic climate control, advanced security systems and the
availability of GM's OnStar communications and guidance system that
uses Global Positioning System satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
   No prices have been announced yet, but Buick expects to position
the Rendezvous to compete directly against sport-utilities in the
low- to mid-$30,000s.

&HT;     MERGER COSTS VENERABLE BANK ITS SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GAIL TODD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In reporting the huge bonus showered on Bank of
America chief Hugh McColl and the bank's huge layoffs since its
takeover by NationsBank of Charlotte, N.C., news articles brought
home the fact that the merger didn't accomplish its aim _ to make
money for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In the year and a half since the takeover, the bank's stock
price has fallen, then fallen again, at times hovering under half
of what it was at the time the two companies merged.
</P>
<P>
   But much more significant for San Francisco, the old Bank of
America, an institution nearly a century in the making, has
disappeared almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   During the time of the ``merger of equals,'' as it was glibly
called in 1998, I was writing a book about San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The bank and its founder, A.P. Giannini, played a thrilling part
in this city's history.
</P>
<P>
   It was Giannini who had provided banking services to poor and
immigrant families ignored by other banks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1906, after the great quake, it was Giannini who loaded his
bank's cash into a produce wagon and wheeled it away from a burning
North Beach, and it was Giannini who nine days later sat on a bench
in the smoky air lending out that same cash so San Franciscans
could rebuild their city.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Giannini and his bench is as much a part of San
Francisco legend as George Washington and the cherry tree for the
rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks that followed the takeover, the phrase merger of
equals was heard less and less often at the downtown Bank of
America headquarters, where I worked.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the managers who had been reciting that phrase
disappeared, leaving suddenly to ``pursue other interests.'' The
first to get the boot was our former chief executive, Dave Coulter.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, then not so slowly, the projects in the technology area
where I worked ebbed away, gone to Charlotte or to Chicago, another
NationsBank financial center.
</P>
<P>
   The offices around me emptied out. It was a hot job market, and
techies couldn't figure out why they should sit around doing
nothing when headhunters were ferreting them out in their cubicles
daily, waving job offers in their faces. I couldn't keep up with
the goodbye lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, I read an article which I thought at first was in
error. The writer was describing Bank of America's chief executive
sitting on the 58th floor of world headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   I thought, ``The Bank of America building only has 52 floors.''
</P>
<P>
   But as I read on, I realized the author wasn't writing about San
Francisco's Bank of America building. He was talking about
Charlotte's! The executive, of course, wasn't Dave Coulter. It was
Hugh McColl.
</P>
<P>
   The innovative plan started by Coulter that awarded stock
options to all employees, not just the company big shots, is still
going strong. But today the options are almost worthless because of
the fallen stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after 18 months, I jumped ship myself and went to work
for an Internet startup just a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the takeover, I was reminded that values other
than money must be considered: Tradition, caring for others, a
sense of one's place in the community and in history. All have
value and must be counted. What's lost cannot be recovered.

&HT;     REVAMPED GM PICKUPS GO BEYOND LOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For almost two years after Ford introduced its redesigned F-150
pickup line in 1996, people wanted to know when General Motors was
going to roll out its long-awaited and much-anticipated next
generation of full-size pickups.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of consumers thought that GM was already way overdue with
a new pickup when the restyled F-150 appeared, because another
rival, Dodge, had debuted the newest generation of its full-size
Ram pickup in 1994, a radically redesigned vehicle that took the
market by storm.
</P>
<P>
   GM finally got around to updating its full-size pickups for
model year 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that GM took its time in bringing out the updated GMC
Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado so that it could get these vehicles
just right.
</P>
<P>
   No, the styling isn't radically different from the previous
generation. GM has endured some criticism for that from people who
were awed by the dramatically different styling that Ford brought
to the new F-150 and Dodge brought to the Ram.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the fenders are a bit more round and the overall look
is considerably more modern that before, but a radical restyling of
the GM pickups really wasn't necessary. GM took the time to conduct
focus-group sessions with many of its customers before redesigning
the trucks, and found that the vast majority did not want a bold
new look for the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, GM spent the money more wisely, improving just about
every other aspect of the vehicle as well as tuning up the styling.
The result is a pickup that not only is much better than it was
before, but which also outshines its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But as good as those first redesigned (1999) models were, the
2000 models are even better.
</P>
<P>
   First on the list of improvements for this year is the optional
fourth door for the extended-cab models. For this review, we tested
a three-door model, but I can tell you after a week of driving the
Sierra that I would prefer to have the fourth door.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with the three-door is that the door is on
the passenger side. That just doesn't make sense. Statistics show
that full-size pickups have only one occupant in them about 90
percent of the time. And if the driver wants to load or unload some
inside cargo, he or she must walk around to the other side of the
truck.
</P>
<P>
   GM put the third door on the driver's side in its compact-pickup
line (the Chevy S-10, GMC Sonoma and Isuzu Hombre), and justified
that by saying that it would be more convenient for the driver to
load and unload from the driver's side. But apparently that logic
didn't carry through to the designers of the full-size pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth door costs just $728, and it's worth it. If you
choose the three-door model to save money, though, you'll have to
deal with having the third door on the passenger's side. Still,
that's better than the alternative of just a few years ago _ no
rear doors at all. And if you're using the Sierra to haul people,
they can get into and out of the back on their own.
</P>
<P>
   In that back seat, there is a lot more room for people and cargo
than you'll find in the competitors' vehicles. The door is wide
enough for easy entry and exit, too. Sierra (and Silverado) have
the largest door openings on extended-cab pickups in the full-size
pickup segment.
</P>
<P>
   GM increased power by 15 horsepower in two of the full-size
pickups' engines for 2000. The 4.8-liter Vortec V-8 is now rated at
270 horsepower, while the 5.3-liter Vortec V-8 now has 285
horsepower. Torque is up by 10 foot-pounds in each engine, too.
</P>
<P>
   Our test vehicle came with the 5.3-liter engine, which offered
plenty of smooth, responsive power for all conditions, from
around-town stop-and-go driving to high-speed cruising.
</P>
<P>
   Several safety and convenience features were added for 2000,
including programmable automatic locking and unlocking of the
doors. Drivers can customize their vehicles to lock automatically
when the truck reaches 15 mph, and to automatically unlock when
they stop and remove the keys from the ignition. These features can
be turned on or off independently, and, for security reasons, the
system can be set to lock and unlock only the driver's side door
automatically, or to lock and unlock both sides simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   We drove the two-wheel-drive 1500 model, the smallest of the
full-size GM pickups and also the one with the best ride. Still, it
does ride like a truck, no matter how carlike GM tries to make it
</P>
<P>
   The interior is the Sierra's best attribute. The extended-cab
models have a back seat that is really a seat and not some short,
ill-designed attempt at one. There is support for the thighs and
plenty of leg room. About two-thirds of pickup buyers choose
extended-cab models because they need the extra passenger space,
but only the Sierra and Silverado offer a truly practical rear
seat.
</P>
<P>
   With the changes GM made in the 1999 models, the truck's frame
is stronger than before, the V-8 engines are all new and more
powerful than ever, and even the brakes are far superior to those
of the previous GM trucks and any of the competition. Four-wheel
disc brakes are now standard across the line.
</P>
<P>
   The base engine is a 4.3-liter V-6, which is standard on two-
and four-wheel-drive 1500 models. It cranks out 200 horsepower and
260 foot-pounds of torque.

&HT;     LOCK UP THE CRAZY TV 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The other night I watched the new mental
hospital drama ``Wonderland'' with one of the toughest of critics _
a former mental patient.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC show has been praised by television critics for
realistically portraying life in a big-city emergency psychiatric
ward. It has been panned by the National Alliance of the Mentally
Ill for portraying the mentally ill as violent.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Billy, a veteran of six hospitalizations for
manic-depression, panned ``Wonderland'' for assaulting the senses,
not for assaulting the oversensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is silly. It's all people flipping out,'' Billy said.
``There's too much shouting. Mental hospitals are so quiet you can
hear the Thorazine rattling in the tiny paper cups.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy admitted he may have done some shouting, but he had
another criticism: ``Real mental hospitals are more entertaining
than this. There's a reason they're called funny farms. This one
isn't funny enough.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to stop him from telling his old stories about escaping
down the laundry chute, smoking weed in the empty seclusion room
and mobilizing the manics to vote down the chronics for control of
the TV set.
</P>
<P>
   Billy also panned the show for inducing illness _ not mental
illness, but seasickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That green lighting and jiggling camera are driving me nuts,''
he said. ``The jiggling camera is meant to make things seem
realistic, but human perception doesn't work like that. God gave us
Steadicam.''
</P>
<P>
   See what he means about crazy people, even recovered ones? They
can be very funny.
</P>
<P>
   What do we get on ``Wonderland``? In just two episodes, a
schizophrenic shot five people, a pregnant woman was stabbed in the
stomach and the killer schizophrenic committed suicide with a
fountain pen. And millions of viewers got seasick.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Thursday's show, one of the actors came on and
made a little statement about how the mentally ill are
overwhelmingly nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not on this show,'' Billy said.
</P>
<P>
   The one scene that got to Billy on Thursday's episode was when
the parents of the homicidal schizophrenic got upset at doctors
discussing their son as a ``case.'' They begged the doctors to use
their son's name.
</P>
<P>
   The show does communicate some of the torment of psychosis, and
the anguish of families seeing the madness in their loved ones'
eyes, and hearing it in their bizarre tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' does not succumb to the romantic notion that
insanity is arbitrarily determined by society and that asylums are
filled with sane people, interrupted by mind-numbing psychiatric
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to describe, to someone who has never seen it, how
terrible and intractable madness often is,'' anthropologist T.M.
Luhrmann writes in ``Of Two Minds: The Growing Disorder in American
Psychiatry.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget ``Wonderland.'' Luhrmann's book is hardly intended as
entertainment, but she describes the insane and their doctors in
marvelous novelistic detail _ and she finds the humor Billy talked
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``When psychosis is not brutally awful, it is funny, and
sometimes looking for the humor in it makes it more possible to
handle the pain of seeing a human being lose his mind,'' she writes
sorrowfully.
</P>
<P>
   Luhrmann spent years doing field work in a variety of mental
institutions, studying psychiatry the way an anthropologist would
any culture. The culture of psychiatry is unnecessarily split
between two belief systems. One would treat mental illness by
passing out pills; the other would do talk therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd never get anywhere if we didn't do both,'' said Dr. Mark
Leary, deputy chief of the psychiatry department at San Francisco
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Just as most work on the range would make lousy cowboy shows,
most mental illness would make lousy hospital shows.
</P>
<P>
   As Billy put it, ``The mentally ill are just working hard being
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Then ``Wonderland'' ended and gave way to the local news and the
story of the wacked-out bicyclist shooting it out with cops on the
Bay Bridge. Maybe it will be a future episode of ``Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   It's harder to do the stories of all the former mental patients
like Billy, who are living and working among us.

&HT;     E&AMP;P NAMES RIVARD EDITOR OF YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DICK J. REAVIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Editor &AMP; Publisher, the leading journal of the
newspaper industry, has named Robert Rivard of the San Antonio
Express-News editor of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time in the magazine's 116-year history that it
has bestowed the honor, reserved for the editorial chiefs of the
nation's 1,500 daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our decision was made by our top editors, and it was made by a
unanimous vote,'' E&AMP;P Executive Editor Steve Yahn said.
</P>
<P>
   In stories about the award and its first recipient, editors at
the magazine cited three factors as pivotal in honoring Rivard:
</P>
<P>
   _ His role in dealing with the December 1998 disappearance and
slaying of the newspaper's Mexico City bureau chief, Philip True,
</P>
<P>
   _ His ``unselfish commitment to the long-term future of
newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The opinion of San Antonio civic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's April 10 issue quotes Andy Sarabia of Communities
Organized for Public Service and Steve Moore, executive director of
the San Antonio Convention and Visitors Bureau, in support of its
choice of Rivard.
</P>
<P>
   Rivard, 47, a graduate of the University of Texas at San
Antonio, began his newspaper career in 1977 as a sports reporter in
Brownsville. He covered the Central American wars for the Dallas
Times-Herald and for Newsweek, later becoming that magazine's chief
of correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Rivard returned to Texas in 1990 as deputy managing editor of
the San Antonio Light, moving to the Express-News when the city's
two dailies were consolidated three years later. He became editor
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Express-News is published in the morning and has a daily
circulation of 217,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his duties at the Express-News, Rivard is a
director of the Inter-American Press Association, and he was a
judge for the 1999 Pulitzer Prize contest, whose results will be
announced this month.
</P>
<P>
   When True was reported missing on a solo hiking trip in Mexico's
remote Sierra Madre mountains, Express-News General Manager Tom
Stephenson recalls that Rivard called him and Publisher Larry
Walker to a Sunday meeting to set a course for the newspaper's
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Larry and I thought that it was dangerous, but Bob was
adamant that he should go to Mexico,'' Stephenson said. ``He wasn't
going to be able to live with himself if he didn't do everything
that he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivard led the expedition that, a few days later, discovered and
unearthed True's body from a shallow grave in a canyon where he had
been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have never recovered Philip's body or known what
happened had Bob not gone,'' Walker said. ``He exemplified what
newspeople from around the world would like an editor to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Two men were arrested last year in the killing, but Rivard noted
that neither has been brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``In May,'' he said, ``we'll be going to Mexico again, to meet
with the governor and attorney general of Jalisco state and with a
new judge in the case, and to demand some answers.''
</P>
<P>
   In E&AMP;P's edition naming Rivard as editor of the year, the
magazine publishes an article about True's disappearance and
slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful that the case is being spotlighted,'' Rivard
said.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also cites Rivard for his decision in October to
decline an offer to become editor of the Miami Herald. He turned
down the job when the Hearst Corp., owner of the Express-News,
agreed to increase the newsroom budget.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in E&AMP;P notes that Rivard ``demonstrated an
unselfish commitment to the long-term future of newspapers when he
turned a golden career opportunity _ editorship of the Miami Herald
_ into an investment in new journalists, better staff pay and a
bigger news hole.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rivard explained, ``I thought that I had taken the
Express-News as far I could take it, given the resources that were
available. We had too few people who were not paid well enough, and
there was a news space problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, he recalled, ``Hearst bought a newspaper that
didn't have computers and didn't have presses. It has been
investing millions since 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations to keep him in San Antonio, he said Hearst
``decided to invest in its people as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Also important, Rivard said, were actions by Hearst on behalf of
True's widow and infant son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha True is now in Brownsville, little Philip is a happy,
healthy baby and Hearst has secured the family's future,'' he said.
``The corporation's concern for Philip's family was central to my
decision to stay here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Express-News is not yet a great newspaper, but it has
great days and I think that we're on our way.''

IS THE GAME STRIKING OUT OR BATTING .300?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball is dying. Nobody cares about it.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is thriving. The game has never been more exciting.
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're thinking. I'm arguing with myself. My tenuous
connection with reality has finally evaporated. Next thing you
know, I'll be insisting that Elian Gonzalez should stay in Miami
and go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Those contradictory judgments about the condition of baseball
come from a couple of pundits who usually aim their intellectual
firepower in the direction of weightier matters _ public policy,
politics, societal trends of global significance.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Krauthammer, who writes for Time magazine, and
George Will of Newsweek decided to ponder baseball in the April 3
issues of their respective magazines. Leave it to the deep-thinkers
to examine the same crime scene and reach diametrically different
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Krauthammer says that major-league baseball has never recovered
from its ``catastrophic'' 1994 strike and that the game is in
``deep decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Will says that the impressive accomplishments of future Hall of
Famers such as Cal Ripken, Derek Jeter and Ivan Rodriguez make
baseball ``in many ways better than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Krauthammer says that America has tuned out the sport _ that
fans chatter eagerly and endlessly about basketball and football,
but where baseball is concerned, ``There is no talk. No interest.
No buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   Will says that baseball is embarking on a ``crackerjack (so to
speak) season'' and that even though the first game was played in
Japan this year, opening day remains a ``civic festival.''
</P>
<P>
   If these guys are that far apart on baseball, I can't wait to
see their competing columns on the relative qualifications of Al
Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But we're talking baseball, as well we should be at the outset
of a new season; it's the one point in time when every fan can
believe that his or her favorite team might have an autumn date
with destiny.
</P>
<P>
   As a lifelong aficionado of the game, I must confess that I hope
against hope that Will is correct. Nothing would please me more
than to see the onetime national pastime recapture its former
glory, to see the game that once caused school kids to play hooky
re-establish itself as the preeminent sport in a sport-crazed
nation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand _ as a disillusioned baseball fan who has
spent much of the last decade boycotting the game in disgust, I
find it hard to disagree with Krauthammer's pessimistic assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the boycott. I'm forever running into someone who wants to
know if I'm still boycotting baseball _ an encouraging sign,
perhaps, in view of Krauthammer's contention that nobody even talks
about baseball these days.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is ``yes.'' And ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   There I go again.
</P>
<P>
   To the annoyance of some hard-core boycotters, I modified my
boycott two years ago to place more emphasis on keeping players and
team owners from getting their hands on my hard-earned money, and
less on the futile goal of shutting myself off from any exposure to
the game.
</P>
<P>
   I refuse to attend games in person or purchase licensed
merchandise such as T-shirts and coffee mugs. But I can watch games
on television, and I can read baseball stories in the newspaper. I
can watch baseball highlights on the TV news.
</P>
<P>
   It is undeniably a wimpy boycott. But it's my boycott, and I
figure I can go about it any way I see fit.
</P>
<P>
   Next question: Why bother?
</P>
<P>
   Did you see the item in the Sports section the other day that
said the average salary of major-league ballplayers this season is
$1,988,034? The story said that 377 of the game's 840 players _
nearly 45 percent _ make $1 million or more; 20 players will
collect $9 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Two problems: The fans are footing the bill. And most of the
ungrateful bums who haul down those preposterous paychecks aren't
worth a fraction of what they are being paid.
</P>
<P>
   So _ is baseball dying or thriving?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it depends on whether you ask the payers or the payees.

WHEN YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF FUNDS, THINK DIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. I participate in my company's profit-sharing. In addition
to the fund I am using, I have choices of four other Diversified
Investors Strategic Allocation funds: Short-Term Horizon, Short
International Horizon, Intermediate Horizon, and Long Horizon. What
do you suggest I do?
</P>
<P>
   J.G., La Mesa, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. These are what are called funds of funds _ or funds that
limit their investments to shares of other mutual funds within the
same family. The idea is to provide a diversified portfolio that is
appropriate to your situation. In the case of the Diversified
Strategic Allocation funds, the company chooses among 14 separate
funds, allocating the portfolio according to the investor's
investment timeframe.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, a long-term portfolio will be accumulating for more
than 10 years, an intermediate one for five to 10 years, and a
short-term investment for less than five years. With nine years to
go until a typical retirement date, you're in about the right
place.
</P>
<P>
   But you can also use these categories to reflect your appetite
for risk. If you consider yourself a conservative investor, you
could well decide to switch to the more cautious Diversified
Investors Intermediate Horizon Strategic Allocation fund.
</P>
<P>
   To give you an idea of the way the portfolios of these funds
change, I'll list the top five holdings of each: The
intermediate/long-term fund has 13.9 percent of its assets in
Diversified Special fund, which focuses on small-cap growth stocks;
11.4 percent in Diversified Growth fund, a large-cap growth fund;
11.1 percent in Diversified Investors Equity Income, with a
large-cap value-oriented portfolio; 10.9 percent in a core bond
fund; and 10.2 percent in an international stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   With Intermediate Horizon Strategic Allocation, you would have
23.2 percent in the bond fund, 10.1 percent in the Special fund,
9.4 percent in a high-yield bond fund, 8.9 percent in a
high-quality bond fund, and 8.5 percent in the equity-income find.
In short, by moving from a concentration of stocks to a heavier
bond portfolio, the intermediate-term fund is safer, but is also
less likely to deliver stock market gains.
</P>
<P>
   Given the state of the market, if I were you I would switch to
Diversified Investors Intermediate Horizon Strategic Allocation
fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have had Fidelity Puritan for years, but recently it has
not done well. I am elderly and hesitate to sell if this fund has a
good chance of recovering. Do you think this is a temporary slump?
</P>
<P>
   M.A., Fort Worth, Texas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Puritan certainly has been taking its lumps, but I wouldn't
lose faith. This is a well-disciplined fund, maintaining a solid
value-oriented stock portfolio, and a solid (if far from gilt-edge)
portfolio of bonds. Both sectors it favors _ bonds of all stripes
and value-oriented stocks _ have been the wrong places to be in the
last year or so, although in the near term the value stocks have
been picking up.
</P>
<P>
   I think you can blame the lion's share of the fund's 2.9 percent
loss in 1999 on the bond position. But remember 1994, the last
horrible year for bonds before 1999. That year, Puritan's total
return worked out to a scant 1.8 percent. The next year, however,
the same bond portfolio that had plagued it in 1994 propelled it to
a 21.5 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying 2000 will be anything like 1995 for Puritan. But
I do think it's a solid fund and it has been sticking to its
knitting, no matter how unpopular its chosen market segments are at
any particular time.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the current choppy markets it should prove
relatively steady. Its stock portfolio is focused on financials,
industrials, and services, and its price-to-earnings ratio is a
comforting 24.7. It has a distinct underweighting in technology
issues _ one reason it bucked the bond market of 1999, but also the
reason it is not suffering horribly this month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Morningstar Mutual Funds had reduced its rating to
three stars, or average, that's based entirely on statistical data.
It seems as clear that its analysts want to give its shareholders
some solace: a classic conservatively managed balanced fund,
Morningstar summarizes.
</P>
<P>
   I agree, and suggest you hang on for better seasons. Despite the
poor recent performance, look to its five-year record of 14.57
percent average annual gains, or the 10-year record of 13.41
percent. In time, shareholders who stay with the fund should be
rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 90-year-old mother received some AT&AMP;T spinoff stocks as an
inheritance 13 years ago. Some have been sold since then to
supplement her $500 monthly Social Security income. She lives alone
in a senior apartment complex and is very private, so I only know
that the value of her stocks was about $100,000 in January 1999.
Her quarterly dividends and her Social Security income have not
been enough to meet her obligations. Her rent is $400 a month, plus
utilities. Though a novice, I'm of the opinion that the stocks are
too risky. In truth, she's too elderly to chance it at all. I'd
much prefer that she cash them in, set aside the capital gains tax
money in some short-term savings account, and put the balance in
some kind of government or state bond. If I'm correct, the
principal would be safe, and the yield would be more than she is
currently receiving. At the moment I've got her attention and feel
she will act on my suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   B.K., Bedford, N.H. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You're certainly right that your mother isn't getting much in
the way of yield. As this is written, the best she is getting is
2.9 percent from US West; at the other end of the spectrum, the
yield on Vodafone Airtouch is a token 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I agree it would be better under the circumstances to sell these
securities and replace them with a fixed-income holding, but I'm
not sure I'd go for either state or government bonds. In the first
case, state bonds are attractive to most people for their
tax-exempt feature. From your description of your mother's
finances, it seems that taxes are not likely to pose a major
problem. Government bonds, or a government bond fund, would be
better, with a reasonable expectation of yields in the 6 percent
range. But just as stocks are susceptible to the markets, bond
funds can lose money. Last year, as interest rates rose steadily,
many bond funds ended up in the red.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, at this point CD rates look relatively
attractive. Last week, the nation's best rate for a five-year CD of
less than $100,000 was 7.46 percent. So why fool around with
government bonds and accept the risk when you can get a better
yield with full insurance at the bank?
</P>
<P>
   The only wrinkle is that you need to shop around fairly
aggressively. That 7.46 percent high compared to a 6 percent
national average. You can find the highest rates in newspapers and
online, such as at www.bankrate.com. It provides all the
information you need, including toll-free telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   If you take this course, calculate beforehand what your mother's
tax obligations are likely to be. My guess is you'll find that a
great percentage of the proceeds of any sale is going to be a
taxable capital gain. You might discover you would be better off
spreading the sales over two or more years.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you take the CD route, I suggest you put the bulk of
the money into a five-year CD,but leave a fairly modest amount _
perhaps a tenth _ in a six-month CD, where you can find rates of up
to 6.70 percent and retain a higher degree of liquidity. Then, if
your mother runs into unexpected expenses, she won't face an
early-withdrawal penalty as with the 5-year instrument.

PLANS FOR A NORTH-SOUTH SUMMIT MEETING SURPRISE MANY SOUTH
KOREANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ The news that this country had sealed its
biggest diplomatic breakthrough in its half-century of conflict
with North Korea, its estranged and impoverished twin, seemed to
have reached everyone in this capital by late Monday morning and
left no one indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   From experts in their think tanks to commuters rushing to work,
South Koreans seemed stunned by the secret diplomacy whose fruit,
announced in an unprecedented simultaneous statement issued in the
capitals of both countries Monday morning, will be a June visit to
the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, by President Kim Dae-jung of
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly speaking, no one saw North Korea saying yes to a
summit meeting at this time,'' said Cho Dong-ho, the head of North
Korean economic studies at the Korea Development Institute, a
private, non-profit research group here. ``We have all been deeply
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was positive in almost every instance, but came
freighted with complex sentiments and anxieties that are the legacy
of a shared history of wartime violence, yield-no-quarter
ideological jousting and harshly contrasting economic fates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really think these countries will unify anytime soon?''
asked Han Kyoung-ok, a 51-year-old woman who was preparing to board
a train at midday. ``For people of my generation, this is good
news. But younger people have grown soft in this country, and now I
fear that the Northerners, who have lived through so much, will
out-compete us.''
</P>
<P>
   Her statement reflected in part the fact that the span of her
life, roughly the period since June 1950, when the war that divided
the countries broke out, has coincided with an extraordinary
turnabout in the fortunes of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of their separate histories, North Korea,
although more sparsely populated, was by far the more prosperous of
the two. But since the 1970s, and accelerating more each year,
South Korea has outstripped its neighbor, becoming one of the
world's most energetic and entrepreneurial societies while the
Stalinist north, though still heavily armed, has wallowed in
devastating famines and industrial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   These contrasting fortunes are advertised by billboards that by
night flash slogans like ``South Korea: the land of opportunity''
on the mountainsides just south of the heavily armed border. These
days, though, the message seems unnecessary, as North Koreans risk
their lives to flee hunger, crossing into China in hopes of
eventually making their way to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Like Han, several other South Koreans interviewed expressed
trepidation about the diplomatic opening with the North, and the
unpredictability of renewing high-level contact between countries
that share the same language, history and culture but that have
been so divided by politics and economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't support unification, because things are nice the way
they are now,'' said Hwang Ji-hwa, 21, who spoke while in downtown
Seoul. ``There are just too many differences between our countries.
If we try to unify, things might get out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While others applauded Kim's so-called Sunshine Policy, the
program of steady diplomatic and financial engagement with North
Korea that produced the breakthrough, some South Koreans warned
that what lies ahead is plenty of heavy slogging and ultimately a
high price tag for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Many South Korean experts on North Korean diplomatic behavior
wondered aloud Monday what price had been extracted by the
Pyongyang government for the breakthrough, especially given the
announcement's timing, on the eve of critical legislative elections
here Thursday. In practical terms, the vote will determine how much
power the South Korean president, Kim, wields for his remaining
three years in office.
</P>
<P>
   And in addition to finally rewarding Kim for the steep political
risks he has taken in reaching out to the North, several analysts
here said that Pyongyang had likely calculated that the eve of the
vote was the moment to strike a diplomatic deal at the highest
price. After its dramatic news conference Monday morning, the
government released no new details about the agreement with North
Korea, leaving people to guess about its terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all waiting for the details of what we must give them
and what we can expect from North Korea,'' said Yeon Ha-cheong, the
dean of the school of marketing at Myongai University in Seoul, and
an expert in relations with Pyongyang. ``North Korea will certainly
demand lots of things.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's recent pattern of diplomatic behavior seems to
support this view. For years, following the end of the Cold War and
the loss of most of its Communist allies, the country bore the
title of the world's most isolated regime. Now North Korea has
recently emerged as one of the most diplomatically active
countries, as it has rushed to establish ties with a wide range of
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Often, though, formal ties _ or even serious diplomatic contacts
_ have come at a steep price. There have been persistent reports in
recent weeks that since agreeing to resume official talks with
Japan, Pyongyang has sought $5 billion in ``reparations'' from
Tokyo for its colonial rule in Korea.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States, too, has often been put in a position where
it had to commit to helping ease North Korea's economic
catastrophe, through major food or fuel deliveries, in exchange for
Pyongyang's cooperation in suspending its nuclear weapons
development or halting the testing of its long range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, after weeks of campaigning against Kim's Sunshine Policy
as a fruitless sellout of South Korea, the president's political
rivals were threatened by the dramatic diplomatic turnabout and
clung to the line that a summit meeting with hidden, and presumably
high costs is no victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government must have paid a huge price, or agreed to some
secret conditions to reach this deal, but that side has not been
revealed,'' said Jan Kwang-keun, a spokesman for the Grand National
Party, the main opposition group. ``We want to remind people that
such compensations involve taxpayers' money.'' &QL;

APPRAISAL DIDN'T RING TRUE, BUT THE SETTLEMENT WAS A GEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many people thought Michael and Nancy Greco were crazy, but you
have to admire their tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who don't remember, the Grecos took a cruise
last year and, at a stop in Cozumel, paid $2,400 for a tanzanite
and diamond ring that their Mexican jeweler appraised at $6,530.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great price _ one many consumers would put in the
category of too good to be true. But the Grecos had been reassured
by representatives of Celebrity Cruises, a division of Royal
Caribbean Cruises Ltd., that everything was on the up and up.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise line representatives, a company called Onboard Media,
offered a guarantee of quality and value as long as passengers
shopped at approved stores. The guarantee was contingent on an
appraisal by an independent gemologist within 30 days of a
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   As I reported in December, Michael Greco did what most consumers
never do. After returning to his home in Southeastern
Massachusetts, he tracked down an independent gemologist who
appraised the ring at $1,900. Stunned, Greco alleged fraud and
started raising a ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   The Cozumel jeweler, Rachat &AMP; Romero, insisted that its
certified appraised price was more like a suggested retail price.
The jeweler offered to refund Greco's money if he returned the ring
or pay him $500, the difference between his $1,900 appraisal and
the $2,400 he had paid for the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Onboard Media called the Rachat &AMP; Romero offer ``extremely
diplomatic'' and said it wasn't required by the guarantee. Company
officials said the guarantee meant only that participating
retailers would repair or replace any unsatisfactory item. They
also suggested a second appraisal was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Greco refused the jeweler's settlement offer. He said he had
caught Rachat &AMP; Romero engaging in fraud and that giving him his
money back wasn't enough. The $2,400 he paid for his ring was 37
percent of the jeweler's appraised price, so he said he would be
satisfied to pay only 37 percent of the $1,900 appraised value. In
other words, he would go away if he got to keep the ring and Rachat
&AMP; Romero refunded $1,697, plus the $100 cost of Greco's appraisal.
Rachat &AMP; Romero balked.
</P>
<P>
   After the column appeared, readers reacted. A few praised Greco,
but most thought he was trying to pull a fast one. In general, his
critics thought he was naive to have relied on the jeweler's
appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old saw that you get what you pay for is certainly
appropriate in the jewelry industry,'' said Marc Jasmin of Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Greco's critics thought he should take the jeweler's
offer. But Greco wasn't about to give in. In a Jan. 10 letter to
Rachat &AMP; Romero, he raised the stakes: He demanded a ring
acceptable to him with a true value of $6,500, or $4,100 in cash _
the difference between the jeweler's appraised price of $6,500 and
the $2,400 purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accept my offer or come here to sue me for what you believe is
right,'' Greco wrote. ``If you come here, be aware that
Massachusetts law allows for triple damages plus reasonable
attorneys fees if we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Pubols of Rachat &AMP; Romero reponded with a letter saying
the jeweler's earlier refund offer was ``more than generous. . . At
this point we will have to consider the matter closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two sides talked again on Jan. 27, and Pubols agreed to
Greco's original demand _ that he be charged only 37 percent of the
$1,900 appraisal. But Greco now wanted more. He made a counteroffer
that he be allowed to keep the ring plus receive a refund of the
full $2,400 purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 21, Hugh Treadwell, vice president of Onboard Media,
wrote to Greco, saying that the company would honor his
counteroffer and refund the full purchase price, without any
conditions. His only caveat was that he wanted to run two
additional appraisals on the ring to see if Greco's $1,900
appraisal was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If two or three independent appraisals confirm yours, it is in
our company's and this industry's best interest to properly verify
that fact in order to take any action,'' Treadwell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Told of Greco's settlement, Jasmin of Waltham, Mass. said,
``There is truth to the adage that the squeaky wheel gets the
grease. . . One would only hope that Greco would be a bit smarter
next time. If he tries for another refund, he may find his next
encounter less fruitful.''
</P>
<P>
   Greco said he knows some people will think he made out like a
bandit. But he doesn't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still didn't get what we were originally told we would
get,'' he said, noting he was promised a $6,500 ring for $2,400.
``This whole thing also took all the romance and the excitement out
of purchasing the ring.''

   At the end of her column, she says that if you're uncomfortable

card solicitations for gold and platinum cards. But recently he got
one for an Aspire Diamond Visa card. ``With a name like diamond,
you'd expect to be treated like a preferred customer with low
interest rates,'' he said. But when he looked at the fine print, he
discovered just the opposite. Diamond status qualifies you for an
interest rate of 27 percent, and 33 percent in the event of
delinquency. Ouch!

&HT;     FEASTING ON THE FENZY OF CYBERSPACE STOCK TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last week, the Nasdaq plunged and I decided to
take the dive, too. I became an on-line stock trader.
</P>
<P>
   And if I can be a little smug, I didn't do so badly for somebody
who didn't have a clue what she was doing.
</P>
<P>
   My timing, for once, was perfect. After a three-day scavenger
hunt looking for tech stocks at bottomed-out prices, I made a 13.45
percent profit by the close of the market Friday, even after the
$29.95 commission I paid for each of my 20 transactions.
</P>
<P>
   And I would have made even more if I hadn't run out of money
before discovering a few other nuggets just screaming to be bought.
Alas, others heard the cries, snatching them from my outstretched
greedy fingers literally pennies from my low-ball bids. As luck
would have it, five of my wannabe tech stocks _ Infospace,
Vignette, Brocade, Exodus, Redback _ far surpassed the achievements
of my modest but stalwart keepsakes, popping up from $50 to $100
before my sorrowful eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Which all leads me to three lessons I learned from my
self-taught crash course:
</P>
<P>
   _ You have to have money to make money.
</P>
<P>
   _ The three screaming meemies _ Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda _ will
drive you crazy.
</P>
<P>
   _ You have to get some sleep.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why they call the crazies I joined ``day traders.''
I haven't pulled so many all-nighters since college. Who can sleep?
If you're a newbie like me without some stockbroker or guru to help
you, you have to spend some time researching and deciding which
stocks to pick and what prices to pay.
</P>
<P>
   So many choices, so little money.
</P>
<P>
   I was surprised at how ill-prepared I was to jump in. I had been
watching the stock market for months, hoarding newspaper and
magazine articles talking about trends and hot stocks, seething at
all these 1,000 percent run-ups on stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   I was obsessed with what happened to eBay, the on-line auction
site that I, as a compulsive shopaholic collector of all things
ridiculous, knew only too well. That could have been me tripling my
family's nest egg, I'd whine bitterly as eBay stock soared from
$80-something, when I first started paying attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, if we only had some money, I'd complain to my husband,
Marty. Trouble was, creditors and expenses already had dibs on our
salaries. The family nest egg was the Mickey Mouse bank on our
bureau that we used for spare change. It's gotten so hard to just
keep the checkbook balanced that our 12-year-old son Mark got his
own savings account and won't tell us his password because we kept
hitting him up.
</P>
<P>
   I've obsessed about buying a house. We moved to San Francisco
three years ago from Philadelphia, where folks have a hard time
giving away mansions for $125K. We were galled by the housing
prices here, especially for tiny termite-infested bungalows. If
only we had bought then. Those $300K houses in Berkeley and Oakland
that we might have been able to afford with low mortgage interest
are $400K to $600K now.
</P>
<P>
   My parents, Greek immigrants who still walk a mile to the
supermarket that honors double coupons, could stand my self-pity no
more. I had nagged my dad for a year to get rid of his respectable
but snail-paced Citigroup stock that he had owned for eons and to
pop aboard the Nasdaq roller coaster. Instead, he did what I should
feel utterly ashamed to admit: He sent us some money, nearly the
only savings my folks had left after decades working as a waiter
and as a seamstress, so we could put a down payment on a house.
</P>
<P>
   Being a modern-day daughter, I snatched it. I even made him
FedEx it to me.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, what was a fortune to my parents and to us and to anyone
living anywhere else in the country was barely enough for a 3
percent down payment for a house.
</P>
<P>
   So my husband and I decided that if we're going to compete with
housing prices driven up by dot-com funny money, we better go after
it, too.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it on Tuesday, April 4, the stock market was
already spiraling down, down, down last week when I saw that my
dad's certified check had cleared my bank. My husband, having
learned early on that I was a control freak dictator, just let me
handle it.
</P>
<P>
   He went to work.
</P>
<P>
   I turned on the computer at home.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 8:30 a.m. Pacific time, early for me, but 11:30
a.m. in New York. I was psyched. I was going to make a killing.
</P>
<P>
   I had decided long ago that I would do all the trading on line,
to take advantage of those cheap commissions. I had chosen ETrade
as the gateway to our fortune. I loved those goofball colors of
lime green and violet blue in ETrade's logo, its sassy billboard
signs, and the fact that some honcho in the company looked like he
had a Greek surname.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I'm there. I'm at the computer. I go to the ETrade home
page. I click on the link to start a new account. And, ugh, first
thing I learn is that I am limited to a $2,000 initial deposit.
That wasn't the minimum. It was the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Ugh No. 2: After filling out the application and getting my
``Congratulations'' note, I was told that some snafu transferring
money from my bank prevented me from trading that day. I'd be
getting an application in the mail that I could send back in the
mail with my signature and check.
</P>
<P>
   The MAIL, I screamed at their customer service reps. You're
kidding, right? The stock market is going blooey, you're an on-line
brokerage, and you're telling me I have to wait for the mail?
</P>
<P>
   Greek expletive. Greek expletive. Greek expletive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, stock prices are plummeting. My dad is calling me
frantically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marianna, Marianna, Cisco is at 64!'' he said, breathless.
</P>
<P>
   I had CNN on in the background. I knew. I knew.
</P>
<P>
   It was noon. The stock market was closing in an hour and I was
feeling desperate. After a few more attempts with ETrade ``customer
service'' _ ``Please let me wire you the money, let me drive it
down to your Menlo Park office'' _ I called Charles Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   I had nixed the idea of doing business with Schwab long ago.
First, they charged more in commission for Nasdaq stocks, $29.95
vs. $19.95. And the offices there seemed too polished. It was a
wingtip place, and I'm strictly Birkenstock.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no time to be choosy. I called Schwab. A rep took
my application over the phone. Five minutes later, I was walking
over to its headquarters on Montgomery Street. I signed the
application and handed over a personal check. And that was that. I
was ready to make some money.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the market had closed.
</P>
<P>
   Having missed out on the Cisco bargain, I decided to do some
research and go after the more aggressive, riskier stocks in tech
and telecommunications, the industries that had gone gangbusters
last year. My husband and I really wanted to make a lot of money
and we wanted to make it fast. Our hope was to double our cash so
we could buy a house within a year.
</P>
<P>
   We also decided that, given that we were clueless, we'd rather
have a lot of different stocks in small quantities, say 10 to 100
shares of each, rather than let all our fantasies ride on one or
two stocks. Besides, I later realized, I felt like I was a part of
the new economy by owning a cornucopia of these Internet and tech
stocks. It wasn't Them anymore. It was Us.
</P>
<P>
   OK. What to buy? Ebay was too expensive. I pulled out my news
clips to get some names of stocks to research. I also had a list of
hot stocks from my husband's friend, George, who is an avid market
watcher.
</P>
<P>
   I narrowed my choices by cross-referencing. Which stocks kept
getting mentioned in those stories about stockbrokers' favorites?
Which stocks were considered leaders in their niche?
</P>
<P>
   After narrowing my choices to about 50 companies, I checked out
Schwab's amazing charts and analysts' reports. I then made my own
list, noting several key points for each stock: the 52-week high
and low, its median price range in recent months, and the daily
price range over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to control the price I paid, rather than exposing
myself to whatever price happened to be floating on the stock
market floor when my order to buy went through. I was placing
limit'' bids, meaning that was my top price.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding on that magic price was the hard part. Depending on how
much I lusted after the stock, I tried to get it for several
notches below the median price I had noted on my list and within
the price range of recent days' trading.
</P>
<P>
   I then crossed my fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, I was too stingy, and saw the stock race away from
me. But most of the time, my strategy worked. By the end of the
week, I'd made a nifty profit.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   You're doing your taxes at the last minute, and you're stumped
by a tax question or missing a key tax form. Where do you go for
immediate assistance?
</P>
<P>
   Now you can turn to the Internet at all hours of the day and
night to get the latest tax advice or print out virtually every tax
form and publication imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   The information can be found at Web sites for the Internal
Revenue Service, state revenue agencies, Quicken, and Microsoft's
MoneyCentral, as well as sites of traditional tax preparation and
accounting firms such as Jackson Hewitt, H&AMP;R Block, and Deloitte &AMP;
Touche.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also some other, lesser known sites that offer a
comprehensive menu of tax information and news, such as
www.TaxPlanet.com by nationally syndicated columnist Gary Klott,
and www.Fairmark.com by Kaye Thomas, a tax attorney whose book
``Consider Your Options: Get the Most from Your Equity
Compensation'' was just published.
</P>
<P>
   And there are sites that allow you to pose a tax question online
and get an answer instantly.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newest sites, by a Newton, mass. company called
iAskWeb, uses so-called natural language computer technology to
allow an Internet user to type in a tax question in any number of
ways and get the right answer.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who types in ``Are there limits on deduction of
charitable contribution?'' gets the same answer as someone who
types in ``What are the limits on deduction of charitable
contribution?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 1,500 answers now, with four to 10 questions
pointing to each,'' said Maxim Grudin, president of iAskWeb, who
holds a doctorate in artificial intelligence. ``Altogether, the
system can answer several thousand questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from tax information and the ability to print forms and
publications, some Web sites also offer calculators to estimate
taxes, a tax IQ test, and a chart of average deductions taken by US
taxpayers in different income groups with which you can compare
your own situation.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a round-up of some of the tax sites:
</P>
<P>
   --www.irs.gov: This is the official IRS source for tax filing
instructions, forms, and publications. But it also tries to be
taxpayer-friendly, with an online game show called ``Braintaxers''
and a ``Digital Daily'' newsletter that's ``faster than a speeding
1040-EZ.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is organized into several sections, with the most
useful information for last-minute filers found in links entitled
``Tax Info for You,'' ``Tax Regs in English,'' and ``Forms &AMP;
Pubs.'' The links are usually found at the bottom of each Web page.
</P>
<P>
   At ``Tax Info for You,'' you can find answers to questions about
deductions, credits, and taxable income; tax tables; a W-4 tax
withholding calculator; and tax-saving tips. At ``Tax Regs in
English,'' are plain-language summaries of tax regulations and the
latest official rulings. And at ``Forms &AMP; Pubs,'' you can download
not only the documents for the 1999 tax year, but also those dating
back to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin optional trim) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --www.state.ma.us/dor: You can download Massachusetts tax forms
and publications and learn about your filing options and the latest
state tax rulings and regulations at this official site for the
state Department of Revenue.
</P>
<P>
   For the really last-minute filers, you'll be happy to find that
here you are not alone. The DOR typically receives 1 million
returns _ nearly one-third of all returns filed _ during the last
week of tax season.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll also be happy to learn that you have until Tuesday,
April 18, to file both the Massachusetts and federal return. That's
because the traditional filing deadline of April 15 falls on a
Saturday, and the next business day, Monday, April 17, is the
Patriot's Day holiday in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end optional trim) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --www.TaxPlanet.com: Subtitled ``All things tax for
individuals,'' this Internet site by syndicated columnist Gary
Klott offers a wealth of information ranging from the latest tax
news to a year-round tax guide, to tax tips and downloadable IRS
forms.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, top headlines last week updated Internet users on
legislation to provide relief from the so-called marriage tax and
to protect taxpayers' rights. The site is the only one reviewed
that lets users know that most Northeast taxpayers have until April
18 to file, since the regional IRS center is in Massachusetts and
is closed on Patriot's Day, Monday, April 17.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly comprehensive is the tax library, providing links
to such information as IRS news, General Accounting Office reports
on the IRS, Congressional tax bills, and White House tax plans.
</P>
<P>
   The site is heavy on graphics, however, and may be slow for some
computers to upload.
</P>
<P>
   --www.Fairmark.com: Subtitled ``Tax Guide for Investors,'' this
comprehensive Web site by Fairmark Press offers more than 700 pages
of guidance, for everyone from beginning investors to traders.
Fairmark Press published tax attorney Thomas' book ``Consider Your
Options.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Tax Guide for Traders,'' you can find out whether your
short-term trading may qualify you as a ``trader'' by occupation
for more favorable tax treatment. But it also warns about the law's
unclear definition and other potential pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Among other special issues covered in-depth here: Roth IRAs,
capital gains, mutual funds, custodial accounts for minors, and
compensation in stock and options. You can also post a question on
the site's message board and link to tax forms.
</P>
<P>
   --www.MoneyCentral.msn.com/tax/home.asp: This Microsoft tax site
provides the typical summary of tax law changes, advice on reducing
taxes, and links to tax forms. It also tries to sell you on
Microsoft's TaxSaver with a free download.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the neatest features: A calculator you can use to
estimate your taxes, an interactive tax IQ test, and an interactive
deduction finder for such categories as employee business expenses
and investor expenses.
</P>
<P>
   --www.Quicken.com/taxes: Aside from pitching TurboTax, Quicken's
tax program, and offering the usual tax information, this site
allows you to compare your deductions to other US taxpayers in the
same income group. You can minimize your chances of being audited
by making sure your deductions aren't out of line with US averages,
although there's no guarantee, according to the site.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an exhaustive message board on such topics as IRAs,
capital gains, surviving an audit, and education tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   --www.iAskWeb.com: Company president Grudin says his site uses
technology that better simulates natural language than the
better-known ``Ask Jeeves'' site, and that it provides more tax
answers than can be found at www.Jeeves.com. He adds that being
able to type in a tax question directly is more efficient than
having to surf a Web site looking for the link to the right answer.
</P>
<P>
   The answers to general tax questions aren't yet fully developed,
but the answers to questions about IRAs are, says Grudin. Internet
users can go directly to the ``IRA Expert'' at
www.iAskWeb.com/ira.html to type in their questions. And they can
test out the still-in-development general tax system by typing
their questions in at www.iAskWeb.com/html/tax1.html.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held iAskWeb is in the final stages of
negotiations with H.D. Vest, a financial services firm, to make the
technology available through www.hdvest.com, according to Grudin.
Nothing has been signed yet. He also said iAskWeb ``has entered
into negotiations with several large well-known tax sites,'' which
he declined to publicly disclose.
</P>
<P>
   The computer algorithm was developed by Boris Galitsky, who has
a doctorate in natural language and is iAskWeb's chief technical
officer. The company, incorporated last fall, is just about to
close on its first round of financing, according to Grudin.

JUST POCKET FUZZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   So, you're at a party in what now seems like another life, and
this guy looks over his hors d'oeuvre cracker and says ``Akamai.''
Or maybe he says ``eBay'' or ``CMGI'' or ``Sycamore,'' and he says
it the way the businessman in ``The Graduate'' said ``plastics'' to
Dustin Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   But you're not some kid fresh out of school. You've got mutual
funds, a career, and nice suits. Mostly you've got rock-solid
common sense, which seems to justify the superior laughter in your
swift retort: ``Akamai? Never heard of it. Get real.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the stock that was selling for pocket fuzz as an
unknown doubles, triples, and heads for Pluto, you remember the
night, and the party, and the guy, and the hors d'oeuvre cracker.
You even remember the olive and the cheese on the cracker. You
close your eyes and hear the wail of a saxophone doing a mean riff
with a train whistle somewhere in the back alley of your mind, and
you're singing the blues for the one that got away.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Sarkis, president of Back Bay Restaurant Group,
remembers the night he was too busy to listen to AOL founder Steve
Case, and associates, attending an opening of a Papa Razzi
restaurant in Washington in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Yeah, yeah, yeah,' '' Sarkis recalls. ``I had 200
people to serve.'' A friend of his did listen and bought AOL at $11
a share. ``He's not working now,'' Sarkis says with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   It hurts so bad, even though times are good _ because times are
good, really. When fortunes seem as easy to grab as a cup of
coffee, any fortune not grabbed assumes the proportions of a fiscal
fish story. The loss pains even those business stars who would seem
to be beyond caring, since they run the success stories that were
once the hot tips over hors d'oeuvre crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Allen, cofounder of Microsoft and now head of Vulcan
Northwest Inc., did not want to talk about the time he sold his
stake in AOL cheap. David Wetherell, chief executive of CMGI, who
passed on eBay, sent a terse e-mail saying he was ``not interested
in revisiting it.''
</P>
<P>
   That bad, huh?
</P>
<P>
   ``The regret is more dramatic today,'' says Joe Weintraub,
management professor at Babson College and an organizational
psychologist. ``It's like looking in a window, pressing your nose
against the glass. The stress is greater because of all the
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, those missed opportunities to buy _ or to sell just before
the market tanks, as it did last week. The only way to deal with
the road not taken to the bank is philosophically. Think Robert
Frost. Think Alfred E. Newman. Think Mike Kornblum.
</P>
<P>
   Kornblum is a Boston public relations executive who got in on
the ground floor of eBay for $17 a share because his sister worked
there, allowing him to take advantage of a special offer to family
and friends. ``I was scared to death,'' says Kornblum, who invested
$3,500 and saw the stock price double by the end of the day. That's
when he bailed out, netting about a $3,000 profit, after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider the $3,000 a gift from heaven that I didn't work
for,'' Kornblum says. ``If you take any other attitude you'll go
crazy.'' He adds that his sister is headed for early retirement at
age 34 and is helping to pay for his kitchen remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   Humor helps at times like these, and a visit to the Bessemer
Venture Partners' Web site is a balm to the wounded psyche.
Bessemer is probably the only company in Massachusetts _ maybe in
the world _ laughing at the ones that got away. The Wellesley
venture capital firm features an ``Anti-portfolio,'' subtitled
``Don't Click Here,'' listing smart investments never made in
winners including eBay, Apple Computer, Intel, Intuit, Lotus, and
Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   The company notes that its ``long and storied history has
afforded our firm an unparalleled number of opportunities to
completely screw up.'' You gotta love these guys.
</P>
<P>
   Partner Chris Gabrieli says the file was inspired by the
intensity of the culture of regret out there in Boom Nation and by
the sound of so many heads banging against so many walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an unprecedented sense of scale and success today,''
he says. ``Venture guys and entrepreneurs are totally obsessed with
this. They're focused on what they've missed _ that's what's
driving the dot-com craze.''
</P>
<P>
   Woulda, shoulda, coulda. Hear that lonesome whistle blow.

AMERICANS AREN'T BIG SAVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government just reported that America's personal savings
rate for February was the lowest it's been since the Great
Depression. Is that bad?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad if a person is putting nothing away, running up debt,
and renting.
</P>
<P>
   But it's good if a person is saving in ways not measured by what
many economists consider to be an outmoded government yardstick.
</P>
<P>
   The personal savings rate, 0.8 for February, is figured as a
percentage of disposable income. It's what's left when consumption
is subtracted from the income generated by the nation's production
of goods and services (gross domestic product, or GDP).
</P>
<P>
   While the number includes money saved from income _ such as
savings accounts and 401(k) retirement plans _ it does not include
equity in a home, real estate investments, or capital gains in
stock portfolios. And that last one is where about half of America
is now growing its money.
</P>
<P>
   Like many statistics, the Commerce Department's personal savings
rate is a ghostly outline of society that does not always reflect
the complexities of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the longest-running economic boom in US history,
government statistics indicate Americans are saving less than ever.
While that's not quite true _ Americans are growing their assets
through the stock market and their home equity at record levels _
they are spending more. According to the Commerce Department, US
consumer spending rose 1 percent in February, more than double the
increase in personal income.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are spending more on big-ticket items, including
luxury autos, home electronics, and high-end homes, and using
easily available credit to make those purchases. But many have
learned a tough lesson from those easily obtained credit cards and
the resulting debt.
</P>
<P>
   Take Melanie and Duane Sylvia. They're in their 30s, have three
children, ages 2, 4, and 6, and have successfully climbed out of
the almost $10,000 in credit card debt they had held since the
mid-1980s. They still have nothing saved except for what Duane puts
into a 401(k) account through his job driving a food-delivery
truck. But through scrimping they were able to purchase a house.
</P>
<P>
   They are relentless savers on what might be called ``the drip
scale'' _ those small decisions that add up to a big difference in
the family budget but are never tracked by government radar. They
own one car. They don't buy brand-name clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to go out for pizza every Friday night,'' says
Melanie. ``Now it's once every couple of months. We don't need that
expense. When I go to the store, I think, `Do I really need this?'
Instead of buying the extra sweater or sweatshirt, I leave the
store and sleep on it. I don't usually go back the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sylvias got their fiscal act together through the Consumer
Credit Counseling Service of Southern New England, a nonprofit
organization that assists about 26,000 people a year. The service
analyzes expenses _ ``down to toothpaste, toilet paper, and
stamps,'' says Melanie _ and then sets up a plan to pay back
creditors on a monthly basis. The Sylvias owed nearly $10,000 on a
half-dozen credit cards but paid them off in four years. Now, they
have just one card that is used ``only in the crunch'' of holiday
shopping or emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are chronic undersavers,'' says Debbie Eaton, a vice
president at the counseling service. She says her organization sees
people primarily in the age 35 to 50 range ``who have no
contingency plan if something goes wrong,'' such as job loss or
medical emergency. The current strong economy, she says, feeds the
sense of overconfidence that savings aren't needed.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Kidd, who runs budgeting and credit workshops for Quincy
(Mass.) Community Action Programs, has seen attendance dropping
over the past year. Last week's session, in Randolph, was canceled
for a second time due to lack of interest. Kidd has seen all income
levels in her workshops, run for the past five years, and notes
that high-salaried individuals often have the toughest time saving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see people who earn $120,000 a year who don't save a dime,''
she says, ``and people making $30,000 who manage to put money
away.'' She adds that the most determined people she sees are
single mothers in the Braintree (Mass.) Self-Sufficiency Program
who are struggling to get out of government-subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so anxious to move forward,'' says Kidd. ``They want
to save, and they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychology of why some people save and some don't can be as
convoluted as the human mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't oversimplify this,'' cautions Richard Wagner, past
president of the Financial Planning Association and principal of
the firm WorthLiving LLC in Denver. ``Saving is a psychologically
and spiritually complex act. It depends on your family upbringing
and maybe your dad telling you that anyone who had more than
$10,000 in the bank was a snooty jerk. A person has to get past
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He recommends that people try to save 15 percent of their gross
income, putting it wherever they're comfortable saving. He finds
that his clients are ``generally pretty good about saving,'' and he
considers the government's personal savings rate ``an elusive
number, and an almost useless number.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shapiro, under secretary for economic affairs at the US
Department of Commerce, admits the number is fuzzy, adding that the
government is going to come out with a new savings-rate formula
this year that will include capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to put the number in context,'' he says. ``The
level of personal savings matters in respect to how well people are
prepared for their own futures.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with the caveats, he says the low rate is still
troublesome, because a lot of people are living without a financial
cushion. He notes that the wealth people are accumulating in the
stock market can be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting richer,'' he says, ``but not necessarily
because they're saving. The value of their stock is going up. So
instead of saying, `I need to save $50,000 to send a kid to
college,' they invest $25,000 and watch it grow. Pretty soon it's
$40,000 and they figure they don't have to save as much.''
</P>
<P>
   America is often compared unfavorably to Japan and European
countries, where personal saving rates are traditionally higher.
But observers point out that stock market returns are lower
overseas, and that the adage ``save till it hurts'' is not good
national policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese are saving way too much,'' says Robert Fichter,
senior vice president of the Massachusetts Bankers Association.
``It's almost a compulsion in that society. But Japan's economy
needs more spending. The country is in a very serious recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Fichter says the new economy is redefining the piggy bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not living in the Christmas Club age anymore,'' he says.
``The passbook savings account is not relevant to the world we live
in. Participation in the market may be overzealous, but investors
are sophisticated. Even if we do suffer a downturn, we're not going
back to 1950.''

WASHINGTON REMAINS COOOL TO GLOBAL WARMING ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an issue, global warming is hotter now than ever _ hotter,
that is, everywhere but Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the list of leading players fighting global
warming has exploded. They include countries like France and Great
Britain, organizations like the World Bank and World Economic
Forum, companies like British Petroleum, Shell, General Motors, and
Honda. States and cities are taking action. Even religious groups
are weighing in.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts, chronicled by ever-intensifying media coverage,
have come amid a rush of new scientific findings indicating that
the planet's rising temperature, and the changes to the global
climate it can cause, are serious concerns. The most compelling was
a National Research Council panel finding in January that global
warming ``is undoubtedly real,'' with the rate of temperature
increases accelerating in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Washington, the world's blueprint for solving the problem
_ the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change, a treaty negotiated by more
than 150 countries in 1997 that specifies cuts in greenhouse gas
emissions each country must make _ remains stalled. The White House
has yet to submit it to the Senate for ratification, knowing it
would be rejected. And without US ratification, global
implementation is nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, global warming _ much like the environment
generally _ has yet to emerge as a serious issue on the campaign
trail, despite poll after poll concluding that the environment is
important to voters. A massive effort by environmentalists during
the New Hampshire primary season to raise the issue failed, and _
although George W. Bush last week proposed ways to develop
contaminated ``brownfield'' sites, and Al Gore two weeks ago spoke
about clean water and fuel efficiency _ the candidates have been
largely silent on environmental matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does everyone in the world get this except our own
government?'' said Donella Meadows, author of ``The Limits to
Growth'' and a professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth
College. ``We're the laggards on this issue, the outlaws unwilling
to be dragged into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   This may soon change. Deb Callahan, president of the League of
Conservation Voters, predicts that Vice President Gore is poised to
launch the environment as a campaign issue, and that Governor Bush
will retaliate, both candidates thus casting themselves as
environmentalists, with global warming high on their agenda. White
House sources say privately that Callahan's prediction is correct,
and that the candidates' first tentative comments on the
environment over the past two weeks mark the beginning of a new
phase in which the issue will figure prominently.
</P>
<P>
   Taking up the environment, and especially global warming, would
make political sense; a likely drought this summer in the political
battlefield of the Midwest will put global warming on the front
burner. By that time both Gore and Bush will be scrambling for the
votes of women _ especially those age 25 to 45 _ who are a key
presidential swing constituency and a green voting block. And with
campaign finance in the air, and environmentalists accusing the
coal and oil industries of exerting political influence to thwart
progress on global warming, both candidates can use the issue to
tout their plans to overhaul the political contribution rules.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, the relative silence on the environment has
been nearly deafening _ especially from Gore, who in his 1992 book,
``Earth in the Balance,'' called global warming ``the most serious
threat we have ever faced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore should make an issue of it, he wrote a book about it,
everyone knows where he stands on it, and there's nowhere for him
to run and hide on it,'' said Denis Hayes, chairman and CEO of
Earth Day Network. Its April 22 international celebration of Earth
Day's 30th anniversary is focused on global warming.
</P>
<P>
   But the silence is also predictable, given that both candidates
are vulnerable on the issue of environment. Gore failed in
September to win the endorsement of Friends of the Earth, which
backed Bill Bradley, ``who knows how to get things done,'' said
Brent Blackwelder, the group's president. Gore has been ``a major
disappointment'' over the last seven years, wrongly assuming he
could take the environmental vote for granted, and trying to make
up for that by associating himself with the many high-profile
Clinton administration environmental proposals that have emerged
since, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been heckled on the campaign trail for his oil money
ties _ $500,000 in Occidental Petroleum stock, held as the company
plans to drill in Colombia on the land of the indigenous U'wa
people. His failure to follow through on a 1992 campaign promise to
crack down on an Ohio hazardous waste incinerator has also drawn
jeers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore feels a bit burned right now by the environmental
community, feels he's not getting a clean shot at the issue because
every time he lifts his head up, someone takes a shot at him,''
said Callahan.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has felt the most pressure, environmentalists have
also lambasted Bush for his ties to Texas oil money, his state's
rampant smog, his lack of support for endangered species and public
lands, and other concerns. Bush opposes the protocol, but has come
around to believing that global warming is a real problem,
although, he says, not one necessarily caused by people.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Washington debate over the protocol continues.
White House and Senate staff members say environmentalists are
wrongly viewing it as a panacea, failing to see the broader
legislative efforts both camps are making. Bills, sponsored by some
ardent protocol adversaries, are in the works to launch
multibillion-dollar research and development programs on solar and
wind power, to urge companies and others to voluntarily reduce
their emissions, and other efforts.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed $4.1 billion in direct spending
and tax incentives for global warming solutions, including clean
energy technologies to capitalize on the billions of dollars to be
made exporting them to developing nations like China and India.
Such nations are not subject to the protocol's emission cuts, yet
are industrializing rapidly, one reason the Senate resolved
unanimously in 1997 to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no love lost between the White House and Senate on
this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Each side blames the other for the protocol's slow pace,
although neither seems upset. After all, who would want to take
political credit for emissions cuts that, however popular with
environmentalists, would put an economic dent in the country while
only slowing global warming, not stopping it?

names and colors. Sneaking your mother's lipstick. Your first
lipstick. The lipsticks you tried and traded in high school. The
lipsticks you wore to the prom, at your best friend's wedding, when
you met the love of your life, when you finally pulled yourself
together after he dumped you.
</P>
<P>
   Even nuns wear lipstick, some nuns at least. A discreet dab of
lip color has been allowed since Vatican II, according to Jessica
Pallingston's ``Lipstick: A Celebration of the World's Favorite
Cosmetic'' (St. Martin's Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole book about lipstick?'' my husband asked when he found
me reading Pallingston's book.
</P>
<P>
   I pointed out that he was reading ``The Horse's Health From A to
Z.'' Then I read him a paragraph about Elizabeth Arden, cosmetics
tycoon and Thoroughbred racing enthusiast. In 1966 her obituary in
The New York Times read, ``She treated women like horses and horses
like women.''
</P>
<P>
   That's stated a little ambiguously. I assume the Times meant she
treated both like Thoroughbreds. As far as anyone knows, she didn't
use lipstick on her horses, but she did have her grooms buff them
with other products, notably her famous Eight-Hour Cream, a kind of
glorified Vaseline which, I can attest from long personal
experience, is great over or under lipstick, or on a bare muzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lipstick'' is an entertaining blend of scholarship, pop
culture, and humor. Pallingston delves into the history of
lipstick, as far back as what she calls the First Golden Age of
Lipstick, in ancient Egypt, when blue-black was the favored shade
for women and men. She researched how modern lipsticks are made and
marketed and interviewed experts about how to choose and apply
lipstick. She offers advice on surviving the intimidation of makeup
reps. (I like her observation that walking down cosmetics aisles,
with people spraying you with scent and screaming, ``Can I give you
a makeover?,'' can make you feel ``like a leper wandering the
streets of a medieval village.'')
</P>
<P>
   Pallingston is described as ``a certifiable lipstick addict''
who owns more than 100 tubes, all listed by name, starting with
Taxi Cab, Mermaid, and Fiend, ending with Deadly Nightshade,
Poodle, Whoopee!, and Surrender Dorothy. Why would anyone name a
lipstick Deadly Nightshade? To say nothing of Dominatrix, Bloody
Maria, Roach, Bruise, Plague, or Hot Cross Buns. Pallingston writes
that in many ancient cultures, when you were named, you became your
name. So it is with lipstick. You are what you wear. (It may be
time for a change. I always feel so wimpy asking for another tube
of French Fawn.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, the firm Volupte introduced two new lipsticks, Lady and
Hussy. Pallingston quotes Kathy Peiss, author of ``Hope in a Jar,''
a history of the cosmetics industry: ``Women could choose the look
of gentlewoman or prostitute _ and apparently Hussy outsold Lady
five to one.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipstick is more than color in a tube. It's potent stuff _
sexual, totemic, magic. ``I say lipstick is a primal need,''
Pallingston writes.
</P>
<P>
   She quotes Bill Mandell of Revlon, saying, ``If women didn't
make up, they'd drink.'' It's a condescending observation, but
there may be some truth in it. Lipstick can be addictive.
Pallingston even explores a suggestion that lipstick is a drug
because many women report feeling a powerful rush when they apply
it. After reading ``Lipstick,'' I can understand why they might.

ALBRIGHT'S CHINA CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDOVER, Mass. _ So what's it going to be?
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that a hotbed of the new economy, with a future
intimately linked to exports, will be a symbol of ostrich
protectionism in direct contradiction of New England's economic
interests?
</P>
<P>
   Or, down the stretch toward a defining political moment, are the
region's congressional ``leaders'' going to join the rest of the
region and acknowledge the realities as well as the possibilities
of a new century?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in the auditorium of Agilent Technologies, the
second-largest employer, after Raytheon, in the district of US Rep.
Marty Meehan of Massachusetts. Meehan is the Clinton
administration's biggest gun and brightest star on the trade and
economic issues that are the essence of post-Cold War foreign
policy kicked off the campaign to win congressional approval of
normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright played the advocacy violin
like a virtuoso.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, that meant praising Meehan to the skies to several
hundred of his constituents, calling him ``one of my favorites,''
celebrating his independence, his work ethic, and his deserved
reputation for bipartisan accomplishment in an often gridlocked
Congress. The fact that he is undecided on the China issue at this
early stage of the countdown to a late May vote was given a
respectfully wide berth.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright also made a slam dunk case for making normal
relations with China permanent, no longer subject to annual fights.
In return, China has agreed to a host of concessions in conjunction
with US support for its membership in the 135-nation World Trade
Organization, all involving the opening of its potentially vast
market to US goods and services and the slashing of tariff levels
and other trade barriers. She made it clear that a no vote on trade
relations means forgoing enormous business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Albright picked a perfect place to begin making the
administration's case. Agilent is all cutting-edge technology with
great export growth potential. Already, she noted, it is doing
significant business in China with communications-related products.
</P>
<P>
   But she was also shown some of what is going on in health care _
patient-monitoring equiment, the devices that shock stopped hearts
back into rhythm, all getting smaller and thus portable through the
miracles of electronics. And it just so happens that China agreed
in the deal negotiated last year to slash its tariffs on these
kinds of products by more than half. It is also the case that China
has agreed to open up its its society to the normal distribution
process, enabling exporters to sell, advertise, and service their
products as they do everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   What that means, Albright said, is ``no more forced technology
transfers,'' where firms have to accede to Chinese demands that
they manufacture via joint ventures inside China. Instead of what
amounts to the export of jobs, what is now in prospect is the
export of far more actual products, which is as direct a route to
job creation in this country as there is.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the current system, she noted, exports from
Massachusetts companies to China more than doubled during the
1990s. China's opponents in the United States like to point out
that for all the recent growth, the current trade is no more
important than commerce with Belgium, but this fight is not about
the present; it's about the future.
</P>
<P>
   The economic case is irrefutable. What makes Albright's advocacy
especially helpful in areas with significant numbers of House votes
up for grabs like New England is her unmatched ability to put
economics in the larger context of world affairs and the US
national interest, especially in the absence of a competing
conceptual vision from the labor, environmental, right wing, and
humans rights interests seeeking to ``contain'' or, worse, to
confront China.
</P>
<P>
   She gets attention when she notes that all of America's friends
in China's neighborhood, from Japan and South Korea to Taiwan,
ardently favor its entry into the WTO to foster both trade and
continued change in the country. She gets attention when she notes
that the human rights activists with everything on the line, from
Hong Kong to Beijing itself, feel similarly.
</P>
<P>
   But she gets special attention when she argues forcefully that
the upcoming trade relations decision in Congress offers a choice
between two futures. One offers exciting hope: an accelerated pace
of modernizing change inside China with less central control and a
more global outlook. The other is gloomy, politically and
economically: a virtual Cold War, all the more gloomy because it is
so avoidable.
</P>
<P>
   In a full day of appearances from here to Boston, Albright
underlined how hard she is willing to work to create new
mechanisms, with teeth, for restraining China's worst habits in
economic as well as human rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   But her appearances also underline what a force she is in this
fight. It is not simply because she is secretary of state but also
because she is the first woman to hold the post.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, she offers a protective embrace for those willing
to step forward on this issue. No novice at this, she made it clear
she is happy to play this role in the weeks leading to the critical
votes in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But that should not let New England's congressmen all the way
off the hook. It's time for leaders to show themselves.

WHITEWASHING CASTRO'S CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two days before Elian Gonzalez's father arrived in the United
States last week, NBC aired a preview of the boy's future if he is
taken back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   From Havana, reporter Jim Avila began with the ``exclusive
neighborhood'' where Elian's father lives and the ``good jobs in
the local government'' held by members of his family. (Juan Miguel
Gonzalez is a hotel cashier.) ``If and when Elian returns,'' Avila
said, ``he will become a 4-foot-tall deity in a country that
officially does not believe in God. . . . His home, a two-bedroom
converted garage that has been re-painted and improved by the
government, is comfortable. Here he has his own room, a luxury in
housing-short Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   That was just the warm-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian's future here is likely to be the Cuban good life lived
by Communist Party elite,'' Avila gushed, ``with perks like five
free gallons of gasoline a month for the family, and a Cuban
tradition called `La Jaba' _ the bag _ which includes extra rice,
beans, cooking oil, and sundries like deodorant, shampoo, razors,
and shaving cream; about $15 a month worth of basics. Plus,
invitations reserved for the party elite to cultural events,
sports, discos, and restaurants, access to the best medicine,
expensive drugs . . . not available to everyone in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   As Brent Baker of the Media Research Center _ whose
treasure-trove of a Web site, www.mrc.org, transcribed much of
Avila's report _ acidly comments: ``Wow. How could anyone resist
the promise of $15 worth of shampoo, deodorant, and rice in a
bag?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a strange kind of journalism that describes a converted
garage and a bag of groceries as ``perks'' of the ``good life''
enjoyed by the ``elite.'' Strange _ but familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years of communism have turned Cuba into a tropical
hellhole, a land where life is so miserable that each year
thousands of people risk everything to escape. Half of them meet
the fate that befell 11 of the 13 refugees who were in the boat
with Elian last fall. Yet time and again, journalists paint a
glowing picture of Cuban society.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Kathleen Sullivan of CBS spent two days broadcasting
from Cuba. The lack of freedom or democracy on the island she
mentioned only in passing; her reports were filled instead with
upbeat paeans to Fidel Castro's supposed achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clinic,'' she enthused in one segment. ``It is the
heart of a health care system which has been called a `revolution
within a revolution.' Of all the promises made by Fidel Castro in
1959, perhaps the boldest was to provide quality health care free
for every citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   The island's young people, Sullivan declared, ``all have
benefited from Castro's Cuba.'' She interviewed only supporters of
the regime, such as Sandra Levinson of the Center for Cuban
Studies, who groused that ``there are a lot of young people who
simply cannot appreciate . . . what the revolution has given
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That was nothing next to the sugar-coating that Giselle
Fernandez, also of CBS, gave Cuba a few years later: ``Welcome to
Fidel Castro's playground, Cuban's Caribbean paradise. Cuba and its
sultry beaches have become a major vacation hot spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez didn't note that human rights organization identify
the Castro regime as one of the world's most represssive, or
explain how the state uses prostitution to attract hard currency.
She did reveal, though, that ``along Havana's famous seafront, a
proud tradition of honoring a revolutionary hero is passed on to a
new generation of Cubans. They sing songs of socialism, songs of
tribute to Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   This journalistic swoon for Castro has a flip side. If the
Bearded One's rule is romantic and admirable, those who oppose him
must be crude and distasteful. Which pretty much sums up the way
Castro's fervent opponents _ especially those in Florida _ have
been described throughout the Elian affair.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggest ``that it's wrong to expect Elian Gonzalez to live
in a place that tolerates no dissent or freedom of political
expression,'' a sarcastic Katie Couric opened NBC's ``Today'' show
one day last week. ``They were talking about Miami.'' Over on ABC,
John Quinones complained that in Miami ``everything is colored by a
hatred of communism and Fidel Castro. It's a community with very
little tolerance for those who might disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Crossfire,'' Bill Press compared the mayor of Miami _ who
said the city's police would refuse to drag Elian from his
relatives' home _ to Orville Faubus and George Wallace, two
segregationist governors of the Jim Crow South. Time magazine's Tim
Padgett reached for the ultimate anti-communist bogeyman; the Miami
relatives' spokesman, he wrote, has ``a heavy touch of Joe McCarthy
in him.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an old, old story. The journalist Lincoln Steffens went to
the Soviet Union in 1919 _ when the Red Terror was butchering
people by the tens of thousands _ and reported: ``I have seen the
future, and it works!' He was the first in a long line of
journalists to whitewash the crimes of communist tyrants and
minimize the anguish of their victims.
</P>
<P>
   One day Castro's brutality will end. But that end will not be
hastened by the Western press, which cannot seem to shed its esteem
for Fidelismo. If you want to know what awaits Elian back in Cuba,
you shouldn't be watching NBC.

`TALK' IS CHEAP: KYRA SEDGWICK LOWERS HER SIGHTS WITH NEW SITCOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kyra Sedgwick scampers through ``Talk to Me'' as though she's
been heavily coached on How To Succeed in Slapstick Sitcoms By
Really, Really Trying. The main lesson learned: Do everything very
quickly. She talks loud and fast and often, and in the spirit of
recent female sitcom leads, she's needy and clingy and unsure of
herself _ even though by episode's end, we're supposed to believe
she is actually strong and secure and independent.
</P>
<P>
   Likable and certainly believable in film roles, where she
typically stands her ground, Sedgwick has traded all that in for
Janey Munro, a radio talk-show host who is popular because she's
``funny, irreverent and sometimes controversial,'' although humor,
irreverence and controversy are nowhere to be found in the two
episodes of ``Talk to Me'' sent for review, the first of which airs
Tuesday on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   What supposedly makes Janey's show such a hot ticket is the way
she shoots from the lip about her life and loves and opinions, most
of which stand in direct contrast to her radio-booth sidekicks, all
of whom are testosterone-laced lugs.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot episode finds Janey feeling lousy about feeling lousy
over yet another breakup (the scum fell for another woman) and
vowing to ``act like a man'' _ which means to get over it by not
discussing it or thinking about it and, of course, by sleeping
around.
</P>
<P>
   And so Janey then spends the half-hour playing the gender-war
games while at the same time making the point (rather meekly) that
women hurt and can't move on after relationships because they have,
well, feelings. (Actually, I've always thought that women were
better at breakups because with them, when it's done, it's
``done,'' whereas men often wake up sometime later wondering what
the heck hit them.)
</P>
<P>
   In the second episode, when Janey flirts with a woman
(model-turned-actress Paulina Porizkova) to prove to one of her
co-workers that sex between two women is stimulating to ``all''
men, it turns out that the woman Janey is hitting on is gay, and
since she can't possibly hurt the woman's feelings by telling her
that she doesn't play in that particular league, they ``date.''
Which, after they have a great time hanging out, leads to yet
another ``Talk to Me'' revelation: If only women were equipped
with, well, you know, life would be good.
</P>
<P>
   Janey is joined in the booth by Rob (David Newsom), her co-host
and longtime friend; Marshall (Max Baker), who specializes in sound
effects and one-liners; and Cam (Michael J. Estine), the show's
producer.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jacobson is Sandy, the often-dissed program director.
(He's saddled with a double whammy: He gets no respect because he's
the station owner's son and because he's such a dweeb.) Janey's
radio gang also dumps on self-help host Dr. Debra (Beverly
D'Angelo), yet another dig at radio host Dr. Laura Schlessinger.
Rude and rigid, Dr. Debra's favorite line before hanging up on
listeners is ``Get over your darn self.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, Janey lives with her sister, Kat (the hilarious Nicole
Sullivan from ``Mad TV''), who appears to be some kind of
professional volunteer, if that makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the supporting characters, this is definitely
Janey's show. And Sedgwick, whose recent film credits include
``Something to Talk About'' and ``Phenomenon,'' is up to the
challenge. She gives a performance that, considering the lack of
good material here, is a model of team playing. If the supporting
characters were original and the lines funnier and more
sophisticated, she'd be courting comparisons to Marlo Thomas'
``That Girl'' instead of Brooke Shields' ``Suddenly Susan.''
</P>
<P>
   But sadly, the show prefers gimmicks to quality storytelling.
Gene Simmons, for example, appears in the premiere episode as
himself, a guest-star device ``Talk to Me'' will no doubt continue
to take advantage of. Produced by Suzanne Martin, who spent nearly
three seasons on the staff of ``Frasier,'' ``Talk to Me'' _ which
takes over the ``Sports Night'' time slot for the remainder of the
season _ needs to get funny fast.
</P>
<P>
   If not, Sedgwick will find what other film stars have found when
slumming on the tube: TV can be a ruthless place.

GORE'S ERROR IN FLORIDA COUD YET COST HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite intense media coverage, the Elian Gonzalez saga was not
a real factor in this year's presidential campaign _ until Vice
President Al Gore made it one, to his detriment.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls showed that the public wanted the 6-year-old boy,
rescued in November from the sea in which his mother drowned on a
perilous boat voyage from Cuba, returned to his father back home.
Instead, Elian's distant relatives in Miami have laid claim to him
to ``save'' him from life in a communist country.
</P>
<P>
   They have been loudly backed by the 800,000-strong
Cuban-American community in Florida, but most of the rest of the
country did not join in on their behalf. Yet Gore, who has been
virtually tied with Texas Governor George W. Bush in the national
polls and appeared to be getting even stronger against his
Republican rival, inexplicably waded into the volatile issue,
siding with the Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore said Elian and his immediate family should be granted
permanent-resident status in the United States, he broke with both
President Clinton and the administration's view that it is in the
child's best interest to return him to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits promptly faulted Gore for ``pandering'' to
Cuban-Americans to win votes.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who look to Gore to continue Clinton's policies felt
betrayed. Among them are many African-Americans, whose anger was
given voice by US Representative Maxine Waters of California. She
said that the only reason she could see for Gore's move was to win
votes in a state in which George W. Bush (whose brother Jeb is
Florida's governor) had an edge. Waters, a Democrat, said she was
uncertain whether she could continue to support Gore's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's move could cost him votes. He now stands with many
Cuban-Americans _ who still may not vote for him in November. He
has prompted a negative reaction from African-Americans, liberals,
and other Clinton supporters who see him as more opportunistic than
principled.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean Democrats are going to rush to back Bush.
More probable, they will simply stay home on election day. And that
could hurt Gore's chances. In a close race, turnout will matter for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between a 50 percent and a 70 percent turnout of
black voters, for example, could spell the difference between
victory and defeat in some states, and it could well determine the
next president.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Gore, Bush has not been hurt by the Elian issue. From the
start, he said he would prefer that the child remain in the United
States. But that statement apparently was expected from Bush and
was low-key enough not to generate controversy. Gore's action _
going against Clinton and most of the president's, and his own,
political base _ was as unexpected as it was unwise.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps realizing his political mistake, Gore has tried to
backpedal. He also has avoided talking about the issue, remaining
silent about it on his recent trip to Florida to discuss the future
of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   With a large number of elderly voters living in Florida, Gore
might be hoping for their support, which Clinton got when he won
Florida in 1996. Gore has now made that task more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   And he might have lost some support in New York, where Hillary
Rodham Clinton is running for the US Senate. It may be more
difficult for Gore to campaign with her since she had earlier
agreed with the president and US Attorney General Janet Reno that
Elian should be reunited with his father in Cuba. That view seemed
to resonate with New York voters.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of her Republican rival, New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who did himself no favors with his poor handling of two
fatal police shootings of African-Americans _ Clinton has pulled
ahead in that race for the first time, according to the latest
polls.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States works its way toward returning Elian
Gonzalez to Cuba with his father, Gore needs to work his way back
into the embrace of his core supporters. He may need to call
national meeting of key backers to acknowledge that he was briefly
lost but now is found.
</P>
<P>
   Gore cannot afford any more such mistakes. If he makes any, even
the still popular Clinton might not be able to save him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore can only hope that Bush makes a similar strategic gaffe
during the campaign _ one that will remind Democratic voters about
the consequences of elevating the Texas governor to the presidency.

   The 10% Dissolution
</P>
<P>
   Q. My agent hit on me in an aggressive, annoying way. I should
have fired him but a project was pending, and to my regret, I
decided not to. The project was awarded to me and I had only to
sign the contract when he hit on me again. This time, I fired him.
The next day I was off the project. Should I tell his wife what a
scum he is? Is revenge so bad?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous, New York
</P>
<P>
   A. You should not call your former agent's wife. You'd be
directing your anger at an innocent person, and besides, such a
call would probably be ineffectual. If she is unaware of her
husband's character, a single phone call from a stranger is not apt
to enlighten her. In any case, you should not pursue cheap (albeit
enormously tempting) revenge of any sort; you should seek justice.
</P>
<P>
   While your ex-agent's behavior does not meet the definition of
sexual harassment for Title VII _ he was not your employer _ he may
have violated your professional relationship in ways that a lawsuit
can remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be worth it for a person in her situation to have a
consultation with a lawyer,'' says Anne Vladeck of Vladeck,
Waldman, Elias &AMP; Engelhard, a firm that specializes in employment
law.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he may well have violated the civil rights laws of
your city or state; contact the appropriate agencies. And you can
certainly talk to your former agent's boss, who, if he knows you
will not merely let the matter drop, may be anxious to resolve it
promptly. The one thing you should not do is passively accept this
treatment. While you may understandably want to put this
unpleasantness behind you and simply find a new agent, it would be
exemplary if you could give a thought to the next client who'll
walk through this guy's door. Take action now, and you may spare
someone else the same mistreatment you received.
</P>
<P>
   Q. While on the Long Island Railroad, I spilled a cup of coffee
on the floor and had little to mop it up with. I warned my close
neighbors to get their bags off the floor, but I could hear
passengers muttering and cursing. Should I have asked those
affected for their names and dry cleaning bills, or should I have
just skulked off the train?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.N., Wantagh, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. You are responsible for cleaning up your own mess. If you
spilled coffee on a co-worker's sweater at the office, you'd
certainly offer to get it cleaned. Your obligation doesn't change
because you've besmirched many people or because they are
strangers, even on the railroad. When you spilled your coffee, you
should have stood up and, despite the risk of embarrassment, warned
everyone to get their bags off the floor. Then you should have
found the conductor and asked for a mop. Were you too late with the
mop, you should have asked for dry cleaning bills. To avoid just
such mishaps, many transit systems, including the New York subways,
thoughtfully discourage passengers from drinking or eating on the
train _ especially elaborate dishes with rich sauces accompanied by
many bottles of wine. They stain.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The head of my academic department is stepping down and we
are all being asked to sign a card saying job well done. But I
think the job has been done very poorly. How do I choose between
the honesty in not signing and the camaraderie in participating?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous, Arizona
</P>
<P>
   A. Dr. Johnson, that most punctilious of men, ruled on this more
than 200 years ago: ''In lapidary inscriptions a man is not upon
oath.'' So err on the side of generosity: sign the card, and
delight in the fellow's departure.

DIVORCE TRIGGERED N.H. JUDICIAL SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The whole thing started with a bitter
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures of alleged judicial misconduct that have rocked
New Hampshire began with the acrimonious divorce of former Supreme
Court justice Stephen Thayer and his wife, Judith Thayer.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce was a small snow-slide at the top of a mountain. But
the revelations that divorce proceedings brought to light have
turned into a roaring avalanche threatening to topple the top level
of the state's judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Albert ``Buzz'' Scherr, an associate dean and professor of law
at Franklin Pierce Law Center, likened the situation to the White
House scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about the Clinton impeachment thing,'' Scherr said.
``Nationally, that's the equivalent. It all came about because of
this stupid little Whitewater thing that turned out to be not much
of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Scherr said Stephen Thayer is ``not a bad person. He got in a
set of circumstances in a time of his life when he made some bad
decisions. And look what's resulted from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Thayer resigned from the Supreme Court March 31 rather
than face a grand jury investigation into allegations he tried to
influence cases in which he had an interest, including his own
divorce. The state Legislature will consider this week whether to
open impeachment proceedings against Chief Justice David Brock. And
some are calling for a clean sweep of the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Already, as a result of the fallout from this case, the Supreme
Court has instituted rules of recusal, and justices' outside
incomes have been capped. A proposal is at hand to investigate the
divorces of other New Hampshire judges.
</P>
<P>
   But the divorce that started the avalanche was the one that
ended the pairing of Stephen and Judith Thayer, who had seemed to
be ideological soulmates.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Thayer, who was regarded as the most conservative jurist
on the state's high court, had a relatively rapid rise to the top
of the New Hampshire legal community. After spending three years in
Vietnam and earning a Bronze Star, he got his law degree from John
Marshall in Chicago in 1974. Not long after his arrival in New
Hampshire, he became an early backer of Ronald Reagan's effort to
win the 1976 presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Reagan appointed Thayer US attorney for New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Thayer was active in the same conservative Republican
circles.
</P>
<P>
   They married two days after Christmas in 1982 and had one son,
W. Stephen Thayer IV. With Judith Thayer's two daughters from a
previous marriage, they lived in Manchester's North End, home to
many of the state's legal and political movers and shakers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the same year that Governor John H. Sununu appointed
Thayer to the state Supreme Court, he appointed Judith Thayer to
her first term on the State Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   She was appointed its chairwoman by former governor and now US
Senator Judd Gregg. Through her unpaid but highly visible post, she
championed such measures as a proposal to drop minimum state
standards for public schools and institute ``character education.''
Some recall her style in that post as abrasive and confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   Their son attended private boarding school, and Stephen Thayer
earned more than $100,000 a year as a Supreme Court justice and, in
one year, another $91,000 from teaching.
</P>
<P>
   But financial troubles began for the family in 1985, according
to their final divorce decree. By the time Judith Thayer filed for
divorce in 1998, the couple had incurred significant credit card
debt. A judge ordered their house sold. In court, Stephen Thayer
acknowledged that the pair ran some $17,000 in the red every year.
</P>
<P>
   But Judith Thayer maintained she was kept in the dark about the
family's finances.
</P>
<P>
   The court found both Thayers ``responsible for living beyond
their means.''
</P>
<P>
   A partial transcript of the divorce proceedings in Hillsborough
County Superior Court reads:
</P>
<P>
   Judith Thayer: ``I really don't understand where the money
went.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Thayer: ``She told me it's a man's job to provide. She
wanted to play tennis, and do her prayer group.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Thayer: ``I asked for 15 years why our finances are
managed this way . . . and I was told that if I didn't like it, I
could leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Thayer: ``We had difficulty talking about finances . . .
It was yelling and screaming, and nothing was resolved . . . (It)
was really a source of chaos in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during divorce proceedings that Stephen Thayer's failure
to report a $50,000 loan he had received from Manchester lawyer
Emile Bussiere came to light. The state's Judicial Conduct
Committee and the FBI both investigated; Thayer was cleared by the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But when the divorce was appealed to the New Hampshire Supreme
Court _ the state doesn't have a separate appeals court _ the
avalanche picked up speed.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer's fellow jurists recused themselves from hearing his
divorce case. But when Thayer allegedly tried to wield influence
over which justices would hear his divorce _ and when Chief Justice
David Brock allegedly listened _ the court clerk reported the
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Philip McLaughlin launched an investigation
that led to Thayer's resignation, to Brock's possible impeachment,
and to the revelation of a long-standing practice of judges
commenting on cases from which they had been recused.
</P>
<P>
   David Nixon, who first represented Judith Thayer, said the
divorce ``was acrimonious from the start.'' He said he ``cautioned
everybody. . . from the beginning. . . everybody involved'' of the
potential implications of the divorce being played out on a public
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``As part of any lawyer's obligations, I think you try to steer
your clients in the direction that is in their best interest. . .
some of this information that we were obtaining through depositions
and discovery shed light on some of these loans that Mrs. Thayer
wasn't aware of,'' Nixon said. ``I thought that sooner or later
that would reflect badly on both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, his cautions didn't seem to have much effect.
</P>
<P>
   He said the couple attempted mediation, ``but it got nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Kamasinski, a non-lawyer currently representing Judith
Thayer, said she would have been willing to settle if a reasonable
offer had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, (Judge) Thayer didn't do what most men in his
situation do _ offer a generous settlement and shut up,'' said
Marcus Hurn, a law professor at Franklin Pierce Law School.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce, as it would play out under a white-hot spotlight,
turned operatic.
</P>
<P>
   Under a court order, the Thayers' 17-room house was sold.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during court proceedings in October, the Thayers'
15-year-old son stood and confronted his father in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks a lot, Dad,'' the boy yelled sarcastically. ``Thanks a
lot for everything you've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Thayer refused to leave the family home, claiming the
judge had no authority to order the sale before the final divorce
hearing. She was inside with her daughters and other family members
when sheriff's deputies broke open the front door. Thayer and her
daughters were put out into the October rain.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time a high-profile divorce among the
state's legal elite has taken center stage.
</P>
<P>
   The case calls to mind an earlier acrimonious divorce involving
fomer state Supreme Court justice Charles G. ``Chuck'' Douglas III
and his fourth wife, Caroline. That case was fodder for national
magazines and inspired a TV drama loosely based on it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Douglas and Mrs. Thayer have said they found it nearly
impossible to find representation in their divorce proceedings,
citing the state's ``old-boy'' legal network and lawyers' fear of
retaliation from the bench. Many in the state's legal community
deny those allegations; but both women have ended up being advised
and represented by Kamasinski, who describes himself as a ``legal
reformer.''
</P>
<P>
   Thayer, through Kamasinski, has asked the court to put her
divorce appeal on hold. Caroline Douglas has asked for a new trial.
On Friday, Stephen Thayer asked that his child support and alimony
payments be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, Judith Thayer's first lawyer, said he was ``saddened to
the point of being sickened by the whole thing. There's no pleasure
to me in seeing what I feared and predicted come true.''

POLITICIANS PUSH FOR BABY ABANDONMENT AT `SAFE' SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jennifer Layton, a soft-spoken, stay-at-home mother, says that
politicians just don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   She looks at one of the hottest legislative trends in the United
States today _ combatting baby abandonment with the establishment
of ``safe havens'' at which distraught young women can anonymously
drop their newborns _ and her blood boils.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds absolutely wonderful,'' said Layton, who was adopted
after being left in a trash can in a Boston hotel 29 years ago when
she was a few days old. ``But it's absolutely outrageous. It
devalues life, it condemns the child to a lifetime of not knowing
about herself, and it won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many infants are abandoned in this country each
year, and no professional concensus has developed on how to deal
with them. But a rapidly growing number of politicians nationwide
think they've found a solution: establishing facilities where
teenagers, who constitute the vast majority of the parents
involved, can leave their babies with no questions asked and no
risk of being prosecuted, as people usually are if they are
suspected of deserting a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these girls are given another option, I believe they won't
panic and just dump the baby,'' said Representative Ann Dandrow, a
GOP legislator who has sponsored ``safe haven'' legislation in
Connecticut. ``We'd be preventing a crime, maybe saving a baby's
life, and definitely freeing up more children for adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in response to a spate of widely publicized
abandonments, Texas became the first state to legalize anonymous
baby drop-offs at specified locations such as police stations,
firehouses, and emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has spread like wildfire since then.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia's governor signed such a bill last month, Colorado
and Minnesota are in the final stages of enactment, and similar
measures are pending in more than 20 other states.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is the only New England state considering such a
law.
</P>
<P>
   While advocates of this approach maintain it could save some
babies' lives and help resolve a traumatic dilemma for distressed
young women, it has numerous detractors outside the political
arena. Many mental-health and child-care professionals regard it as
a reflexive response that is well-intentioned, but could cause more
problems than it solves.
</P>
<P>
   They say that nearly all the affected teenagers feel so confused
and upset, or are in such deep denial, that they're highly unlikely
to drive or seek a ride to any prescribed site, much less one
occupied by authority figures such as police. None of the nine
babies abandoned in Texas since its law went into effect was
dropped at a designated site, but six of them were left in the
hospitals at which they were delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, citing extensive research showing that adoptees
develop healthier mentally if they can learn about their personal
histories, grass-roots organizations such as the American Adoption
Congress and an adoptee-rights group called Bastard Nation are
aggressively opposing legalized baby desertion because it nearly
guarantees the children will never have access to information about
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about desertion, we're not talking about girls
who are thinking rationally . . . and that's what these laws expect
them to do,'' said Susan Dark, director of the Adoption Connection
in Peabody, Mass. For 25 years, the organization has helped
thousands of adoptees, including some who had been abandoned,
search for their biological families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, we shouldn't be thinking only of the moment,'' Dark
added. ``These girls can change their minds. . . . and their babies
are living, breathing people who will grow up, and who have a right
to ask questions and get the answers, who have a right to an
identity, who have a right to a medical history.''
</P>
<P>
   The critics say that politicians, in their zeal to deal with an
emotional and high-profile issue, are emulating an approach the
United States criticizes in other countries. Government-sanctioned
abandonment occurs most frequently in China, where little girls are
dropped at orphanages because families are legally permitted to
have only one child.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest long-term risk in this country, according to
detractors, is that it will convince young mothers facing
less-than-dire circumstances that it's a socially acceptable way of
resolving a tough problem. And that, they fear, could lead to more
teen pregnancies and abandonments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not designed to be a prevention program, but to save
the life of a child who's already here,'' countered Justin Unruh,
director of the Baby Moses Project in Texas, which is developing a
program to inform teenagers about that state's new law. ``And we
would rather have a child without any background or medical history
who is safe than one who is without any background or medical
history who is found in a dumpster.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither individual states nor the federal government track how
many infants are discarded each year. The closest thing to an
official estimate is in an unpublished survey conducted by the US
Department of Health and Human Services, which based its data on
print and television news stories.
</P>
<P>
   The department counted 65 babies abandoned in public places in
1991, including eight found dead, or an average of 1.3 abandoned
per state; in 1998, the tally rose to 105, with 33 dead, or 2.1 per
state. Some analysts say that the abandonment probably hasn't
grown, but reporting has become more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   Some professionals say they understand why the safe haven
initiative has proliferated and contend it probably is an
overreaction, one with consequences its sponsors haven't
considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea may have some merit, but it does seem like a
knee-jerk reaction,'' said John Krall, chief analyst for the
National Abandoned Infants Research Center at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``It probably feels like a good idea to
people, and may even help a baby in some isolated cases, . . . but
I think it has a lot of pitfalls and certainly doesn't even try to
address the root causes of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Mental-health specialists suggest that, as long as social
stigmas relating to teenage and unwed pregnancy exist, the
strongest safeguard against baby abandonment is education. They
added that parents and teachers need to get more involved, both to
promote prenatal care and to help the mothers-to-be cope with the
emotional turmoil so they can rationally decide whether to keep
their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most promising response is public awareness, to
get more young people to know there's someone to talk to, to
counsel them, that there's someone to help them make decisions in
everyone's best interests,'' said Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for
the Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and
Family.
</P>
<P>
   Some professionals suggest that hospital- and clinic-based
programs are preferable to safe havens. The thinking is that if
young women were encouraged to enter hospitals _ perhaps with
guarantees of privacy, protection, and free care _ they and their
babies would be healthier; they would have access to their infants
if they changed their minds about parenting; and the children,
along with their adoptive parents, would later have access to
genealogical and medical information.
</P>
<P>
   The unpublished Health and Human Services study, a copy of which
was provided to the Globe, indicates the benefits of such an
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Most abandonments have historically taken place in hospitals,
which keep track of their numbers. There were 22,000 nationwide in
1991 and 31,000 in 1998, the ovewhelming majority involving mothers
with drug-dependency problems. None of the children died, and
nearly all are believed to have been returned to their mothers
after the parents were rehabilitated, to be in the custody of other
relatives, or to have been adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters of the legalized-abandonment approach said they
understood it might have some flaws, but insisted that something
had to be done, even if only as an initial response.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take things in steps, and I truly believe this is
the important first step,'' Dandrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many babies are abandoned in Connecticut each year,
she said she didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there have been some, and if we save even one baby's
life, it's worth it,'' she added.

   !! 1/2 ``Black and White'' James Toback's film about rich white
kids trying to be black rappers and black rappers trying to become
show-biz power brokers has ambition, ideas, edge, and good
performances by two athletes: boxer Mike Tyson and basketballer
Allan Houston. But it can't finish what it starts, and veers off
into spiralingly inane melodrama. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Return to Me'' Likable fluff, marking the directing debut
of actress Bonnie Hunt. The romantic comedy is driven by warm,
engaging performances from David Duchovny as a depressed widower
and Minnie Driver as a shy artist. Neither realizes that she's the
recipient of his late wife's transplanted heart. This one wants to
be another ``Moonstruck,'' but settles for a lot of Dean Martin on
the soundtrack. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``Rules of Engagement'' This military-combat thriller and
courtroom drama has its moments, most of them involving Samuel L.
Jackson. He's the Marine colonel rescuing an endangered ambassador
and his family from a besieged US embassy in Yemen. But after his
unit returns fire, killing women and children, he's hung out to dry
in a politically motivated trial. Neither Jackson nor Tommy Lee
Jones, as the colonel's old buddy and defense lawyer, can defend
himself from their ill-defined characters in a sketchy script. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Southpaw'' Involving, home-grown documentary about scrappy
Irish welterweight boxer Francis Barrett, who was cheered by his
countrymen for representing Ireland in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics
before he was accepted as a Traveller living in a trailer outside
Galway. The hardships he faces in trying to establish himself as a
boxer make it clear that his toughest fights are outside the ring.
(Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``X'' This Japanese animation drawn by the four-woman
collective known as Clamp is perfunctory about its characters and
its good-versus-evil showdown. Making most of its points on the
illustrative rather than the human level, it's driven by dark,
grandiose, nightmare images of Tokyo reduced to rubble. (R)

REGIS WARGNIER'S JOURNEY TO FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a child, film director Regis Wargnier was intrigued with
secrets _ more than anything, with the things adults tried to keep
hidden from him. Growing up in France in the 1950s and '60s,
foremost in the young boy's mind was the massive, impenetrable veil
that separated his world from mysterious millions who lived on the
other side. ``The USSR was a locked world then,'' recalls Wargnier,
``and I really thought there was this huge curtain made of iron. I
wanted to know who are these people? Why are they so dangerous? Why
do they live behind the Iron Curtain?' Somehow, I kept that with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, Wargnier has transposed his lifelong
fascination to film. ``East-West,'' starring Sandrine Bonnaire,
Oleg Menchikov, and Catherine Deneuve, was nominated for an Academy
Award for best foreign language film this year; it lost to Pedro
Almodovar's ``All About My Mother.'' The film, which opens in
Boston on Friday, tells the story of Alexei Golovine, a young
Russian doctor living in France, who returns to his mother country
with his French wife and young son at the behest of Stalin, who in
1946 launched a propaganda campaign to lure emigrants back with the
promise of amnesty, a Soviet passport, and the chance to
participate in postwar reconstruction. Upon their arrival in
Odessa, the family quickly discovers that Stalin's promises were
empty. Alexei is posted to the infirmary in a textile factory in
Kiev, and the family is allocated a single room in a communal
apartment in Kiev. So begins a long, painful quest for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   It's that journey toward freedom _ be it political, social, or
psychological _ that drives Wargnier's films. ``Yes, I think I am
freedom, or liberty, obsessed,'' says the director, chatting in a
conference room at the Lenox Hotel. Only one of his films has been
shown in the States: ``Indochine,'' which won the Oscar for best
foreign-language film. But all five resonate, Wargnier says, with
the same theme: ``You don't get caught by a story like
(``East-West'') if it doesn't mean something deep, very deep, to
you. It's independence. What is it to be free? If you want to be
free, do you have to pay for it?''
</P>
<P>
   The story began to take shape in Wargnier's mind in 1995, when
he was traveling in a former republic of the Soviet Union to
research an adventure film that was never made. While there, he was
surprised to meet some locals speaking French. ``They told me, `Oh,
we speak French because we were born in France, and lived there
until we were 9 or 10.' Their fathers were Russian and mothers were
French, and the father wanted to go back home. They were like the
little boy in the movie, plus 45 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Wargnier was intrigued, to say the least. He called a close
friend who lived for a time in the former Soviet Union many years
before. That friend relayed another story of a couple he met in the
town he lived in: a Russian man who had returned home with a French
wife. They fought for 40 years to get back to France. ``The opening
scene is, in a way, what happened to them,'' Wargnier says. ``It's
not a true story, but it's from several true stories we put
together.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The plot thickens
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wargnier co-wrote the screenplay with two Russian collaborators,
Rustam Ibragimbekov and Serguei Bodrov, and a fellow French scribe,
Louis Gardel. It was not easy, Wargnier confirms, to gather
firsthand reports from the people who lived through it. ``You know,
they keep distant. You can change lots of things, but you can't
change the mentality. You can't just take out the frame of mind. It
was like somebody said to them, `oh, we have news for you. God is
dead. We made a great mistake. This regime? The laws and rules?
Dead. Sorry. Just go on with your life.' But these people have been
taught that we are the enemy. You are, I am, we, the westerners. We
are really mistrusted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``East-West'' is not a true story, Wargnier says, but rather
several true stories blended into one. The unifying thread was a
common strength of spirit, a truly altruistic urge to survive. ``I
was sitting in a Moscow cafe with my co-writer, Serguei,'' Wargnier
recalls. ``His friend was there, who had been 10 years in a camp.
It was like the Olympic runner with the torch at the opening
ceremonies; he's content to pass the torch to someone else. He said
that almost every day they heard that somebody had escaped. Or they
knew that in the next room someone was preparing to escape. This
hope stuff, or freedom stuff, it works even if it's for someone
else. He said you didn't need to get it for yourself if you were
sure someone was getting it. Sometimes they were all trying to give
a hand to someone else, and that was keeping them alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Wargnier's first film, 1986's ``The Woman in My Life,'' was a
low-budget independent about a neurotic relationship _ the battle
for liberation waged on an internal landscape. Then came ``I Am the
King of the Castle,'' a gothic tale of two kids engaged in war with
each other. In ``Indochine,'' which also starred Catherine Deneuve,
a young Vietnamese rebels against her mother as her country rebels
against France. And in 1994's ``A French Woman,'' starring
Emmanuelle Beart, Wargnier told the story (based on his mother's
experience) of a military officer's wife trying desperately to find
her own life.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``East-West,'' Wargnier says, ``it's the most obvious.
It's about basics. In USSR, liberty number one was denied: to go
where you want to go, talk to who you want to talk, love who you
want to love.'' He hopes that US audiences will walk away from the
film with an increased awareness of just how tenuous those basic
freedoms are. ``Some people in France think `Oh, the Berlin wall
has fallen down 10 years so it belongs to the past,''' Wargnier
says. ``No. History is in the present. The more dangerous walls are
the invisible walls. Like in Austria, where the right wing is
growing. Every day, somewhere, people are being oppressed. There
won't ever be enough movies to deal with this.''

THE MAKING OF `THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The presidency is the apogee of political ambition, the symbol
of a nation, an exalted office that Al Gore and George W. Bush will
spend untold millions pursuing over the next seven months.
</P>
<P>
   It is also, to hear many of its occupants tell it, one of the
lousiest jobs on earth. Even John F. Kennedy, who usually reveled
in the role of president, got so fed up at the woes mounting around
him in the summer of 1961 that one night he growled jokingly to
reporter Hugh Sidey: ``I'm going to give this damn job to Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidey, Time magazine's longtime White House correspondent,
chuckled at the recollection, as if to say he knows exactly how
many grains of salt should be taken with such presidential laments.
``Every one of these guys, starting with Kennedy . . . they want to
be heroic presidents,'' said Sidey, who has retired from the beat.
``They all kind of want that greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two centuries, that ``damn job'' offering a chance
at greatness has been held by 41 men _ all of whom are profiled in
PBS's 10-hour series ``The American President,'' at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the first documentary series to offer a portrait of
every single president, it is narrated by Sidey and written,
produced, and directed by the father-and-sons team of Philip B.
Kunhardt Jr., Philip B. Kunhardt III, and Peter W. Kunhardt. Philip
B. Kunhardt III said the goal of the series is to show ``how much
their individual personalities have brought to bear on the
evolution of the office.''
</P>
<P>
   The series boasts interviews with all the living ex-presidents,
except for Ronald Reagan, who is afflicted with Alzheimer's
disease. The current White House occupant, Bill Clinton, discusses
his impeachment in an episode titled ``The Balance of Power,''
slated to air Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As for the presidents no longer living, the series opted not to
take the usual route of relying on actors to supply the voices.
Instead, ``The American President'' features a roster of military,
political, and media types that includes former governor William F.
Weld (in the voice of another one-time Bay State governor, Calvin
Coolidge), General Colin Powell, former senator Robert Dole, Walter
Cronkite, George Will, Tim Russert, the Rev. Billy Graham, and Don
Imus. (Imus accepted the role of Andrew Johnson, a white
supremacist and the first president to be impeached, after five
others had turned it down. Among those rejecting the role was Pat
Buchanan, who sent back a script with a note saying ``You can take
your trashy script back,'' according to Kunhardt).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A not-so-linear look
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To compress 41 presidencies into 10 hours, the Kunhardts devised
an approach that links presidents across decades and even centuries
according to themes their presidencies had in common. ``We all felt
a little bored by the idea of doing it chronologically,'' Kunhardt
explained. ``To start with Washington and walk in lock step through
history would put people to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for instance, the first hour, titled ``Family Ties,'' looks
at four presidents _ Kennedy, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John
Quincy Adams, and Benjamin Harrison _ who were the scions of
privileged families that transferred power from one generation to
the next. The second hour, ``Happenstance,'' examines vice
presidents upon whom the presidency was thrust because of
assassination or natural death: Harry Truman, Andrew Johnson,
Chester Alan Arthur, Millard Fillmore, and John Tyler. ``The Heroic
Posture,'' airing Wednesday night, looks at military heroes who
ascended to the presidency, from George Washington to Ulysses S.
Grant to Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to see if there were patterns, and there were,''
said Sidey. However, he added, ``It would be a serious mistake to
make too much of them.'
</P>
<P>
   The series also tries to cast an unexpected light on presidents
whose images have become calcified over time. For instance, Abraham
Lincoln is often depicted as a figure of near-saintly idealism,
driven by a zeal to stamp out slavery while preserving the union.
But the Kunhardts made the dry-eyed choice to include Lincoln in
the episode titled ``The Professional Politician,'' along with
presidents more commonly associated with backroom maneuvering, such
as Lyndon Baines Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a crafty man, a hugely ambitious man,'' Kunhardt said
of Lincoln. ``He was devoted to party politics, and he worked the
machinery all his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The segment on Kennedy does not conclude, as one might expect,
with his assassination in Dallas, but rather with his
overwhelmingly successful trip to Ireland, where he was hailed as
the first Irish-Catholic president. ``It's so well known, the story
of his shooting and death,'' said Kunhardt. Instead, the
assassination is treated in a later segment on LBJ.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hail to the chief, indeed
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat ironically, perhaps, ``The American President'' (not to
be confused with the Rob Reiner-directed, Aaron Sorkin-scripted
feature film) arrives at a moment when the presidency occupies a
smaller place in American life, at least in Sidey's view.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it is a relatively tranquil era, free of economic
catastrophe and major wars. ``Crisis tends to etch a president in
clear terms,'' said Sidey, who is president of the White House
Historical Association. Moreover, he said, ``This is a time in
which the private sector is driving not just the country, but the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another factor that has shrunken the stature of the
presidency, in Sidey's view, and that is television. He believes
that CNN and other networks have assumed outsize importance in the
conduct of foreign policy, with leaders such as Yassir Arafat and
Moammar Khadafy taking their cues from their TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television just overwhelmed us; the White House is just a
stage now,'' said Sidey. ``It's a power that on many days is
greater than the president's, what echoes through that world.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-year task of immersing themselves in the study of
America's presidents and trying to see them whole led Sidey and
Kunhardt to reappraise some of them. Sidey said that Grant went up
in his estimation (``As a person, anyway; his presidency was a
mess''), and so did Rutherford B. Hayes, who declined to seek an
extra term because he concluded the country didn't need him
anymore. Kunhardt said he now thinks of Jefferson's first term as
one of the greatest ever, and views James Garfield as ``one of the
greatest minds we ever elected.''
</P>
<P>
   A clear theme that emerges from the series is that while some
presidents have been happy warriors in office _ Theodore Roosevelt,
FDR, Reagan _ the presidency was to many others, in Sidey's words,
``a pain in the side.'' Jefferson, for instance, enjoyed his stint
so little that he did not include the fact that he was the nation's
third president on the list of accomplishments he wanted engraved
on his tombstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an onerous job for many of them, if not most,''
Kunhardt observed. ``Almost all of them say something about what a
miserable place (the White House) is, and how they can't wait to
get out.''

 By DERRICK K. BAKER  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Denny's restaurant chain is on my list of offending
businesses found guilty of racial discrimination in 1993, followed
in 1996 by Texaco and in 1999 by the Cracker Barrel restaurant
chain that dots the sides of the nation's highways. Recently, the
Adam's Mark Hotel chain was added to the ignominious file of
companies that will never again benefit from my patronage because
of their mistreatment of people who happen to be black.
 &HT;    The hotel chain settled five lawsuits with the U.S. Department
of Justice that were filed in May 1999, after several black guests
were treated as security risks last year during the Black College
Reunion in Daytona Beach, Fla.
 &HT;    The African-Americans charged that they _ and other black people
_ were instructed to wear special orange wristbands. The white
guests were not. The black guests were charged a nightly minimum of
$250 for the hotel's least expensive rooms. White guests were not.
Black guests had to pay an additional $50 for anyone who visited
their room during the weekend. Visitors of white guests were not
charged a fee.
 &HT;    The corporate folks who run the 21-hotel chain didn't admit to
any wrongdoing, but agreed to pay $4.4 million to guests and
visitors of the resort. The five original plaintiffs will each
receive $25,000. The company also agreed to initiate
nondiscrimination policies and begin efforts to attract more
minority customers as part of the settlement.
 &HT;    Adam's Mark will implement several measures designed to validate
that it provides equal treatment for all guests. A national equal
employment opportunity organization known as Project Equality will
independently oversee the implementation of the terms of the
agreement, which will be in place for four years.
 &HT;    Under the settlement, Adam's Mark will enhance existing
corporate policies and practices to ensure that no guest will be
discriminated. The hotel will also create a diverse secret-shoppers
program to ensure equal treatment of guests.
 &HT;    Discrimination based on race happens everyday and in every way _
especially when you call yourself an African-American, or look like
one. Unlike the blatant actions taken by the Adam's Mark hotel
staff, blacks are often covertly victimized and minimized by racial
discrimination. However, it would be unfair to place every last
employee of an Adam's Mark or Denny's in an unfair light, when a
few perpetrating employees cast a bad light on the entire
corporation.
 &HT;    The elimination of racial discrimination will happen as soon as
every last person on Earth is dead. A brutally harsh analogy, but
true nonetheless. Combating racism _ a pernicious illness _ is the
bane of blacks' existence.
 &HT;    Consequently, it should be ridiculously easy to reject the idea
of patronizing a business of any size that conspicuously displays a
reckless disregard for African-Americans' financial support.
 &HT;    While a Texaco or a Cracker Barrel will never miss the few
dollars I won't spend with them as a result of my personal boycott,
the principle of the matter, and an overwhelming sense of
self-respect and racial pride, remains paramount for people with
similar views.
 &HT;    Any person of color who accepts the corporate equivalent of
having saliva spat into their face must rethink their priorities,
particularly when there are hundreds of other hotels and
restaurants to patronize.
 &HT;    Don't risk patronizing establishments that will disrespect you
to the degree that you risk incarceration because of your inability
to refrain from knocking some offending clerk back into his
mother's womb.
 &HT;    When employees at various local operations of multimillion
dollar companies mistreat customers of color, local management is
responsible for responding to the act, remedying it and
appropriately reprimanding the employee. When that sequence of
events doesn't happen, it's logical to assume that the culture of
the operation condones such behavior, which also makes local
management _ and ultimately the corporate honchos _ culpable for
the mistreatment.
 &HT;    In these lawsuit-happy times, it is logical to expect that when
tip-dependent waitresses, minimum-wage cashiers at family
restaurants, or the front desk staff at a luxury hotel overcharge
black customers and hold them to different and higher standards,
corporate management should anticipate a lawsuit, which probably
means shelling out money for its defense, and to settling a
class-action lawsuit.
 &HT;    The outcome of the Adam Mark's case once again proves that
biased actions based on racial discrimination and corporate
indifference is extremely costly, and not only for mistreated
customers who happen to have been born black.

 By ENKHSAIKHAN JARGALSAIKHANY  
 &HT;    Chinese civilization rests on the formidable shoulders of the
great Confucius. Macedonians revere Alexander the Great as a hero
and a cultural icon. For Mongolians, Genghis Khan occupies the same
rarefied stratum of history. He is seen as a leader and sage, whose
achievements revolutionized Mongolian society. Yet to most
residents of the West, the perception of Genghis Khan remains that
of a barbarian _ the quintessential cartoon savage.
 &HT;    Centuries of interaction have opened the doorway to
communication between East and West, leading to new understandings
of the cultures and histories of countries like China, Japan and
India. Unfortunately, this progress toward enlightenment is far
from universal.
 &HT;    Mongolian Americans feel it is time that misconceptions about
our culture are addressed _ and dismissed. No better time exists
than now, the cusp of the new millennium, with 2001 proclaimed by
the United Nations General Assembly as the ``Year of Dialogue Among
Civilizations.''
 &HT;    But the first step in understanding Mongolia, before even
arriving at a point where educated questions may be asked, is to
come to the realization that for Mongolians, Genghis Khan was more
than a warrior and conqueror. He was a teacher honored for his
wisdom, and the founder of the Mongolian nation.
 &HT;    Like Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan extended his empire by
conquest. Unlike Alexander's, Genghis Khan's empire did not
fragment after his death. In fact, due to the administrative skills
and judicious rule of Genghis Khan and his descendants, it became
the largest land-empire in recorded world history.
 &HT;    Still, few people in America would utter the phrase ``Genghis
the Great,'' except perhaps in jest. It's almost as if it is a
dangerous notion for Westerners to find a heroic ideal like that of
Alexander in an Asian man, Genghis Khan.
 &HT;    I'm not denying that there is a darker side to the Khan, as
there has been to world leaders from Mao to Napoleon to Roosevelt.
Without a doubt, the building of the Mongolian empire came through
bloodshed and destruction. Yet it is recognized by historians that,
at the golden peak of the empire, the Mongols reopened the Silk
Road, allowing for a flood of contact, exchange and diplomacy
between East and West.
 &HT;    The Mongol court provided special privileges for artists and
craftsmen, giving them tax exempt status. The patronage of the
Mongol courts in China, Iran and Central Asia led to an
unparalleled period of cultural synthesis and flowering of the
arts. The court also maintained strict laws of religious tolerance
for all. These and other positive aspects of Mongol rule are
inconvenient realities to those for whom a reevaluation of the
Mongols would require a reassessment of the role of Asia and nomads
in world history.
 &HT;    Genghis Khan was the founder of the Mongolian nation, and its
chief lawgiver and judge. His decrees, compiled into a system of
laws called the Yasa, became the basis for governance throughout
the Mongol empire, and extended beyond the empire to neighboring
lands, where they remained a part of common law until the 19th
century. The edicts of the Yasa promoted tolerance, group
consensus, women's rights and the safe- guarding of landscape and
wildlife _ the first codified environmental protection laws of
their kind.
 &HT;    It is often said that ``history is written by the victors'' _
not in this case. The history of Genghis Khan and the Mongols was
written by non-Mongolian chroniclers who were subjects of the
empire. It was through their subjective lens that perceptions of
the Mongols were disseminated in the Middle Ages, and their
viewpoint has persisted until today.
 &HT;    Since these historians were conquered peoples, it is not
surprising that the positive aspects of Mongolia's contributions
proved to be less prominent in their accounts than the terrible
stereotypes.
 &HT;    The tarnishing of our nation's image has experienced little
reprieve over the centuries. Genghis Khan's one big moment in the
Hollywood spotlight was an absurd and offensive portrayal by John
Wayne _ of all people. It did little to lift the great man's
memory.
 &HT;    But time heals most wounds, and a new sense of global
consciousness is emerging. Mongolians in America are hopeful that,
in the age to come, a more accurate and sensitive understanding of
our culture, our role in world history and our most prominent
historical figure, might someday be achieved.

U.S. JUDICIAL SYSTEM RIFE WITH RACISM, FEDERAL JUDGE CHARGES

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Just as racial profiling by this nation's law-enforcement
officers is finally being exposed, evidence of racial
discrimination throughout America's federal and state judicial
systems can no longer be ignored, according to a veteran New York
federal judge.
 &HT;    Federal Judge Robert L. Carter, senior judge of the Southern
District Court of New York, pulled no punches when he spoke before
the New York County Lawyers' Association at the fourth annual
Haywood Burns Memorial Lecture, which took place in May. He charged
that racial discrimination is so widespread in America's criminal
justice system that its correction is as crucial as providing equal
educational opportunity for inner-city children.
 &HT;    Carter said that throughout his career as a lawyer and judge he
had been concerned chiefly with racial inequality in education;
however, recent research has forced him to conclude that ``at every
level and in every phase of the various systems, racism is at
play.''
 &HT;    Strong language for a senior federal judge who has spent 28
years on the federal bench.
 &HT;    Carter finds it appalling that reports from the Department of
Justice show that of the 1.8 million people in local, state and
federal prisons, 900,000 _ or 50 percent _ are black. Blacks make
up between 12 percent and 13 percent of the nation's total
population.
 &HT;    He said it was sad for the whole nation when, in 1993, America
had from ``five to 10 times'' the number of people incarcerated
than other Western nations. The racial data makes the scenario
worse, he said. In 1993, America imprisoned blacks at a rate 20
times the rate that Europeans jailed their citizens. He noted that
in 1996 the Department of Justice reported that one in three black
males between the ages of 20 and 29 were involved with the justice
and prison systems.
 &HT;    If this trend continues, one in four black male babies born
today will spend at least a year in jail. Predictions for white
male babies is one in 23, he said.
 &HT;    Carter said that according to research he reviewed, the number
of black women and teen-agers who are incarcerated reflects the
judicial system's overall biased approach to criminal justice. From
1985 to 1995, the number of black women prisoners increased by 204
percent _ eight times the rate of white women, he said. Meanwhile,
black juveniles, who comprise 15 percent of the nation's youth
population, make up 32 percent of those arrested on drug charges,
and 63 percent of those cases have been moved up to adult criminal
courts.
 &HT;    Does this mean that black criminality outrageously surpasses
that of other races? No. The outrage lies in the court system's
mistreatment of blacks. According to the Department of Health and
Human Services, in 1998 blacks comprised only 15 percent of
America's drug users. However, they made up 37 percent of those
arrested and 53 percent of state court convictions.
 &HT;    If blacks made up only 15 percent of our drug users, Carter
asked, how was it that nationwide 66,000 were arrested as opposed
to 15,000 whites? And why, between 1990 and 1994, were 75 percent
of all juveniles arrested for drugs black while only 25 percent
were white?
 &HT;    Members of Congress were astounded when in 1995 the Sentencing
Commission exposed the fact that 52 percent of crack users were
white in contrast to 38 percent who were black. Yet, blacks
represented 90 percent of the total number of people convicted for
offenses involving crack.
 &HT;    Something is wrong somewhere. Carter noted that Congress itself
made it possible for a person caught carrying 5 grams of crack
cocaine to receive a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in
jail. But a person whose drug of choice is powdered cocaine must be
caught with 500 grams of the stuff to handed the same sentence.
Incidentally, powdered cocaine is presumed to be a favorite of
whites.
 &HT;    Carter then turned to Marc Mauer's study, ``Race to
Incarcerate,'' to show how in 1990 white men represented 78 percent
of the total arrests for drunk driving, which killed 22,000 each
year. He compared those 22,000 casualties with the 21,000 deaths
caused by AIDS from unclean needles, drug overdoses and slayings
associated with drug sales.
 &HT;    Carter then pointed to the drunk drivers who are given
misdemeanor sentences and are required to perform community service
or pay a fine.
 &HT;    Makes you think.
 &HT;    Carter also pointed to statistics from the NAACP-Legal Defense
Fund's 1999 report which showed that 43 percent of those on death
row are black. While only 50 percent of homicide victims are white,
84 percent of those sentenced to death are convicted of killing
whites.
 &HT;    Carter's final shocker: He fears that ``774,000 low-skilled
blacks'' will soon be leaving prison and flooding the labor market
_ unlikely candidates for either employment or absorption into
their communities. And they will be denied the right to vote
because they have become disenfranchised ex-cons.
 &HT;    Much food for thought.

 &HT;    Long before the first primary election, I wrote an article about
the presidential candidates and their chances of advancing to the
November elections. My predictions came true.
 &HT;    Of course, I evaluated the candidates through my Native-American
eyes. At first I wrote that of all the candidates, Bill Bradley
would be the best president for Indians and John McCain a close
second. George W. Bush would be a tragedy.
 &HT;    As the incumbent vice president, Al Gore was a part of an
administration that made efforts to address many of the problems in
Indian country.
 &HT;    But, after taking a more pragmatic look at the candidates, I
concluded that the status quo would prevail and that George W. Bush
and Al Gore would move on to the November elections.
 &HT;    Several wealthy Indians from the Pequot Nation in Connecticut
jumped on the John McCain bandwagon a bit late. They contributed
$20,000 to his campaign a couple of days before Terrible Tuesday.
They probably wished they had put it on the roulette table at their
Foxwood Casino because McCain went down in flames on Super Tuesday.
 &HT;    Up in the state of Washington, the Indian nations are out to
nail Sen. Slade Gorton's hide to the wall. Gorton (R-Wash.) has
attempted to introduce legislation that flies in the face of Indian
law, Indian treaties and federal law. Like George W. Bush, he
believes that state governments should have total jurisdiction over
Indian tribes. Of course, Slade is very popular with the general
population (read: white) of Washington, and they do have the
numbers to keep him in office.
 &HT;    Only in recent years have Indians become interested and involved
in national politics. For too long they just assumed that they did
not have the clout to impact federal elections. But, with the
advent of casinos and bingo halls, the tribes suddenly found
themselves with a little extra cash that they could invest into
politics _ so much so that when the gaming compacts were written
for the Indian tribes of New Mexico, one stipulation was that the
tribes do not use any gaming revenues for political contributions.
 &HT;    Can you imagine any state government telling a business (and a
casino is a business) how they can or cannot spend their profits?
What unmitigated gall.
 &HT;    Why are the elected officials of New Mexico so afraid of the
Indian tribes and pueblos spending their money to influence
elections? Non-Indians have been doing it for years, and while they
forbid the Indian nations from doing it, they continue to do it
themselves. What hypocrisy!
 &HT;    The Indian vote doesn't mean much in states with small Indian
populations. For instance, the Indian vote in New York State won't
change a candidate's chances one way or the other. However, in
Arizona, New Mexico, South Dakota and other states with large
Indian populations, the Indian vote can be pivotal.
 &HT;    In the past, it was hard to convince Indian voters that the
person who is elected can greatly influence their lives. Laws are
made by Congress, and Congress can (and has) taken land, minerals
and natural resources from the Indian nations with a stroke of the
pen. Schools, hospitals and law enforcement have been helped or
hindered by acts of Congress.
 &HT;    For many years, Indians generally ignored national and state
elections and concentrated on their own tribal elections. As the
Indian media gained a voice in Indian country and more information
became available to the voters of the Indian reservations, this all
began to change.
 &HT;    I believe Gore will be the candidate of choice for 99 percent of
Indian voters. He has had the opportunity to serve in an
administration that reached out to the American Indian and created
programs that would bring jobs and better schools to the
reservations. That's a major plus.
 &HT;    Sometimes the further one is away from the Beltway the better
vision they develop. Out in Indian country, we have a pretty clear
view. Looks like Al Gore in 2000.

 By DERRICK K. BAKER  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Denny's restaurant chain is on my list of offending
businesses found guilty of racial discrimination in 1993, followed
in 1996 by Texaco and in 1999 by the Cracker Barrel restaurant
chain that dots the sides of the nation's highways. Recently, the
Adam's Mark Hotel chain was added to the ignominious file of
companies that will never again benefit from my patronage because
of their mistreatment of people who happen to be black.
 &HT;    The hotel chain settled five lawsuits with the U.S. Department
of Justice that were filed in May 1999, after several black guests
were treated as security risks last year during the Black College
Reunion in Daytona Beach, Fla.
 &HT;    The African-Americans charged that they _ and other black people
_ were instructed to wear special orange wristbands. The white
guests were not. The black guests were charged a nightly minimum of
$250 for the hotel's least expensive rooms. White guests were not.
Black guests had to pay an additional $50 for anyone who visited
their room during the weekend. Visitors of white guests were not
charged a fee.
 &HT;    The corporate folks who run the 21-hotel chain didn't admit to
any wrongdoing, but agreed to pay $4.4 million to guests and
visitors of the resort. The five original plaintiffs will each
receive $25,000. The company also agreed to initiate
nondiscrimination policies and begin efforts to attract more
minority customers as part of the settlement.
 &HT;    Adam's Mark will implement several measures designed to validate
that it provides equal treatment for all guests. A national equal
employment opportunity organization known as Project Equality will
independently oversee the implementation of the terms of the
agreement, which will be in place for four years.
 &HT;    Under the settlement, Adam's Mark will enhance existing
corporate policies and practices to ensure that no guest will be
discriminated. The hotel will also create a diverse secret-shoppers
program to ensure equal treatment of guests.
 &HT;    Discrimination based on race happens everyday and in every way _
especially when you call yourself an African-American, or look like
one. Unlike the blatant actions taken by the Adam's Mark hotel
staff, blacks are often covertly victimized and minimized by racial
discrimination. However, it would be unfair to place every last
employee of an Adam's Mark or Denny's in an unfair light, when a
few perpetrating employees cast a bad light on the entire
corporation.
 &HT;    The elimination of racial discrimination will happen as soon as
every last person on Earth is dead. A brutally harsh analogy, but
true nonetheless. Combating racism _ a pernicious illness _ is the
bane of blacks' existence.
 &HT;    Consequently, it should be ridiculously easy to reject the idea
of patronizing a business of any size that conspicuously displays a
reckless disregard for African-Americans' financial support.
 &HT;    While a Texaco or a Cracker Barrel will never miss the few
dollars I won't spend with them as a result of my personal boycott,
the principle of the matter, and an overwhelming sense of
self-respect and racial pride, remains paramount for people with
similar views.
 &HT;    Any person of color who accepts the corporate equivalent of
having saliva spat into their face must rethink their priorities,
particularly when there are hundreds of other hotels and
restaurants to patronize.
 &HT;    Don't risk patronizing establishments that will disrespect you
to the degree that you risk incarceration because of your inability
to refrain from knocking some offending clerk back into his
mother's womb.
 &HT;    When employees at various local operations of multimillion
dollar companies mistreat customers of color, local management is
responsible for responding to the act, remedying it and
appropriately reprimanding the employee. When that sequence of
events doesn't happen, it's logical to assume that the culture of
the operation condones such behavior, which also makes local
management _ and ultimately the corporate honchos _ culpable for
the mistreatment.
 &HT;    In these lawsuit-happy times, it is logical to expect that when
tip-dependent waitresses, minimum-wage cashiers at family
restaurants, or the front desk staff at a luxury hotel overcharge
black customers and hold them to different and higher standards,
corporate management should anticipate a lawsuit, which probably
means shelling out money for its defense, and to settling a
class-action lawsuit.
 &HT;    The outcome of the Adam Mark's case once again proves that
biased actions based on racial discrimination and corporate
indifference is extremely costly, and not only for mistreated
customers who happen to have been born black.

 By ENKHSAIKHAN JARGALSAIKHANY  
 &HT;    Chinese civilization rests on the formidable shoulders of the
great Confucius. Macedonians revere Alexander the Great as a hero
and a cultural icon. For Mongolians, Genghis Khan occupies the same
rarefied stratum of history. He is seen as a leader and sage, whose
achievements revolutionized Mongolian society. Yet to most
residents of the West, the perception of Genghis Khan remains that
of a barbarian _ the quintessential cartoon savage.
 &HT;    Centuries of interaction have opened the doorway to
communication between East and West, leading to new understandings
of the cultures and histories of countries like China, Japan and
India. Unfortunately, this progress toward enlightenment is far
from universal.
 &HT;    Mongolian Americans feel it is time that misconceptions about
our culture are addressed _ and dismissed. No better time exists
than now, the cusp of the new millennium, with 2001 proclaimed by
the United Nations General Assembly as the ``Year of Dialogue Among
Civilizations.''
 &HT;    But the first step in understanding Mongolia, before even
arriving at a point where educated questions may be asked, is to
come to the realization that for Mongolians, Genghis Khan was more
than a warrior and conqueror. He was a teacher honored for his
wisdom, and the founder of the Mongolian nation.
 &HT;    Like Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan extended his empire by
conquest. Unlike Alexander's, Genghis Khan's empire did not
fragment after his death. In fact, due to the administrative skills
and judicious rule of Genghis Khan and his descendants, it became
the largest land-empire in recorded world history.
 &HT;    Still, few people in America would utter the phrase ``Genghis
the Great,'' except perhaps in jest. It's almost as if it is a
dangerous notion for Westerners to find a heroic ideal like that of
Alexander in an Asian man, Genghis Khan.
 &HT;    I'm not denying that there is a darker side to the Khan, as
there has been to world leaders from Mao to Napoleon to Roosevelt.
Without a doubt, the building of the Mongolian empire came through
bloodshed and destruction. Yet it is recognized by historians that,
at the golden peak of the empire, the Mongols reopened the Silk
Road, allowing for a flood of contact, exchange and diplomacy
between East and West.
 &HT;    The Mongol court provided special privileges for artists and
craftsmen, giving them tax exempt status. The patronage of the
Mongol courts in China, Iran and Central Asia led to an
unparalleled period of cultural synthesis and flowering of the
arts. The court also maintained strict laws of religious tolerance
for all. These and other positive aspects of Mongol rule are
inconvenient realities to those for whom a reevaluation of the
Mongols would require a reassessment of the role of Asia and nomads
in world history.
 &HT;    Genghis Khan was the founder of the Mongolian nation, and its
chief lawgiver and judge. His decrees, compiled into a system of
laws called the Yasa, became the basis for governance throughout
the Mongol empire, and extended beyond the empire to neighboring
lands, where they remained a part of common law until the 19th
century. The edicts of the Yasa promoted tolerance, group
consensus, women's rights and the safe- guarding of landscape and
wildlife _ the first codified environmental protection laws of
their kind.
 &HT;    It is often said that ``history is written by the victors'' _
not in this case. The history of Genghis Khan and the Mongols was
written by non-Mongolian chroniclers who were subjects of the
empire. It was through their subjective lens that perceptions of
the Mongols were disseminated in the Middle Ages, and their
viewpoint has persisted until today.
 &HT;    Since these historians were conquered peoples, it is not
surprising that the positive aspects of Mongolia's contributions
proved to be less prominent in their accounts than the terrible
stereotypes.
 &HT;    The tarnishing of our nation's image has experienced little
reprieve over the centuries. Genghis Khan's one big moment in the
Hollywood spotlight was an absurd and offensive portrayal by John
Wayne _ of all people. It did little to lift the great man's
memory.
 &HT;    But time heals most wounds, and a new sense of global
consciousness is emerging. Mongolians in America are hopeful that,
in the age to come, a more accurate and sensitive understanding of
our culture, our role in world history and our most prominent
historical figure, might someday be achieved.

U.S. JUDICIAL SYSTEM RIFE WITH RACISM, FEDERAL JUDGE CHARGES

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Just as racial profiling by this nation's law-enforcement
officers is finally being exposed, evidence of racial
discrimination throughout America's federal and state judicial
systems can no longer be ignored, according to a veteran New York
federal judge.
 &HT;    Federal Judge Robert L. Carter, senior judge of the Southern
District Court of New York, pulled no punches when he spoke before
the New York County Lawyers' Association at the fourth annual
Haywood Burns Memorial Lecture, which took place in May. He charged
that racial discrimination is so widespread in America's criminal
justice system that its correction is as crucial as providing equal
educational opportunity for inner-city children.
 &HT;    Carter said that throughout his career as a lawyer and judge he
had been concerned chiefly with racial inequality in education;
however, recent research has forced him to conclude that ``at every
level and in every phase of the various systems, racism is at
play.''
 &HT;    Strong language for a senior federal judge who has spent 28
years on the federal bench.
 &HT;    Carter finds it appalling that reports from the Department of
Justice show that of the 1.8 million people in local, state and
federal prisons, 900,000 _ or 50 percent _ are black. Blacks make
up between 12 percent and 13 percent of the nation's total
population.
 &HT;    He said it was sad for the whole nation when, in 1993, America
had from ``five to 10 times'' the number of people incarcerated
than other Western nations. The racial data makes the scenario
worse, he said. In 1993, America imprisoned blacks at a rate 20
times the rate that Europeans jailed their citizens. He noted that
in 1996 the Department of Justice reported that one in three black
males between the ages of 20 and 29 were involved with the justice
and prison systems.
 &HT;    If this trend continues, one in four black male babies born
today will spend at least a year in jail. Predictions for white
male babies is one in 23, he said.
 &HT;    Carter said that according to research he reviewed, the number
of black women and teen-agers who are incarcerated reflects the
judicial system's overall biased approach to criminal justice. From
1985 to 1995, the number of black women prisoners increased by 204
percent _ eight times the rate of white women, he said. Meanwhile,
black juveniles, who comprise 15 percent of the nation's youth
population, make up 32 percent of those arrested on drug charges,
and 63 percent of those cases have been moved up to adult criminal
courts.
 &HT;    Does this mean that black criminality outrageously surpasses
that of other races? No. The outrage lies in the court system's
mistreatment of blacks. According to the Department of Health and
Human Services, in 1998 blacks comprised only 15 percent of
America's drug users. However, they made up 37 percent of those
arrested and 53 percent of state court convictions.
 &HT;    If blacks made up only 15 percent of our drug users, Carter
asked, how was it that nationwide 66,000 were arrested as opposed
to 15,000 whites? And why, between 1990 and 1994, were 75 percent
of all juveniles arrested for drugs black while only 25 percent
were white?
 &HT;    Members of Congress were astounded when in 1995 the Sentencing
Commission exposed the fact that 52 percent of crack users were
white in contrast to 38 percent who were black. Yet, blacks
represented 90 percent of the total number of people convicted for
offenses involving crack.
 &HT;    Something is wrong somewhere. Carter noted that Congress itself
made it possible for a person caught carrying 5 grams of crack
cocaine to receive a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in
jail. But a person whose drug of choice is powdered cocaine must be
caught with 500 grams of the stuff to handed the same sentence.
Incidentally, powdered cocaine is presumed to be a favorite of
whites.
 &HT;    Carter then turned to Marc Mauer's study, ``Race to
Incarcerate,'' to show how in 1990 white men represented 78 percent
of the total arrests for drunk driving, which killed 22,000 each
year. He compared those 22,000 casualties with the 21,000 deaths
caused by AIDS from unclean needles, drug overdoses and slayings
associated with drug sales.
 &HT;    Carter then pointed to the drunk drivers who are given
misdemeanor sentences and are required to perform community service
or pay a fine.
 &HT;    Makes you think.
 &HT;    Carter also pointed to statistics from the NAACP-Legal Defense
Fund's 1999 report which showed that 43 percent of those on death
row are black. While only 50 percent of homicide victims are white,
84 percent of those sentenced to death are convicted of killing
whites.
 &HT;    Carter's final shocker: He fears that ``774,000 low-skilled
blacks'' will soon be leaving prison and flooding the labor market
_ unlikely candidates for either employment or absorption into
their communities. And they will be denied the right to vote
because they have become disenfranchised ex-cons.
 &HT;    Much food for thought.

What unmitigated gall.
 &HT;    Why are the elected officials of New Mexico so afraid of the
Indian tribes and pueblos spending their money to influence
elections? Non-Indians have been doing it for years, and while they
forbid the Indian nations from doing it, they continue to do it
themselves. What hypocrisy!
 &HT;    The Indian vote doesn't mean much in states with small Indian
populations. For instance, the Indian vote in New York State won't
change a candidate's chances one way or the other. However, in
Arizona, New Mexico, South Dakota and other states with large
Indian populations, the Indian vote can be pivotal.
 &HT;    In the past, it was hard to convince Indian voters that the
person who is elected can greatly influence their lives. Laws are
made by Congress, and Congress can (and has) taken land, minerals
and natural resources from the Indian nations with a stroke of the
pen. Schools, hospitals and law enforcement have been helped or
hindered by acts of Congress.
 &HT;    For many years, Indians generally ignored national and state
elections and concentrated on their own tribal elections. As the
Indian media gained a voice in Indian country and more information
became available to the voters of the Indian reservations, this all
began to change.
 &HT;    I believe Gore will be the candidate of choice for 99 percent of
Indian voters. He has had the opportunity to serve in an
administration that reached out to the American Indian and created
programs that would bring jobs and better schools to the
reservations. That's a major plus.
 &HT;    Sometimes the further one is away from the Beltway the better
vision they develop. Out in Indian country, we have a pretty clear
view. Looks like Al Gore in 2000.

THE BATTLE FOR THE AMERICAN MUSICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fight for the soul of the American musical
continues unabated. At one extreme are corporate merchants, such as
Disney, with their musical cartoons, and at the other are the
artistes, with their pseudo-operatic attempts to reinvent Broadway
in the likeness of their patron saint, Stephen Sondheim. Those in
the latter camp have found a radiant spokeswoman for their cause in
singer Audra McDonald, but the list of their Broadway failures just
gets longer _ Jason Robert Brown's ``Parade,'' Michael John
LaChiusa's ``Marie Christine,'' and Andrew Lippa's ``The Wild
Party.'' Meanwhile, the awfulness of the new Elton John-Tim Rice
``Aida'' makes you want to shout, ``Come back to Broadway, Paul
Simon _ all is forgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   All is not lost, though. Musical jewels do emerge, such as
``Ragtime'' and Julie Taymor's contribution to ``The Lion King''
from a couple of years ago. There are a couple of bright,MUSICALS,
Page F6 &QL; 
shining nonrevivals on Broadway this year, too, though they aren't
traditional musicals at all _ ``Contact'' and ``James Joyce's The
Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, traditional musicals in the sense that they
possess the same virtues that the great musicals have, from ``Show
Boat'' onward _ sharp writing; a seamless mixture of song, dance,
and story; witty lyrics; and a sense of whimsy or romance that
leads to a heightened reality. Source material really has nothing
to do with it. ``Anna and the King of Siam'' was not a literary
masterpiece, but ``The King and I'' is a great musical. Verdi's
``Aida'' is one of the world's great operas; the musical based on
it is one of Broadway's biggest duds.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what unites trivial pursuits such as ``Aida'' and
Andrew Lloyd Webber's upcoming ``Whistle Down the Wind'' on the one
hand and artistic pretensions like ``Parade'' and Simon's
``Capeman'' on the other is a lugubrious sensibility. They're
operatic in intent, but pop-eratic in delivery, peddling phony
transcendence in the case of Sirs Elton and Andrew and bleak chic
from the sons of Sondheim.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to denigrate Sondheim, who reportedly is no fan of
operatic pretensions such as recitativ narrative and who is perhaps
the last great lyricist of musical theater. But ``Sweeney Todd,''
``Company,'' ``A Little Night Music,'' and even ``Passion'' are not
operas, or evenpoperas, they are full-blooded musicals in every
sense, picking up where he left off with the lyrics to ``West Side
Story.'' He is still charting his own serious course. It's the less
talented trying to sail behind him who have landed the musical on
the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contact'' and ``The Dead'' have seemingly little in common
with Sondheim's musicals _ neither has a real score, for one thing
_ but there are some similarities worth considering. First and
foremost is their uniqueness. ``Contact'' creates a world totally
its own, somewhere in between modern dance and musical theater,
with its three tableaux of relationships, from the 18th century to
the present. ``The Dead'' takes the Joyce story from which John
Huston made his last film and follows the musical cues to create
its own rich universe, warmer than Joyce's but no less bound to
mortality, with Shaun Davey's mixture of traditional Irish songs,
operatic excerpts, and his own ballads.
</P>
<P>
   Both have recently moved from off-Broadway theaters to larger
Tony-eligible theaters because of huge demand, proving there is a
market for new musicals that have their wits and their tunes
together. ``Contact'' doesn't have any new music of its own, and
yet the spirit-soaring feeling one gets watching it is certainly
akin to that of seeing a great musical like ``Company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Contact'' is the brainchild of choreographer Susan Stroman and
Sondheim collaborator John Weidman. It follows romantic
relationships from 1767, when three characters swing their way
through a Lady Chatterley-like menage a trois, through a scene of
1950s sexism to the current times, with dancing that makes the jaw
drop and melodies that make the toes tap, with a superb combination
of prerecorded classical, jazz, and rock music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contact'' is what ``Fosse'' would have been had it not set its
sights so low. The three stories share a lush sensuality, from an
18th-century peek of thigh to the more bared and buffed sexual
dancing of today. The triptych opens with the 18th-century lovers _
a young woman on a swing being pushed by her servant while being
wooed by someone of her own class. First one and then the other
will join her on her perch and give new meaning to the term
swinging singles, all to the tunes of Stephane Grapelli.
</P>
<P>
   Part 2 continues the whimsy with shades of Richie Aprile and
Janice from ``The Sopranos'': Karen Ziemba plays a woman who is
literally taken out to eat at an Italian restaurant by her Mafioso
husband, who orders her not to move, smile, or even look at anyone
while he goes to the buffet. But whenever he leaves, her fantasies
take over and she dances up a storm (to Tchaikovsky, Bizet, and
Grieg) with the waiters and other diners. How is this different
from modern dance? It's Ziemba's acting, which recalls Giulietta
Masina's touching persona in ``La Strada,'' as much as her
crotch-in-face dancing that makes this scene and sets the
post-intermission stage for the finale.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``All That Twilight Company''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's in this tableau where ``Company'' meets ``All That Jazz''
and even ``The Twilight Zone.'' Boyd Gaines, a Tony winner who
starred in ``Company'' and ``Cabaret,'' plays an alcoholic ad
executive who comes home from picking up an award to his soulless,
modern Manhattan apartment where, after numerous comically
choreographed attempts at suicide, he decides to join his
colleagues at a pool hall that becomes a swing-dance club, playing
everything from Dion to Benny Goodman at night. He keeps trying to
make it with one of the beautiful danceaholics _ a woman in yellow
_ while the audience wonders if he'll ever get past his dreary
reality and make real contact with her or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Stroman's direction and choreography are inspired throughout,
but it's in this scene where we, like the ad agency executive, can
see other possibilities in musical theater. Thomas Lynch's set
design, which turns the apartment into a dance hall and back again,
is a tour de force in and of itself, but it's Stroman _ whose
credits include the latest revivals of ``Oklahoma!'' and ``Show
Boat'' _ who shows what can happen when the imagination takes over
and fantasy creates new, glistening realities. That's what musical
theater has always been about and Stroman and friends prove it's an
ideal still worth pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   It comes along at just the right time, considering what a
depressing tourist trap Elton John and Disney have made of
``Aida.'' It obviously has some resonance with those who think the
musical world begins with John and ends with 'N Sync. This is
another attempt to get rock writers to write for Broadway in hopes
of luring younger audiences to theater, but there's no excuse for
the condescension and utter stupidity of ``Aida,'' particularly
after Taymor proved with ``The Lion King'' that you don't have to
dumb down.
</P>
<P>
   Disney got good people here as well _ Robert Falls (``Death of a
Salesman'') directed and cowrote the book with David Henry Hwang
(``M. Butterfly''), and Bob Crowley (``Carousel'') did the set and
costume design. They're not the problem. There's nothing wrong with
scrapping Verdi, but when your musical sights don't transcend
Andrew Lloyd Webber (Tim Rice wrote this book, as well as many of
ALW's) and you're not even trained in that limited genre, the
result is bound to be as insipid as ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   Can you feel the love tonight? Not if you've ever heard the real
thing _ and as Stroman shows, the real thing can be the Beach Boys
as well as Verdi. Young people will flock to ``Aida,'' but the hope
for the future is with ``Contact'' and ``The Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``Contact'' is at Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater, ``James
Joyce's The Dead'' at the Belasco Theatre, and ``Aida'' at the
Palace Theatre in open-ended runs.

appears to be either winding down or coming to to a head, the
little boy's Miami family is expected to meet with
government-appointed child psychologists about how best to transfer
Elian to his father's custody. The Miami family, their backs
clearly to the wall with Attorney General Janet Reno remaining
steadfast in her insistence that they turn over the boy, are
expected to appeal to Florida state family court for relief from
federal pressure. The Miami exile community, meanwhile, continues
its vigil outside the family's Little Havana home to prevent Elian
being taken by federal immigration officials. Developing.

COURT DRAMA TAKES PLACE IN A CHANGING NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be you could rely on certain things in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Live Free or Die. Income tax as ultimate taboo. Conservatism
with a quirky, libertarian streak. The Union-Leader of Manchester's
staunch opposition to all things _ and persons _ Democrat and
liberal. The New Hampshire Supreme Court, a bastion of traditional
values upheld by a strong core of Republican appointees.
</P>
<P>
   But that New Hampshire is passing. And if anyone needed evidence
of that, they need look no further than the recent turmoil swirling
through the halls of the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Anywhere else, the resignation of Justice W. Stephen Thayer III,
demands that Chief Justice David A. Brock be fired, and the
attorney general's scathing report alleging that judges routinely
had inappropriate involvement in cases from which they'd recused
themselves, would be remarkable, perhaps even unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   But in New Hampshire, local observers say, the impact is
seismic. The court's current crisis exposes a state at a turning
point, caught between the traditional _ the small-town, old-boy way
of doing things _ and the new New Hampshire, a high-tech haven
where talk of an income tax is no longer political suicide.
</P>
<P>
   And presiding over it all is Governor Jeanne Shaheen, a
transitional figure if ever there was one: a Democratic woman, the
state's first female governor, who took the no-income-tax pledge,
earning the admiration of none other than the Union-Leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of fundamental institutional pieces in terms of policy
and philosophy are probably being irreparably and irretrievably
changed,'' said Tom Rath, a former state attorney general and a
Republican political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Two candidates for governor this year _ one a Democrat, one a
Republican _ have refused to take the no-income tax pledge. The
Democratic challenger boldly promises to introduce an income tax,
and manages to remain a serious contender.
</P>
<P>
   Life under Concord's golden dome is hardly what it once was. A
Democratic governor is a rare thing in the Granite State. There
have been just four since 1900, which is why so many appointments
to the bench in the past have been Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But now there are as many Democrats as Republicans in the state
Senate. And there are more Democrats in the House of
Representatives than there have been in almost 20 years. The three
senior office-holders in the state _ the governor, the speaker of
the House, and the Senate president _ are all women. Soon, the
Supreme Court might have its first woman. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely alliances form &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In such a shifting climate, unlikely alliances among former foes
have produced dramatic shifts on key issues. This year, the House
approved bills to abolish the death penalty and legalize hemp
farming, and last year it voted for a bill to introduce an income
tax for the first time in state history.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved bills to make gun owners responsible for
keeping weapons away from children and endorsed longer methadone
treatment programs for heroin addicts. None of those votes made it
into law, but support for them was unprecedented in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, much of the change is being driven by some of the
state's newest residents, those who fled across the border from
Massachusetts dreaming of tax-free, small-town life, but trailing
big-city notions of the way government should work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the new people keep saying, `We've come so we can go
back to the old ways,' '' said Representative Alf E. Jacobson of
New London, former president of the New Hampshire Senate.
``Avoiding taxation and avoiding the big city and all that. But
many of them bring their own philosophies with them so that changes
occur as a result of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson himself has tried to change one of the state's most
enduring traits _ its citizen government. One of the smallest
states in the union, New Hampshire has a Legislature that is one of
the biggest, providing one lawmaker for every 2,500 residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say you could cut it in half without a problem,'' he said.
His bill to do so got only 33 votes, however. ``There's a mythology
to some degree about it being a citizen legislature and, therefore,
more democratic than a professional legislature such as
Massachusetts or New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson also proposed legislation in 1998 challenging the right
of the Supreme Court to devise its own rules. Though that bill
failed, too, he thinks it could pass now.
</P>
<P>
   While economics and demographics have driven much of the change
in New Hampshire, the institution that sparked the protracted
debate over the most contentious change _ a statewide income tax _
is the hidebound Supreme Court itself.
</P>
<P>
   Its 1997 decision struck down the system of funding local
schools solely through municipal property taxes, a practice that it
said penalized students in poor communities. As a result, the state
has scrambled to come up with alternatives for sharing the wealth
of richer towns with poorer ones. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Judges face criticism &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling unleashed the controversy over taxes that has
gripped the state for the past several years, and made some
legislators and residents intensely critical of the judges who sit
in the courtroom with the roaring fire overlooking the Merrimack
River.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the (Supreme Court) judges' decision that has really
opened this whole discussion,'' Rath said. ``There's an irony to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the Supreme Court controversy, Shaheen last
week appointed a nonpartisan, former Dartmouth president, David
McLaughlin, to the blue-ribbon commission that will study the
state's tax structure. And, in another sign of the shifting times,
her failure to appoint a strong opponent of income taxes has
elicited no outrage from a public that still takes fierce pride in
living in the last state in the union without a broad-based tax _
either sales or income.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me that was the big surprise last week,'' said Jere R.
Daniell, a Dartmouth College history professor. ``By depoliticizing
the panel, she has bought herself some time. It will certainly
allow for a thorough study, and it could open up the possibility of
a broad income tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of the school funding decision, some legislators,
and the Union-Leader, could spare no sympathy for Thayer and Brock
last week. Publisher Joseph W. McQuaid signed a front-page
editorial pillorying the justices after news broke that Thayer had
allegedly tried to influence his own divorce appeal and another
case in which he had an interest, and that Brock listened to him.
</P>
<P>
   McQuaid demanded that Shaheen remove four of the five Supreme
Court judges. True, McQuaid suggested that Shaheen's new
appointments be only temporary, but the fact that a prominent
conservative was advocating that a Democratic governor name a slate
of new judges was a sure sign that something significant was
happening in the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Thayer, coupled with the possible ouster of
Brock and the upcoming retirement of Judge Sherman Horton, could
allow Shaheen to virtually remake the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for change is tremendous,'' Jacobson said.
``You're going to get a whole new opportunity for a governor to
appoint members who could be there for 30 or more years, and her
influence, her ideas, could carry on for that period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The state will be watching Shaheen very closely if she replaces
Brock and other judges. For that reason, said Marcus Hurn,
professor of law at the Franklin Pierce Law School, Shaheen will be
very careful to appoint judges with unimpeachable credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``After one of these big dust-ups, everybody's watching the
governor,'' he said. ``And the governor usually has the sense to
seek out very admired, judicious people, and you wind up with a
better court than average because everybody's on their best
behavior for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the high court judges have passed firmer rules on
recusals, no longer allowing disqualified judges to participate in
decisions, even to offer suggestions on punctuation and grammar.
</P>
<P>
   A vastly reshaped court could usher in the sort of dramatic
change that has taken root in the other branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scandal is really the result of personalities and the
ingrown, good-old-boy network of the state bar,'' said Linda
Fowler, professor of government and director of Rockefeller Center
at Dartmouth College. ``And to the extent that New Hampshire is a
small state and everybody knows each other and people kind of have
been inclined in the past to give each other the benefit of the
doubt, this scrutiny and the public outrage about it are going to
change some norms in the courthouse.''

MEANWHILE, THERE'S A RUN ON REVIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Revivals are tricky business when the play in
question has had what might be considered a definitive performance.
It can take a powerhouse interpretation to make you forget a
scintillating night of theater from the past and go with a
different flow.
</P>
<P>
   This has a particular relevance now that what could be called
the Paul Thomas Anderson Repertory Company has relocated from LA to
New York, with the stars of that director's ``Magnolia,'' ``Boogie
Nights,'' and ``Hard Eight'' surfacing on Broadway and off. Philip
Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly are alternating every third
performance as the bipolar brothers in Sam Shepard's ``True West,''
while William H. Macy and Philip Baker Hall hold forth in David
Mamet's ``American Buffalo.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cherry Jones, Gabriel Byrne, and Roy Dotrice are
starring in a remounting of Eugene O'Neill's ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten'' in a production free of Anderson alumni or actors
with three names. These are gutsy choices on the part of all these
actors, because others still cast a long shadow over these plays
even though a relatively small number of theatergoers saw them. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``True West'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sam Shepard's seminal play about family dysfunction pairs an
outlaw brother named Lee against Austin, a Hollywood screenwriter.
It's doubtful that the Steppenwolf production taped for PBS,
featuring then-little-known actors John Malkovich and Gary Sinise,
will ever be topped _ who could be more menacing than Malkovich?
</P>
<P>
   British director Matthew Warchus (``Art'') tries something
different by alternating Hoffman and Reilly after every three
performances. But Hoffman's performance as Lee is so buffoonish I
was ready to write Shepard off along with the actors _ Reilly
wasn't much better as Austin. A few days later, after they switched
roles, the whole operation made far more sense. Not only is Reilly
a hilarious Lee and Hoffman a wonderfully modulated Austin, but as
Hoffman gets less and less civilized his Austin turns into Lee as
he had played him a few days before. It's as if Warchus and Hoffman
are underlining a kind of randomness in Shepard's script, that a
turn here or there is enough to chart an entirely different path
for an individual.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most people can't afford to see the same play twice in a
limited run; if you're going only once, see Reilly as Lee and
Hoffman as Austin. Not only are they far better performances, but
Shepard's writing bristles with an intelligence and energy that
seems merely portentous with the roles reversed. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``American Buffalo'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mamet, too, can seem an empty vessel when not done right. Al
Pacino set the standard as Teach, the small-time con man with a
rapid-fire, foul-mouthed, spittle-spraying delivery. I always
thought Pacino was a little over the top and was looking forward to
William H. Macy, who had been dismissed as not fiery enough.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately the reviews were right. Macy captures more humor
in the part, and more of Teach's loser quality in the process, but
if director Neil Pepe's idea was that underplaying Mamet would
bring out more richness in the script, it doesn't work. ``American
Buffalo'' can be played at something less than full-tilt boogie,
but Mamet becomes irrelevant at a tempo this slow. Philip Baker
Hall doesn't help matters. His Donny is so uninvolved that if you
hadn't seen him shine in Anderson's films or elsewhere you might
think he was an elder acting student. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A Moon for the Misbegotten'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two productions of Eugene O'Neill's play stand side by side in
the memory _ the classic with Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst
that was taped for television (and will soon be available on home
video) and the American Repertory Theatre production with Ian
Bannen and Kate Nelligan.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say that the current revival with Gabriel Byrne and
Cherry Jones makes three, but Jones is such a fine Josie Hogan she
almost carries it into the pantheon. One wonders if she saw
Nelligan at ART when Jones was here, but it hardly matters. When
the acting is of such a high caliber, comparisons are academic.
O'Neill gives his characters more room to breathe than Mamet and
Shepard _ part of which makes him a better playwright _ and Jones
finds room of her own to breathe. Some critics have found an
actress as slight and pretty as Jones to be be an unsuitable earth
mother, but that's their lack of imagination, not Jones's.
</P>
<P>
   The performance I had trouble with was Byrne's. Perhaps
understatement is a problem with all these film actors, but Byrne's
James Tyrone is such a deadened zombie of a character that he has
nowhere to fall. It's the occasional sputters of life that Robards
and Bannen flashed that made their defeats so tragic.
</P>
<P>
   To the production's credit, Roy Dotrice all but steals his
scenes as Josie's father, who tries to unite the two misbegottens,
but even with his shenanigans, Jones's transformative abilities,
and O'Neill's poetic if overly boiled dialogue, this isn't quite a
full moon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``True West'' runs through June 4 at Circle in the Square;
``American Buffalo'' through May 21 at the Atlantic Theater
Company; and ``A Moon for the Misbegotten'' through June 18 at the
Walter Kerr Theatre.

TUCCI FINDS A MOVIE IN A TALE OF BLOCKED CREATIVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stanley Tucci, the lead actor, writer, and director
of ``Big Night,'' ``The Impostors,'' and, opening Friday, ``Joe
Gould's Secret,'' remembers _ daily _ a lesson he learned from one
of his acting professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love to watch people do common, everyday activities,''
Tucci recites, while sitting over lunch in a West Village
restaurant, not far from where much of his new film was shot.
``It's fascinating to watch somebody eat. It's fascinating to watch
somebody smoke a cigarette _ nothing else, just that. People will
be fascinated by that. What is that person thinking? What's going
to happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Renoir,'' he goes on, ``or Tarkovsky, at the most
extreme. Fellini _ `La Dolce Vita' is one of the most incredible
movies ever made, and there's no plot.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucci's own films reflect this lesson well. The ending of ``Big
Night'' _ a long, silent shot, in which his character, the owner of
a wonderful but failing Italian restaurant, cooks an omelet from
start to finish _ is one of the great movie endings of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Impostors'' is loaded with plot; it's a parody of plot.
But its priceless moments _ the scene where the unemployed actors,
played by Tucci and Oliver Platt, practice facial expressions, and
another where they connive to get free food from a baker _ are pure
character and situation.
</P>
<P>
   It's a perfect fit, then, for Tucci's latest film to be ``Joe
Gould's Secret,'' based on two articles that appeared in The New
Yorker, and were later combined into a book, by Joseph Mitchell. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mitchell's legacy &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who died four years ago at the age of 87, had, and
still has, a worshipful following, especially among other writers.
Calvin Trillin, the longtime New Yorker writer, once said he would
trade ``pretty much everything I've written for a paragraph of `Old
Mr. Flood' or `Joe Gould's Secret.' ''
</P>
<P>
   David Remnick, the magazine's current editor, treasures a
photograph of Mitchell and A. J. Liebling sitting together, the
pair representing a sort of yin and yang of the New Yorker style _
Liebling, as Remnick puts it, the ``Rabelaisian, Whitmanic writer
of appetite,'' Mitchell ``this completely austere, controlled,
haunted chronicler of the city and the human condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell wrote about a New York that no longer exists and that
even when he wrote about it, from the late 1930s through the
mid-1960s, was on the verge of vanishing. He wrote long, leisurely
profiles of gypsies, bartenders, oystermen, Mohawk steelworkers,
Bowery bums, and the assorted cranks, wannabes, couldabeens, and
get-alongs who give a neighborhood its character.
</P>
<P>
   A Mitchell essay typically began with a plain but evocative
description of a place _ a riverfront, a graveyard, a fish market,
a tavern, a city square. A character entered the picture, Mitchell
started up a conversation, and suddenly, seamlessly, the piece
became a meditation on life and death, or a mystery story, or a
tale of personal revelation, in an understated, time-suspending
way.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci, who is now 40, had never heard of Mitchell until seven
years ago, when his wife gave him, as a birthday present, ``Up in
the Old Hotel,'' a thick compilation of Mitchell's New Yorker
essays that had just been published.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew that I loved old New York and books about old New
York,'' Tucci remembers. ``I started reading, and quickly realized
this was the best writing I had ever read in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing that drew him was that, in a Mitchell piece, as Tucci
puts it, ``the drama is nonexistent. Or, rather, the drama is
simply existence. That is drama enough, or it is for me.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A collecting connection &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was another way in which Tucci, though 51 years younger
than Mitchell, felt a connection to the writer. When Tucci had
first moved to the city from suburban Westchester County in 1982 _
as an aspiring actor, just out of college, without much work or
much else to do _ he walked the streets, jotted notes about ideas,
sat in bars, talked and listened to people, and collected old
pieces of glass and metal from junk shops and demolished-building
sites.
</P>
<P>
   As he read more of ``Up in the Old Hotel,'' he discovered that
Mitchell loved to do exactly the same things. Mitchell was an
inveterate street-walker and building-admirer, and he kept a vast
collection of old doorknobs and hinges and bottlenecks and cornice
fragments that he had found, and meticulously labeled, over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, shortly after he finished the film, Tucci's
wife gave birth to twins. One of Mitchell's daughters _ who lives
in New Jersey and still has her father's antique remnants _ gave
him, to pass along to his twins, two silver spoons out of a
collection that Mitchell had taken from New York restaurants that
no longer exist. ``Wasn't that nice of her?'' Tucci says softly,
clearly still deeply touched.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci plays Mitchell in this film, and to delve into the role,
he listened over and over to tapes of interviews Mitchell gave to
National Public Radio, getting down cold his soft North Carolina
accent and his hesitant cadences.
</P>
<P>
   Trillin, who knew Mitchell for 30 years, says of Tucci's
performance, ``He was Mitchell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Gould's Secret'' is the best known, and possibly the best,
of Mitchell's works. As Mitchell described his subject in his first
sentence, ``Joe Gould is a blithe and emaciated little man who has
been a notable in the cafeterias, diners, barrooms, and dumps of
Greenwich Village for a quarter of a century.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The man behind the story &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gould was a white-bearded chatterbox, the scion of a rich Boston
family and a Harvard graduate who descended into a jolly, and
erratically brilliant, madness. He called himself ``the last of the
bohemians,'' and claimed to be writing a book called ``An Oral
History of Our Time,'' which he said was approaching 9 million
words and which he compared to Edward Gibbon's ``The History of the
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.'' Short essays, supposedly
taken from his tome, were published by prestigious literary
journals of the day, and were admired by E. E. Cummings, Ezra
Pound, and William Saroyan.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell hung out for hours and months with Gould (played in the
film by Ian Holm), taking down his blatherings and his life story.
The New Yorker published the first of two pieces he would write
about Gould in 1942, under the title ``Professor Seagull'' (taken
from Gould's claim that he had figured out seagull language and had
translated ``a number of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poems'' into
the argot).
</P>
<P>
   Gould died in 1957 in a mental hospital. Several litterateurs
hunted for the ``Oral History'' manuscript, said to be stored at
some farmhouse in Long Island. Mitchell, when asked, often joined
the search party. Then, in 1964, he wrote a sequel, ``Joe Gould's
Secret,'' and revealed _ with no less tenderness or respect than he
had paid him in his first essay _ that the manuscript did not exist
and that he had known this, had shared and kept this secret of
Gould's, for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Gould's Secret'' was the last work to appear under
Mitchell's byline. It is the stuff of legend that, for the next 36
years, Mitchell regularly showed up at his New Yorker office, could
often be heard banging away at his typewriter, but never produced
another article.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious parallels were drawn, sometimes by Mitchell himself.
He recounted in that final essay that, for a long time, he had an
idea for a novel. He described its outline, a good many of its
details and flourishes. But, like Gould, he never sat down to write
his magnum opus. He later remarked to friends, ``Joe Gould _ that's
me.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Getting Tucci's take &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of Tucci's films are, in one way or another, about the comic
struggles of the artistic process and the various forces that try
to thwart it _ a saga perhaps inspired by his own career of, until
recently, small parts in undistinguished works (for example, the
bad guy in the ``Beethoven'' dog movie).
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Night'' is about a brilliant chef driven to cook in his
own way, without compromise, even though it means the collapse of
his restaurant _ and about the slick businessman across the street
who serves up terrible food but packs them in every night.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the film's original distributors, at MGM, wanted
Tucci to tack on an extra scene after the great omelet-cooking
shot, in which the phone rings and reservations start pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really shocked,'' Tucci recalls of the meeting where the
suits proposed this new ending. ``I was thinking, `Oh yeah, that's
a sure-fire hit, they'll come in by the millions for that.'
Audiences would have hated that. I don't think audiences always
want happy endings. They're not as afraid of ambiguity as some
people think they are.'' (MGM dropped the film when Tucci refused
to change it.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Impostors,'' though more farcical, was about a fight
between a pair of hapless but dedicated actors who can't get work
and a dreadful actor who's unjustly rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   There are no villains in ``Joe Gould's Secret,'' only creators
thwarted by their own internal demons _ Gould, who was too crazy to
set anything down, and Mitchell, who may finally have been too
haunted by his own demanding standards.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci these days goes back and forth between acting in big
Hollywood movies (``to put a roof over my head'') and making the
small films he cares about, sometimes acting in other small
ventures just because he likes them. (For three days of work on
``Daytrippers,'' a delightful independent film a few years ago, he
was paid $225.)
</P>
<P>
   He says the next film he plans to direct, which takes place in
his hometown in Westchester County, ``has nothing to do with the
creative process.'' Which may be a sign that _ after creating three
movies that bear his signature, without compromise, to critical
(and even some commercial) success _ Tucci has laid his own demons
to rest.

WILD DECEMBERS 
By Edna O'Brien. 
Houghton Mifflin. 259 pp. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ireland may be the only place in the world where talk is cheap
and also priceless. The island's oral sensibility is one of gossip
bumping into literature: a collision of pub fights, fence-hanging
yarns, and the poetry of the gods. Joyce understood this first and
best, of course; his exaltation of the ordinary simply and forever
changed the face of fiction. His intrepid heiress-apparent, Edna
O'Brien, has spent the last four decades celebrating a similarly
fecund narrative world of the bawdy and sublime; for her efforts,
she saw her first seven novels banned in her homeland _ the first
one toasted on the chapel grounds by her own parish priest.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``Wild Decembers,'' she has given talk itself the power
of a sweet-tongued devil. It's there in the ancient legends that
hover over rural Cloontha, ``a locality within the bending of an
arm,'' and there in the old grudges and new rumors that dictate the
order of things. It's there in Cloontha's bars and beauty salons,
in its misunderstandings and land disputes and murderous threats.
Most of all, it's there in the evolution of narrative: the way we
hear, interpret, then reweave the facts into intractably human
truths _ where fields ``mean more than fields . . . fields lost,
regained, and lost again in that fickle and fractured sequence of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this is a story about ceaseless rain and
turf-cutting and tragedy, more Thomas Hardy than Joyce in its mists
of preordained misery. The final volume of a trilogy, ``Wild
Decembers'' follows ``House of Splendid Isolation'' and ``Down by
the River''; what links the novels is not a specific story line,
but the shroud of Irish history, where passion begets violence and
where honor generally commands the price of blood. You can tell
from the first paragraph this is O'Brien country, with its sucking
calves and golden bogs and too-sweet smells of earth and death. Few
other writers take you inside a fictional realm so utterly and
swiftly by way of language _ by the sheer internal sounds and look
of words upon the page.
</P>
<P>
   The feuding sons of her classical story are Mick Bugler,
returning from a few years of self-exile on a sheep farm in
Australia, and Joseph Brennan, the elder brother of a sheltered
young woman named Breege. The two men's ancestors fought for years
over rights to their abutting lands, the history of which is
recorded in pub talk and memory, and maybe in the dusty archives of
a land office miles away. With the look and air of a dark-horse
charmer, Bugler possesses the only tractor on the mountain _ and,
within a matter of weeks, the heretofore-unclaimed attentions of
Breege. The Brennans' parents died when Breege was a young girl,
and Joseph moved in to fill the void; his subsequent protectiveness
of his sister her is only slightly mollified by his initial
affection for Bugler.
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances conspire to alter this fleeting harmony. Angry
sentiments are exchanged over the tractor, which, for all its
suggestion of modernity's forward march, winds up broken down on
Joseph's land. Word arrives of a fiance, Rosemary, soon to join
Bugler, thereby eclipsing any idea of a future for him and Breege.
These embers of discord are transformed into a brushfire by the
collective mischief of Cloontha's residents. A pair of conniving
sisters, Rita and Reena, decide to torment and even ruin Bugler
after they've failed to draw him into their web. The local misfit,
known as the Crock, is a physically deformed man who has led a life
of humiliation and rage; his bitterness has festered over the years
into malevolence, and Breege _ by the simple fact of her innocent
disregard _ becomes his target. Within a matter of months, rumor
and malice have turned into allegations and court fights, with
Joseph and Bugler each threatening the other through hired
solicitors as well as physical assault. Breege, her loyalties
divided but her heart resolute, finds herself alone in the barn
with Bugler for one splendid moment _ which is just long enough to
change everything, forever, for them both.
</P>
<P>
   This is an old, old story _ I kept thinking of Alfred Noyes's
``The Highwayman'' and Hardy's ``Tess'' _ with a darkness you can
see coming from clear across the moors. And yet O'Brien has filled
it with a resplendent ache that is hers alone. The novel breathes
with animal symbolism: a martyred greyhound, named after her
birthplace of Violet Hill; lowing calves, crying for their mothers;
a lost and exquisitely fragile butterfly, hostage to the mercy of
the man who holds it. These moments imbue the novel with a sense of
mystical doom, as unstoppable as spilled blood or a setting sun. At
such times the narration is Faulknerian in its alliterative march
toward destiny; when Breege's voice occasionally takes over, the
story feels stripped-down and piercing. This is an etching of a
tragedy, perfectly delineated, its boundaries set by land rights
and misdeeds and the very limitations of the human heart _ an inner
territory of beauty and imprisonment that is Ireland on the edge of
time, what O'Brien calls ``the confines of the place, back out to
the far reaches of the mountain, the ballerina birch, and the
fugitive amethyst river.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien has taken the title for ``Wild Decembers'' from an Emily
Bronte poem, and with it she has brought the same heather-tinged
heartache that clung to all those 19th-century heaths. It's
testament to the old-fashioned feel of the novel that you hardly
notice what decade it is until Rosemary arrives wearing thigh-high
boots; much of rural Ireland, after all, is a stubbornly sovereign
land of preindustrial passions. And when progress does arrive at
little, well-insulated Cloontha, it does so with all the power and
destructive possibility of a freight train. ``You can go years and
years of normal life,'' thinks Breege, ``all day, every day,
milking, foddering, saying the given things, and then one day
something opens in you, wild and marvellous, like the great rills
that run down the mountain in the rain, rapid, jouncing, turning
everything they touch into something living; a mossy log suddenly
having the intent and slither of a crocodile.'' It's that
crocodile, heavy-eyed and treacherous, arriving at the end of a
passage of great beauty, that sets Edna O'Brien apart. No mere lush
romantic, she knows that great change and desolation are two
different aspects of the same darkening sky.

THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT 
Narrated by: Hugh Sidey 
Written, produced and directed by: Philip B. Kunhardt Jr., Philip
B. Kunhardt 3d, Peter W. Kunhardt 
On: PBS 
Time: 9 p.m., through Thursday 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the numerous virtues of ``The American President'' is
that it shows us what a capacious joint the White House is.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider the remarkably different figures who have called
it home. There was Franklin Delano Roosevelt (in office 1933-45), a
man whose ebullience, empathy, and self-confidence (``Above all,
try something,'' he said in the depths of the Depression) supplied
a dose of optimism to a nation desperately in need of it.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Benjamin Harrison (1889-93), who glumly
opined that a president's life is ``like that of the policeman in
the opera: not a happy one,'' then went on to prove it. Harrison's
interactions with citizens were so cold that he became known as
``the human iceberg.'' When a friend urged him to ``for God's sake,
be human,'' Harrison rejoined: ``I tried it, but I failed. I'll
never try it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison's presidency was utterly forgettable, while Roosevelt's
represents an indelible chapter in our history. The times they
lived in had a lot to do with that, of course. But the useful
lesson of ``The American President'' is that the nation's chief
executives leave their stamp on the office not just by their words
and deeds, but through the sense of self they transmit to the
country they govern; in other words, through their personality.
</P>
<P>
   To a striking degree, the series argues, a president's character
shapes the nation's destiny. George Washington, while ``easily
embarrassed by his lack of learning,'' possessed the wisdom and
strength of character to spurn an offer to become king of the newly
liberated country. (``Banish these thoughts,'' he said.) John
Tyler's forceful personality helped clarify the question of
vice-presidential succession. The Constitution was vague on that
issue, so when William Henry Harrison died, it wasn't clear whether
Tyler, his vice president, would serve as president or as a
temporary caretaker. The Cabinet believed it was the latter, but
Tyler disabused them of that notion in their first meeting, saying:
``I am the president. When you think otherwise, your resignation
will be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   With 41 chief executives to cover, the series moves too quickly
to cover any individual presidency in detail. But what it lacks in
depth, it makes up for in sweep. The thematic links it establishes
among the presidents are generally sound; for instance, Tuesday
night's installment covers four presidents largely defined by
foreign policy (Monroe, McKinley, Wilson, Bush), and Wednesday's
looks at four generals who became president (Washington, Grant,
Eisenhower, William Henry Harrison). The series has an eye for the
telling detail, noting, for instance, that one in every seven
people on the podium during John F. Kennedy's inauguration was a
member of the Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
   A respect for the presidency pervades the series, which is fine
except when the tone becomes overly celebratory. However majestic a
figure George Washington was, it's distracting to hear a brass
fanfare playing behind the narration. Also, no mention is made of
Washington's ownership of slaves, a rather large contradiction in a
man who symbolized this country's fight for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome volume published in conjunction with the series
(and sharing its title) notes that the 41 presidents have been
``all men, all white, and all Christian.'' It adds optimistically
that the country is ``moving inexorably toward greater inclusion.''

CAPTURING THE PARADOX OF FDR VEEP HENRY WALLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
AMERICAN DREAMER 
A Life of Henry A. Wallace 
By John C. Culver and John Hyde 
Norton, 608 pp., illustrated, $35 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an oral history that Henry A. Wallace recorded near the end
of his life, he concluded that it was good he had missed out on
becoming president in 1945, after the death of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, because no one as divisive and controversial as he could
have led the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had been Roosevelt's vice president from 1940 to 1944 _
forced on the party by FDR, who saw his rumpled, even eccentric
secretary of agriculture as a philosopher who would ``help the
people think.'' But when he ran for a fourth term, Roosevelt
allowed the party bosses to dump Wallace from the ticket and
replace him with the more comfortable and conventional Harry S
Truman.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace is remembered today mainly for his own quixotic and
red-baited 1948 campaign _ Cambridge radicals of a certain age can
wistfully sing the campaign verse (written to the tune of the old
folk song ``Passing Through'') that begins: ``Yes, I was at
Franklin Roosevelt's side, just a while before he died.''
</P>
<P>
   In this fine biography, John C. Culver, a former United States
senator from Wallace's home state of Iowa, and John Hyde, a former
reporter for The Des Moines Register, have not just revived and
rehabilitated a barely remembered political figure, they have
captured the paradox of a man who could be so widely admired and so
deeply hated.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was born on a farm, in October 1888, and the family's
major enterprise was agricultural journalism, publishing the
influential and widely read Wallace's Farmer. And had he never been
pulled into politics, he would deserve attention as an agricultural
economist and innovator _ principally for his role in developing a
hybrid corn that is now planted worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely has a public figure's talent so perfectly matched his
opportunity,'' write Culver and Hyde of Wallace on his taking over
the Agriculture Department in the grim Depression year of 1933.
``Born to a family whose very mission was he preservation of
agriculture, (he) had become the mobilizing general of just such an
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The party leaders who swallowed their anger when Wallace was
forced on them in 1940 got even four years later, moved mainly by
concerns that Roosevelt would not live out a fourth term and that
Wallace was too unpredictable, too undependable, to serve as
president. The account Culver and Hyde provide of the 1944 national
convention _ ``six astonishing days,'' they call it _ is a
masterpiece of political writing, from the maneuverings to win
Roosevelt's support for Truman to Wallace's own electrifying speech
nominating Roosevelt ``in the cause of liberalism,'' which
threatened to undo the plotters.
</P>
<P>
   The most contentious issue that any study of Wallace must
address is his split with Truman over foreign policy and
international control of the atomic bomb _ and, as a consequence,
the charge that Wallace was, if not a communist, certainly too
friendly toward the Soviet Union. Culver and Hyde track the
development of this issue carefully and comprehensively.
</P>
<P>
   From their account, it is clear that Wallace too often left
himself open to red-baiting and that his enemies took advantage of
every opportunity to target him. As presidential adviser Clark
Clifford put it in a strategy memo for Truman's 1948 campaign,
``every effort must be made . . . to identify and isolate him in
the public mind with the Communists.''
</P>
<P>
   And it worked. As Culver and Hyde write, ``everything had turned
on its head. The quiet son of Iowa soil had been transformed in the
public mind into a wild-eyed fanatic bent on destroying the
American way of life. . . . The deeply religious grandson of a
Presbyterian minister had become an apostle of godless
totalitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the politics and the controversy, Wallace, in the hands
of two skillful _ and admiring _ biographers, becomes an engaging
personality: an odd stick, but charmingly so. When he proposed to
his future wife, he presented her with a bag of diamonds borrowed
from a trusting local jeweler. ``Here,'' he told her, ``pick one
out.'' She slept fitfully that night with the bag under her pillow.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Truman administration _ the last of the
Roosevelt cabinet members to do so _ Wallace was for a time editor
of The New Republic. Often he would disappear from the office in
the company of ``a mysterious man'' he called Max. His publisher
feared that ``Max'' was some kind of ``political agent.'' But no,
he was a retired East Side grocer who would take Wallace around to
neighborhood delicatessens _ from which he would return ``with his
overcoat pockets stuffed with tins of gefilte fish and bottles of
borscht.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final 17 years of his life after the 1948 campaign,
Culver and Hyde write, Wallace ``never returned to the good graces
of the broad American public.'' If for no other reason than that, a
full-scale biography of Wallace is welcome. That is it also a
masterful portrait of so fascinating a man makes it all the more
welcome.

MUSEUM DETAILS NAZI'S ROLE IN ARTWORK ON ITS WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN DEZELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On Friday, George Shackelford, chair of European
paintings at the Museum of Fine Arts, was grabbing faxes, fielding
phone calls, and retrieving e-mail about a 17th-century Italian
painting in the museum's collection once owned by a notorious
Nazi-era art dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The information reduced the possibility that Domenico Fetti's
``Parable of the Good Samaritan'' was one of tens of thousands of
art objects stolen from Jewish families and art sellers during the
Third Reich. And so an image of the painting _ and most of what
Shackelford knows about it _ was posted on the Internet
(www.mfa.org) Saturday as the MFA launches a site that illustrates
and annotates as many as nine works of art whose history of
ownership suggests they may have been plundered.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA's move is an effort to address growing concerns about
the possible presence in American museums of what are known as
spoliated works _ and criticism that institutions have not been
quick enough to reveal what they know about those pieces.
</P>
<P>
   But the MFA's response to what is surely the most volatile issue
in the art and exhibition worlds today may provoke more questions
than resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Museum of Fine Arts is absolutely in the forefront of
museums that are doing the right thing in posting suspicious art on
the Web that allows anyone who has a legitimate claim to it to come
forward,'' said Jehuda Reinharz, president of Brandeis University
and a member of the Presidential Commission on Holocaust Assets in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the information that has emerged and the burgeoning
public awareness about Nazi-era art in recent years, provenance
research at the MFA and elsewhere is a wide-ranging, painstaking,
and not always fruitful process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Provenance is different for virtually every painting,'' said
Shackelford. ``Many of our Monets have unbroken lineage. Monet's
`Haystack With Snow,' for example, went from the artist to the
dealer, Durand-Ruel, to Horatio Lamb of Boston, to Aimee and
Rosamund Lamb, who gave it to the museum in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is much more typical, particularly with older paintings,
is that you have a run of provenances, then have a big break
because transfers from hand to hand were not publicly conducted, or
records were not kept.''
</P>
<P>
   Shackelford randomly opened a recent catalog raisonne _
considered the definitive record of a work's ownership history _
and pointed to an entry for Paul Cezanne's ``La Maison Rustique''
(circa 1879), which is at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Mass.
The catalog shows that the painting changed hands seven times, but
entries about three of those exchanges appear with question marks.
</P>
<P>
   The Fetti is considered suspicious because it was handled by
Gustav Rochlitz before it was acquired by the collector Frederick
Haussman, who sold it to the Hans Schaeffer Galleries, the New York
dealer from which the MFA bought it in 1946. Rochlitz, a German
dealer, was an art adviser to Nazi field marshal and avid collector
Hermann Goering, and a key figure in the Nazi plunder of Jewish art
collections and dealerships in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA learned last week that Hausmann owned the painting as
early as 1941, and that he was living in New York then, ``which
takes it out of the realm of a lot of looting during the war,''
said Shackelford. ``What we don't know is where it was before
1941.'' Shackelford traced the painting to a 1927 exhibition whose
records show that Rochlitz lent it. He might have bought and sold
the Fetti legally before the Nazis came to power, ``but we don't
know,'' he said. That is why the Fetti will be on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some works of art that you'll never be able to pin
down, because information about them was destroyed or is still
classified or was never there,'' said Constance Lowenthal, of the
Committee for Art Recovery of the World Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The hope among Jewish advocacy organizations, the Commission on
Art Recovery, and museums is that releasing information on art
works will not only lead to the recovery of stolen property _ some
of it worth millions of dollars _ but will yield more information.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that tens of thousands of paintings, sculptures, and
decorative objects owned by Jewish families and collectors were
systematically pillaged during World War II emerged at the end of
the Cold War, as long-sequestered records and objects increasingly
became available to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, interest in the Holocaust, seminal books on World
War II plunder and its aftermath, and press investigations,
including several in the Globe, widened and deepened public
awareness of the thousands of works of ``homeless'' art in museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became very clear to the museum community that this cannot
be ignored and that they have to do something proactive to
demonstrate that what they own or possess is truly the museum's
property, instead of sitting back and waiting for claims,'' said
Lowenthal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the American Association of Museum Directors adopted
guidelines for museums to identify and deal with claims for
spoliated objects. The standards call for the organizations to
conduct comprehensive reviews of their collections to determine
whether any works were stolen during the Nazi era and to address
problematic pieces ``candidly and responsively.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the past year, heirs to an Henri Matisse painting at the
Seattle Art Museum and one by Lucas Cranach the Elder at the North
Carolina Museum of Art have resulted in the return of stolen
property. Most major museums have begun reviews of their
collections, and while some claims for restitution or compensation
from museums are mired in legal conflict, there is a sense among
institution leaders that ``the system is working,'' said James
Cuno, head of the Harvard Art Museums. ``The problem for
noncontinental museums such as ours is usually not that we hold
works of art that have a legacy of confiscation. Usually, it is the
second- or third-generation ownership of art. We're dealing with
objects purchased by people in good faith, and we have to trace it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowenthal and Reinharz credit the museums with progress in
researching and identifying problematic art. But Elan Steinberg,
executive director of the World Jewish Congress, maintains that
museums have come to this point with reluctance, and are not moving
quickly enough to determine whether ``they have clear title to
these works. It's all very good that they're beginning to fulfill
their principles of two years ago, but it wasn't until there was a
public outcry that we began to see movement here.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grossman, an MFA trustee and Jewish community leader,
downplayed the differences in approach among those concerned about
questionable art.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue in which you have scholarship, you have
politics, you have a moral imperative, and the most tragic event of
the 20th century rolled into one. Sometimes it's very hard to see
the motivations of other individuals or groups. But if you think
about it, all of them are entirely legitimate and honorable. At the
end of the day, Malcolm (Rogers, MFA director) has implemented a
bold plan that recognizes the museum's concerns, a moral
imperative, and good public policy.''

<P>
   RAMPAGE-KILLERS-III (Salt Lake City) _ With the voices inside
her head ordering her to kill, Lisa Duy walked into Doug's Shoot'n
Sports here to buy a semiautomatic pistol. The manager, Dave
Larsen, ran a background check on her and the agency quickly
approved the sale, having found no record of felony convictions or
mental illness. The only thing unusual, Larsen thought, was that as
she left the store, Ms. Duy was wearing the shooting-range ear
protectors he had lent her. Less than two hours later, on Jan. 14,
1999, Miss Duy, ear protectors still in place, walked into the
studios of television station KSL and began firing her new weapon.
She shot more than four dozen times in all, killing a young mother
and wounding the building manager. What the background check had
been unable to detect was that Ms. Duy had a long history of
psychiatric problems. Of the 100 episodes of rampage killings
examined for this series by The New York Times, none better
illustrates than the case of Lisa Duy just how difficult it can be
to enforce a key provision of the nation's fundamental gun control
law. That provision prohibits people who have been involuntarily
committed to mental institutions from buying a handgun. But laws in
most states guard the privacy of the mentally ill, so gun
background checks typically fail to turn up mental health
histories. By Fox Butterfield.

   MARINE-PLANE-CRASH (Washington) _ The Pentagon killed the V-22
Osprey 11 years ago. Too expensive, too experimental, it said. But
the plane, a hybrid helicopter/turboprop, wouldn't die. Congress
kept it alive. No one fought harder than Rep. Curt Weldon, from the
Pennsylvania district where the aircraft would be built. Now 3 of
the 15 finished craft have crashed, killing 26 soldiers. The
aircraft remains expensive, experimental _ and exemplary of the way
weapons are built for today's military. The Pentagon has now
grounded the Ospreys that haven't already crashed. By Tim Weiner.

   Zimbabwe is in crisis. The blame lies almost entirely with

the country since it gained independence from Britain in 1980.

   &UR; CHINA-DEMYSTIFIED-ECONOMIST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The West cannot quite make up its mind about how it wants to
deal with China. In America, big business lobbies Congress to treat
China as a normal trading nation, while Congress urges the Clinton
administration to sell more weapons to Taiwan, as defense against
Communist Chinese threats. Golden economic prize (2.6 billion
armpits to deodorize) or rising international menace (those ugly
threats)? Is China one or the other? Both or neither? &QL;

   After Keizo Obuchi's stroke last weekend, Japan has had to find

after the general election, due sometime before autumn. Alas, Japan

   America's arid Southwest is attracting people faster than any
other part of the country. Maintaining quality of life, while
continuing to attract the firms that will provide the jobs to
sustain population growth at almost three times the national rate,
is a balancing act. For Phoenix, the answer may be the Internet.
After all, an industry that doesn't need too much space, and brings
in a lot of money and not too many people, seems like a good
prospect for a city that wants to slow down a bit. Could Phoenix be
the next Silicon Valley? &QL;

   Even in the age of negative politics, there is something a

   Half a century or so ago, the Ku Klux Klan was remembered for

   Ending child labor in Pakistan can have unexpected consequences.
In the mid-1990s, Pakistani soccer-ball manufacturers were under
attack when the western press discovered that they were employing
children for 80-hour-a-week shifts, working for pennies in near
darkness. The industry hastily made profound changes and, three
years later, child labor in Sialkot's soccer industry is mostly
history. The effects, though, have been double-edged. Like soccer
itself, getting rid of child labor is not always a win-win game. &QL;

deal with China. In America, big business lobbies Congress to treat
China as a normal trading nation, while Congress urges the Clinton
administration to sell more weapons to Taiwan, as defense against
Communist Chinese threats. Golden economic prize (2.6 billion
armpits to deodorize) or rising international menace (those ugly
threats)? Is China one or the other? Both or neither? &QL;

   America's arid Southwest is attracting people faster than any

   ``If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all
others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking
power called an idea... No one possesses the less, because every
other possess the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me,
receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who
lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Thomas Jefferson's inspiring vision, there are no barriers to
the acquisition of knowledge. Nobody owns it, everybody partakes of
it _ and the world becomes richer.
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries later, when knowledge has taken over much of the
economy, Jefferson's words seem to take on a new power. After all,
capital has always been one of the main economic barriers to entry,
and these days ideas are capital.
</P>
<P>
   If getting hold of capital becomes as easy as getting a light,
barriers to entry everywhere ought to be tumbling. So farewell,
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   But how is it, in that case, that in America, one of the biggest
antitrust cases in history reached judgment this week, causing
turmoil in financial markets? And how is it that new monopolies in
cyberspace are being created all the time?
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that ideas are not in practice the free currency
that Jefferson observed them to be in their natural state.
Governments award property rights over ideas, making them
vulnerable to monopolists if the system is abused.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft case is in many ways an old-fashioned sort of
antitrust affair about a dominant firm bullying smaller rivals. But
behind it lies a systemic worry, about the wired world's natural
susceptibility to monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the value of any good (say, a computer operating
system) depends on the number of users; so a new entrant has little
hope against a widely used product (say, Windows).
</P>
<P>
   The American administration has rightly become more alert to
incipient network monopolies of this kind. Which makes its policy
on patents even odder.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are the strongest form of intellectual-property right,
since they give holders a claim over ideas encapsulated in a work,
and not just (as copyright does) on the work's particular form.
Their purpose is to reward inventors so as to encourage future
invention.
</P>
<P>
   Society is balancing the benefits of a free exchange of ideas
against future gains from further invention. And the means of
striking this balance is to award a legal monopoly to a
patent-holder for 20 years from the date of application.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are booming: last year, the United States Patent and
Trademark Office awarded 161,000, nearly twice as many as ten years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because the value of knowledge has grown relative
to other assets _ so companies naturally want more of it. But it is
also because new kinds of patents are being awarded, in areas that
might have been thought unpatentable, such as computer software,
genetic engineering and, increasingly, Internet business methods.
</P>
<P>
   In this last category, America's patent office has recently
handed out monopolies on such simple ideas as group buying,
matching professionals with those seeking advice, one-click
shopping and reverse auctions.
</P>
<P>
   The patent office says there is no reason not to issue such
patents: they fulfil the criteria that ideas embodied in a patent
application must be novel, useful and non-obvious.
</P>
<P>
   But that invites a big question: does the law, which has barely
been changed in two centuries, still work? The patent office
retorts that the system's durability is testimony to its success,
as are the waves of technological change it has fostered.
</P>
<P>
   History's great inventors armed themselves with sheaves of
patents _ Edison, still the record-holder, had 1,093. Without such
protection, they would not have bothered.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet casts doubt on the need for such strong protection
today. Until recently, it was a patent-free zone in which good
ideas travelled freely. Clever people and capital flooded in. They
did not, apparently, need the incentive that patent protection
would have provided.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with the law is that it does not differentiate
between the incentives needed to invest in different kinds of
technologies. It accords as much protection to an idea thought up
in the bath as to a drug that may have taken many years and
hundreds of millions of dollars to move from conception to
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jeff Bezos, founder of the Internet retailer Amazon and the
holder of several business-method patents, has suggested in an open
letter posted on the Internet that software and business-method
patents should have a shorter life than other patents _ say, three
to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Inventors still need some protection, but they are getting too
much. America needs to scrap its one-size-fits all system, and
replace it with one that responds to the investment that an
invention represents.
</P>
<P>
   Patents should come in different shapes and sizes, or the system
will go on producing absurdities. &QL;

   The American Supreme Court foresaw the danger in 1882, when
ruling on the matter of boat-propeller technology: ``Such an
indiscriminate creation of exclusive privileges tends rather to
obstruct than to stimulate invention. It creates a class of
speculative schemers who make it their business to watch the
advancing wave of improvement, and gather its foam in the form of
patented monopolies, which enable them to lay a heavy tax on the
industry of the country, without contributing anything to the real
advancement of the arts.'' &QL;

<P>
   It may have come as a shock to the markets, but few others can
have been surprised that Microsoft was this week found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the antitrust case against the software firm ruled
that it was a monopoly that had demonstrated a pattern of abuse,
done ``violence to the competitive process'' and ``placed an
oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune, thereby
guaranteeing its continued dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the verdict suggests that hopes of a negotiated
settlement were always slim. Too often in the past, Bill Gates's
firm has staved off punishment by appearing to accept restraints on
its behavior, only to cock a snook at regulators and resume its
aggressive business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gates talks earnestly about having ``gone the last
mile'' to achieve a settlement, Microsoft's proposals were too
limited, vague and loophole-ridden to be enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the Justice Department, and the 19 states
that joined it in the action, regard Microsoft as a hardened
recidivist that cannot be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   As the courtroom drama moves on to consider remedies, that same
lack of trust is sure to lead the plaintiffs to demand penalties of
a severe and far-reaching nature. That will not, however, make the
judge's task any easier.
</P>
<P>
   The two main aims are easy to state, but hard to balance. The
first requirement is that the remedies should deal with the central
problem, which is Microsoft's systematic exploitation of its
Windows operating-system monopoly to foreclose potential
competition, stifle innovation and gouge consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The second requirement is that the remedies should not damage
Microsoft's own ability to innovate.
</P>
<P>
   A package of conduct remedies along the lines rejected by
Microsoft in the settlement talks might just about have met the
first aim.
</P>
<P>
   It included provisions to stop Microsoft pricing Windows to
reward PC makers who do its bidding while punishing others; to stop
it tying products to Windows by sales contract; to end exclusionary
contracts; and to stop driving sales up by raising the price of
older versions of Windows whenever a new release comes out.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft would also have had to offer a version of Windows
without its Internet Explorer browser and to publish details of new
versions of its system as soon as they became available to its own
developers.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with all these proposals is that they are
essentially retrospective (``saving Netscape with hindsight''), and
they are unlikely to stimulate new competition. They would also
require permanent and intrusive policing.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, such conduct remedies would not meet the second
requirement, because they would not preserve what is good about
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   A future as a semi-regulated monopoly on never-ending probation
_ still highly profitable, but increasingly dull-witted and
unrewarding to work for _ would be a living death.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft hopes to avoid such a fate by betting on a more
sympathetic hearing on appeal. It may even get one, but it is
highly unlikely that the company will emerge unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   There is no knowing which way the Supreme Court, which is where
this matter will ultimately be resolved, will swing, but it would
not be the first time in the course of this case that Microsoft has
miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the more extreme solution of breaking the firm up
into at least two Windows companies and an applications firm might
now be the best outcome, not only for the Justice Department but
also for Microsoft itself.
</P>
<P>
   It would bring the discipline of real competition to the
operating-system companies, and release a wave of pent-up
innovation from the firm's clever staff.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it would put an end to Microsoft's unhealthy
passion for vertical integration and proprietary standards.
</P>
<P>
   A bolder and more imaginative Gates would now consider
restructuring the company along these lines himself, as a better
and more creative alternative to the terrifying legal lottery that
he appears to have chosen. &QL;

WEST'S MACHIAVELLI IS NO BETTER THAN IRAQ'S HUSSEIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Slowly, inexorably, a generation is being crushed in Iraq.
Thousands are dying, thousands more are leading stunted lives, and
storing up bitter hatreds for the future.
</P>
<P>
   No fair-minded person could doubt that the man ultimately
responsible is Saddam Hussein: he could return his country to
respectability tomorrow if he wished, and to relative prosperity
the day after.
</P>
<P>
   But Hussein is guileful as well as guilty, and the tormentor of
Iraq has manipulated events so that the West, through its
insistence on the continuance of the United Nations' sanctions, has
become the instrument of his countrymen's torment.
</P>
<P>
   At some stage, the West must decide whether it is prepared to go
on being used in this way. This, a moment of relative calm,
presents an opportunity to reconsider a policy that is now almost
ten years old.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable success of the policy so far is that Hussein
has been forced to destroy most of his lethal armory and is
constrained in his ability to use the biological weapons he is
surely developing.
</P>
<P>
   Any relaxation of the sanctions regime will almost certainly
help him a bit, at least in his presumed ambitions to wage
biological war.
</P>
<P>
   Since his record amply justifies the belief that he would, if he
could, one day exploit any capability for belligerence, any gains
the West might make from a change in policy must be set against the
loss in letting him strengthen his armory.
</P>
<P>
   So is there scope for any relaxation at all? A complete lifting
of all sanctions and constraints is out of the question. The aim,
rather, should be to remove the burden of sanctions from Iraqis at
large and direct it as much as possible at Saddam and his henchmen.
</P>
<P>
   That is the intention behind the oil-for-food scheme, an
arrangement that lets Iraq sell some of its oil, under U.N.
supervision, in exchange for food and medicine. Unfortunately, it
does not work.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is shattered, Iraqis scrabble for an
ever-more-miserable living, hundreds of children die each week _
and Hussein is still in power.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he can go about most of his business, whether building
palaces or making missiles, without any of the prying by the U.N.'s
inspectors that did so much to destroy his weapons program in the
1990s; after a split in the Security Council in 1998, and before a
round of bombing, they pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   So, thanks to cheating and smuggling, Hussein is slowly
gathering his strength while his people languish and the West is
blamed. That is the nub of the case for change.
</P>
<P>
   One possible course of action would be to amend the oil-for-food
scheme, making it easier for Iraq to import innocuous items needed
to repair its infrastructure and oil industry, while trying to keep
out the really dangerous imports and monitoring the items that may
be used for benign or malign purposes.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, though fine in theory, has already been tried,
without much success in practice. As long as the scheme exists,
Hussein can manipulate it to his ends.
</P>
<P>
   So let Iraq export its own oil freely but keep the ban on all
weapons-making wherewithal and check as many of Iraq's suspicious
imports as possible?
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with that idea is that, within Iraq's borders, the
monitors would at best be able to check on the use of approved
machinery; they could not insist on entering any laboratory or
other suspicious building at random.
</P>
<P>
   And checking imports before they entered Iraq would be
laborious, and certainly not entirely effective.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hussein could get his hands on more money, and
therefore on more components for missiles and weapons. He is,
however, getting those anyway, just as he is carrying on most of
his activities largely uninspected.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. monitors do oversee the distribution of food and medicine
and check that spare parts for the oil industry are properly used,
but Iraq shows no sign being willing to readmit weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Under a British-American plan, accepted by the Security Council
in December, a new inspection team is to present itself this month.
Unfortunately, however, Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
has already condemned it as ``stillborn'' and ``unworkable.''
</P>
<P>
   If, against expectations, the plan succeeds, well and good. If
it fails, America and Britain should continue to press for as much
monitoring as possible but show themselves ready to abandon
sanctions on oil sales in favor of dual-use inspections and import
checks, coupled with an unequivocal warning that any evidence of
cheating, let alone any threatening activity, will bring down
prodigious retribution from the air.
</P>
<P>
   This would certainly not guarantee good behavior from Hussein.
It would, however, throw the responsibility for the suffering of
innocent Iraqis straight back at him.
</P>
<P>
   If, year in, year out, the U.N. were systematically killing
Iraqi children by air strikes, western governments would declare it
intolerable, no matter how noble the intention. They should find
their existing policy just as unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   In democracies, the end does not justify the means. &QL;

<P>
   Zimbabwe is in crisis. The blame lies almost entirely with
President Robert Mugabe and his ZANU-PF, the party that has ruled
the country since it gained independence from Britain in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The economic manifestations of this calamity are a worthless
currency, roaring inflation, burgeoning foreign debt, acute gas
shortages and fearsome unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Its political manifestations are peaceful demonstrations broken
up by violent thugs, the illegal occupation of more than 700
white-owned farms and an acrimonious dispute with Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in Zimbabwe's involvement in a pointless war in Congo and
the fact that a quarter of its people have AIDS, and it is easy to
see that the government has plenty to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to it, though, you would imagine that the top priority
is land reform. This is the issue that it is ruthlessly exploiting
in an effort to win next month's election.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something changes, disaster will surely ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Land-ownership is important in peasant societies, especially so
in Zimbabwe, where the pressure of an exploding population is
combined with a pattern of holdings not greatly changed from that
inherited at independence, and memories endure of the tracts that
were awarded by the colonial government to whites.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is no economic case for land reform _ Zimbabwe's
commercial farmers are efficient and produce most of its
foreign-exchange earnings _ the political argument is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, therefore, having botched Zimbabwe's birth, should help
out, so long as any reform is fair and carried out according to
legal principles. And, it should be said, so long as Zimbabwe is
run as a democracy in which the government respects the judiciary
and honors the results of free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   Here perhaps are the makings of a deal. The omens, however, are
not good.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has had 20 years in which to carry out land reform, yet
many of the white-owned farms secured for redistribution have gone
not to landless peasants but to government officials and the
president's cronies.
</P>
<P>
   In February, he went to the voters to seek permission to bring
in a new constitution, which would have allowed, among other
things, the government to seize (mainly white-owned) farms. The
voters rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, the government has resorted to occupations, which
it calls ``peaceful and legitimate demonstrations,'' despite one
killing this week.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations are also a way of attacking the opposition. By
intimidating the farmers _ almost all of whom, black or white, are
Zimbabweans _ the government's supporters hope to deny its
opponents a source of financial support.
</P>
<P>
   This is in character for a regime that has ruined a potentially
dynamic country by mismanagement and corruption. Mugabe and ZANU-PF
behave as if they own Zimbabwe. They make no distinction between
party and government.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has always swung between emotion and reason. Conceivably,
reason may regain the upper hand and he will allow the election to
be free and fair. But some nudging will almost certainly be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Britain can, improbably, extract a promise that he will
now stop harassing his opponents and honor the outcome of the poll.
If not, it will fall to South Africa, Zimbabwe's neighbor and
biggest trading partner, to try.
</P>
<P>
   If Mugabe were to steal the election, Zimbabwe would find itself
even more friendless at donors' conferences. That prospect must
cause alarm in South Africa: the last thing it needs is a
collapsing society on its doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   For Zimbabweans, it would be nothing short of a tragedy. &QL;

CHINA: GOLDEN ECONOMIC PRIZE, OR RISING MENACE?

<P>
   The West cannot quite make up its mind about how it wants to
deal with China. That French philosopher-king, Jacques Chirac,
sends poems each month to China's president, Jiang Zemin, who
responds with his own calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet defense planners in western capitals play their games on the
assumption that the next big war may be between American-led forces
and a rising China bent on trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In America, big business lobbies Congress to treat China as a
normal trading nation, while Congress urges the administration to
sell more weapons to Taiwan, as defense against Communist Chinese
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Golden economic prize or rising international menace? Is China
one or the other? Both or neither?
</P>
<P>
   If China is not the golden economic prize it is made out to be,
then the world at the very least risks wasting a fabulous amount of
money.
</P>
<P>
   If it is not really the rising international menace that Senator
Jesse Helms makes it out to be, then treating it as such could, at
worst, help turn it into one.
</P>
<P>
   At best, the West would lose what influence it may have had in
nudging China away from its many dissatisfactions and down more
democratic paths.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign interest in China's commercial promise typically follows
a roller-coaster course that starts in hope and ends in despair.
Hopes are rising again, with the prospect that China may be a
member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   This has long been the stuff of salesmen's dreams: 2.6 billion
armpits to deodorize.
</P>
<P>
   Added fervor comes from the Internet craze, with foreigners
falling over themselves to invest in Chinese dot.coms _ no matter
that government deems such investment illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Time to clear up a misunderstanding. China has never been the
prize that foreign businessmen have imagined _ foreigners earn an
average return on equity of just 3.3 percent _ and will not be for
a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the place is still miserably poor: average income per
person is less than $1,000 a year. Indeed, China probably should
not be buying many of the aircraft, power plants and capital goods,
not to mention the fighters, bombers and submarines, that outsiders
are selling it.
</P>
<P>
   Should the economy really take a tumble _ after an American
economic plunge, say, or a bout of self-inflicted regional
instability over Taiwan _ China would have trouble repaying loans.
Meanwhile, WTO membership will not mean a surge of foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
   Another misunderstanding, when the roller-coaster heads for
despair, is about the treatment of foreign companies in China. They
do not get a rawer deal than local ones. Rather, they are usually
sideswiped by restrictions that hit deserving domestic companies
harder.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, foreigners often have investment privileges denied to
locals. Yet it is these home-grown outfits that hold the key to the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The real significance of China's WTO membership is not as a
bonanza for foreigners, but as a rod for the forces of reform to
beat back a still stifling state and to build up the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese state will no doubt continue to resist. China's
membership of the WTO will assuredly place strains on that
organization, as the socialist legacy of protectionism clashes with
international trading rules.
</P>
<P>
   There are risks here for the West. But is the WTO so weak an
organization that the clash will mortally harm it?
</P>
<P>
   China's trade with the rest of the world is still smaller than
the Netherlands'. And, even realistically imagined, the potential
prize of admitting China is still worth having: a
continental-sized, more liberal economy that promotes regional
stability where now it lends instability.
</P>
<P>
   What of China as a rising international menace? China's armed
forces, though capable of regional mischief over Taiwan or disputed
claims in the South China Sea, are still far from being the
fighting machine its generals seem to want outsiders to believe.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways, China is slowly starting to conform to accepted
international practices. It has signed the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Under American pressure, it has started to curb military and
nuclear sales to unstable states, such as Iran and Pakistan. And it
takes part in regional talking clubs, albeit with a determination
to keep Taiwan either out or down.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that China wants its rightful place at the top
table of nations, and enjoys the back-slapping that comes with it.
Its leaders want economic prosperity too, since their rule rests
upon it, and membership of the WTO seems the only way to achieve
it.
</P>
<P>
   China may rant about American ``hegemony'' but, step by step, it
is surrendering to an international order that, while often
American-led, enjoys broad support.
</P>
<P>
   This is the levelheaded case for engaging China. But engagement
is not certain to transform it for the better. Capitalist economics
and communist politics cannot coexist forever: the risks of
instability will grow, as the demands for a liberalized economy
clash with an illiberal state.
</P>
<P>
   If China turns militaristic, even fascist, the West will have to
contain the threat that poses, as it has done before.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greater peril would be a collapse of central
authority under severe economic strain. Such an upheaval would not
necessarily bring democracy. It might intensify concerns about
weapons proliferation, illegal emigration and international crime.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the worry is about China's future strengths or
weaknesses, its uncertain future makes the pursuit of diplomacy
with it that much harder.
</P>
<P>
   Opting for illusion over reality, some western governments treat
China's weaknesses as strengths, overlooking the regime's disdain
for human rights and its intermittent bullying of its smaller
neighbors, in the hope of winning commercial favors from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Better to be clear about the international standards expected,
whether on trade, human rights or the use of force, and deal with
China on all fronts. For China is not a monolith. As it changes, so
the voices and interests that make up the country multiply. The
West would do well to engage them all. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sit down. Shut up,'' barks Rudolph Giuliani, shoving towards
an elderly man who has asked him if he has a bad temper.
</P>
<P>
   It is supposed to be a jokey tribute to Senator John McCain, who
has come to help the mayor on a campaign trip to Long Island to
boost his Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   During his presidential campaign, McCain had cleverly deflected
questions about his own bad temper by saying that they made him
``really mad.'' Done with McCain's sly chuckle, it worked a treat.
Done by Giuliani, it makes even a sympathetic Republican audience
jump before laughing.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when politicians seem able to ``emote'' anything,
Giuliani is a gloriously feeble actor. Assuming, that is, that
Hizzoner even bothers to try _ which he usually does not.
</P>
<P>
   Make a few sympathetic comments about unarmed men killed by
policemen? Not on your nelly. Accept New York's inconvenient city
charter? See you in court, Mister. Keep financing a museum that has
annoyed you? Fugeddabahdit. A few routine courtesies to your
opponent? Whodya think you are, lady?
</P>
<P>
   The boy who liked being the only Yankees' fan on a
Dodgers-ridden block in Brooklyn does not care.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's refusal to compromise _ particularly over the recent
shootings _ is widely seen as the reason why Hillary Rodham Clinton
has now drawn level in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton has weighed in with some talk about the
mayor being a reactionary; the word ``fascist'' is bandied around
Greenwich Village. Talk has resurfaced about Rick Lazio, a
conservative congressman, challenging Giuliani for the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Enlisting the support of McCain is a clever attempt to turn the
tide, on several levels. Although he lost New York's Republican
primary to George W. Bush (whom Giuliani endorsed), the Arizona
senator picked up plenty of Democratic support _ and Democrats
outnumber Republicans in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a reactionary, Giuliani belongs to the liberal
wing of his party; indeed, unlike McCain, he does not oppose
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper wisdom in bringing in McCain is that he is a glass
through which New York's skeptical voters can see Giuliani's
considerable virtues more clearly.
</P>
<P>
   According to this view, there are broadly speaking two sorts of
politician. The first, typified by the Clintons, takes an
ever-flexible ``feel your pain'' approach to issues, guided by
opinion polls rather than principle.
</P>
<P>
   The second, rarer, sort has strongly held opinions and speaks
them aloud, however unwelcome they may be to voters. Margaret
Thatcher comes to mind. So does McCain. And so does Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   If voters bothered to focus on anything so irrelevant as
achievements, then Giuliani should win by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   When he was elected mayor in 1993, New York City was veering
towards a state of ungovernability. Now its economy is booming and
crime has been cut to levels that once seemed unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   New York is now one of the safest large cities in America. Its
streets are cleaner and less cluttered with aggressive beggars.
Times Square has revived, and the sex shops and hookers have been
driven, if not out of business, at least to somewhere less visible.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of New York's schools, if not yet solved, is no
longer shrugged off.
</P>
<P>
   As with Mrs. Thatcher, another person famed neither for her
sense of humor nor for her compassion, there is a debate about how
much of this change is really Giuliani's doing.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors include a strong American economy, fewer young New
Yorkers on the streets and William Bratton, the mayor's innovative
first police commissioner. But without Giuliani's bloody-minded
leadership in the teeth of frequently intense opposition, the
change would have been nowhere near as dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   But do the talents that served him well in New York City now
equip him for the Senate?
</P>
<P>
   There is an understandable question-mark over Giuliani's ability
to work with others. Mrs. Clinton loses no opportunity to argue
that his ``autocratic style'' would be disastrous in Washington:
``My way or no way is not real leadership,'' she says (a comment a
lot of people around the White House will find particularly hard to
stomach).
</P>
<P>
   There are two responses to this. First, Giuliani is a better
diplomat than you might expect: he has hammered out deals _ albeit
grudging ones _ with unions, Democrats on the city council and even
his bete noire, the Republican governor, George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   But the second and stronger argument for Giuliani, made
forcefully by McCain, is that toughness is what the Senate needs:
he would have on America ``the same kind of profound effect as he
had on the city of New York,'' and would be a great ally for
campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we need tough guys around Washington, D.C., to get
tough jobs done, '' McCain said. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (225-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are all sorts of ways in which you can knock this idea. On
a personal level, a man who mistakes a sneer for an interview is
never going to have the rapport with the press that McCain had.
(When McCain christened Giuliani's battle-bus the ``Straight Talk
Junior Express,'' one hack quickly renamed it the ``Hate Talk
Express.'')
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, having accepted ``soft money,'' is also a flawed
advocate for campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   A few of his schemes _ such as a new baseball stadium for the
Yankees _ are mistaken. On international issues, Mrs. Clinton can
trounce a man who sometimes appears to think that foreign policy
means New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a fear that his role-models are bad ones: Britons
eventually tired of Margaret Thatcher's absolutism; McCain's attack
on the religious right was electorally insane.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if statesmanship means anything, it should be a refusal to
pander. Even on the issue of the police shootings, Giuliani has a
legitimate point (a multiracial jury recently acquitted four
policemen whom Mrs. Clinton had deemed to be murderers).
</P>
<P>
   That does not excuse the stunningly insensitive way in which the
mayor has generally advanced his case. But then, with Giuliani, the
content has usually been more meaningful than the delivery. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked to say what he thought Giuliani should do, McCain replied:
``Run on his record.''
</P>
<P>
   The race will turn on whether voters want somebody to feel their
pain, or to start changing things. In the meantime, sit down and
shut up: I'm talking to you, lady... &QL;

PHOENIX: THE NEXT SILICON VALLEY?

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX, ARIZ. _ To drive or fly across the mountains and
deserts of America's arid Southwest is to be reminded that the
earth is a planet. Their windswept grandeur seems to render the
human scale irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this baked, rocky land is attracting people faster than any
other part of America. Nevada and Arizona are the states with the
fastest-growing populations in America; Las Vegas and Phoenix are
its fastest-growing big cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ask say the clerks at USAA, an insurance firm that is building a
new operations center which will eventually employ 15,000 people to
the north of the city, why they are among the 60,000 people moving
into greater Phoenix each year.
</P>
<P>
   Those mountains figure large in Phoenicians' views of what makes
their city special. ``Quality of life,'' which they cite again and
again as the appeal of the city, means access to the pleasures of
the outdoors, by mountain bike, four-wheel-drive vehicle, or
snowboard.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining that quality of life, while continuing to attract
the firms that will provide the jobs to sustain population growth
at almost three times the national rate, is a balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since air-conditioning came in after the Second World War,
allowing the city's population to rise from 50,000 then to today's
2.95 million, Phoenix has steadily eaten its way across the floor
of the valley in which it sits.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mountains are sometimes dimmed by smog, and the roads
that lead to them are clogged with traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Things may come to a head in November with a ballot initiative,
put forward by the Sierra Club, an environmental group, to ban any
new building in a ring around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Worried, the state's governor, Jane Hull, and local businesses
have set up a ``growing smarter'' commission to tackle the issue of
sprawl. But the debate is increasingly turning to what sort of
businesses the city wants.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's core business has been property _ putting up buildings
and praying people and companies want to use them. Since the early
1990s, there has been a slightly more organized attempt to build
clusters _ first aerospace, then tourism and optics.
</P>
<P>
   But, somewhat inevitably, attention is focusing on the Internet.
In part this is just the desire of a slightly gauche place to
appear hip. But an industry that doesn't need too much space, and
brings in a lot of money and not too many people, also seems like a
good prospect for a city that wants to slow down a bit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Arizona Software and Internet Association, the
number of Internet jobs in the region is growing 13 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe, a Phoenix suburb that is home to Arizona State
University, a few trendy cafes and a new wireless network, is the
center. Drew Cohen brought his web firm, NeoPlanet, to Tempe from
Silicon Valley after his interest was excited by a local programmer
whom he wanted to hire, but who wouldn't leave. Cohen realized that
office space was half the cost of the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Is that enough? Alan Hald, another Tempe-based entrepreneur and
co-chairman of the Arizona Partnership for the New Economy, points
out that Phoenix lacks the venture capital that brings the whirr to
other high-tech hubs, such as Austin, Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Graunke, the chief executive of KnowledgeNet, boasts that 90
percent of his 250 staff are from around Phoenix; but he had to
bring his capital with him from Silicon Valley. Smart money in
Phoenix still tends to go into property deals.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is education. One Intel boss notes that Arizona
is a good place to build a new chip manufacturing plant, but the
technical skill available in the work force is not yet enough to
make it tempting to move Intel's design center out of California.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's universities are doing well, and its community
colleges, which provide two-year technical courses that are the
vital boost for lifting unskilled immigrants into higher job
brackets, are the country's best. Its schools, though, are weak.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has thrived because it has been for the rest of America
what America is for the world: a magnet for ambitious and restless
people.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has overcome weaknesses in its own education system by
using talent nurtured elsewhere. Although the average educational
level of native Arizonans is lower than in the country as a whole,
that of immigrants to the state is higher.
</P>
<P>
   But to keep attracting the ever more educated workers that the
new economy requires will mean maintaining that ``quality of life''
so prized by Phoenicians. That switches the debate back to the smog
and traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But another factor could be just as important for growing
smartly: character. Look at many of Phoenix's rivals, where there
is slightly more to do in the evening than listen to the
air-conditioning or discuss the next subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Dot.com people certainly seem to like mountain biking, but the
knowledge economy needs more than purely physical exertion. On the
other hand, there is no reason to give up hope. Downtown Phoenix is
getting a little jazzier. And nobody thought that Palo Alto was
that exciting 20 years ago. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   John McCain and Bill Bradley, who have both withdrawn from the
presidential race, garnered double-digit tallies in this week's
primaries in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Alan Keyes, who is still
running, got 10 percent of the vote in Wisconsin. &QL;

   &UR; DOUBLE-THINK OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said that ``all of us need to encourage people to
fill out the census'' before going on to say that he could
understand why some people ``don't want to give all that

I'm not sure I'd want to, either.'' (He got the short one.) &QL;

<P>
   &UR; ENDORSEMENT OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QL;

John McCain's environmental record, cited the tome when he
confessed his unexpected admiration for the vice president.
Meanwhile, Bush said that Gore ``is probably going to have to
explain what he meant by some of the things in his book.'' Bush for
one would be grateful for the explanation: he has not read the

<P>
   BOSTON _ Even in an age of negative politics, there is something
a little extraordinary, even admirable, about Jack E. Robinson
III's run for the Senate seat that comes up for election in
Massachusetts this year.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few candidates have slid downwards so quickly in popular
estimation. And none has fought a bad press in Robinson's
remarkable way: by first revealing even more of his own flaws, and
now demanding that his notoriously inhibited opponent does the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Few local Republicans wanted to challenge Ted Kennedy's 38 years
in office and his $3.6 million war chest. So, when Robinson
appeared out of nowhere in March, the party adopted him quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A black conservative whose father ranked high in the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Robinson
holds degrees from Harvard and Brown Universities, worked as an
airline executive and had $1 million of his own to spend. He looked
fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor, Paul Cellucci, swiftly endorsed him.
Then came the accusations. In 1985, policemen found a martial-arts
weapon in Robinson's jacket pocket; he says a stranger must have
put it there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a federal judge said he had violated copyright laws in
a book; Robinson says he only meant to add historical context.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 restraining order, a former girlfriend alleged that he
had forced her to have sex. And another woman told the Boston Globe
that on a 1996 date he lathered her with so many unwanted kisses
that she called him ``Jack the Tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   He denied both stories. Then Robinson issued the highly unusual
nine-page document he calls the ``Robinson Report.'' In
conversational prose, it outlines every skeleton remaining in his
closet, along with explanations, defenses and apologies.
</P>
<P>
   Headings include ``Motor Vehicle Incident 1,'' ``Motor Vehicle
Incident 2,'' ``Copyright Case'' and ``Bar Exam.'' (He failed it
twice in New York and Texas, he concedes. ``But then again, I
didn't really study for them either.'')
</P>
<P>
   Robinson says he started preparing the report months before he
announced his candidacy, so that he could get the unpleasant side
of things out of the way before diving into the real issues. But,
by the time it was released, there was so much talk of sin that
nobody was interested in substance.
</P>
<P>
   Things did not improve when Robinson got into yet another car
accident, and was accused of trying to escape from the scene.
``Boy, everything is happening to me,'' he said. ``Cellucci is
withdrawing his support, and people are sliding across the highway
at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Robinson has replaced self-pity and openness with defiance
and (by his standards) secrecy. He is even more intent on running
now, he says, so that he can change the way campaigns operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've gone through the last two weeks, nobody else should
have to go through,'' he says. ``I don't think it should be the
goal to tear down the other opponent, or to hold up the opponent
for ridicule.''
</P>
<P>
   He intends to stay clear of Kennedy's (arguably far greater)
personal failings _ but he is not going to discuss his own problems
until the senator is willing to do the same. ``No more double
standards, no more unilateral disarmament,'' he announced on April
3.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has a point. Even the parts of the local press that are
not slavishly loyal to Kennedy have long since given up asking him
about Chappaquiddick, where that young lady drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Venting their frustration on Robinson has been cheap and easy.
It would be sad if a politician got punished for telling more than
he needed to tell.
</P>
<P>
   We wish Robinson well _ though he should probably let somebody
else drive. &QL;

JAPAN NEEDS A NEW PRIME MINISTER WITH A MANDATE, SOON

<TEXT>
<P>
   The departure of the head of government in most countries is
quite an event: it raises the possibility of change. Not in Japan,
though.
</P>
<P>
   After Keizo Obuchi's stroke last weekend, Japan has had to find
a new prime minister. No one, however, seems to be looking for any
other change; that, most Japanese seem to think, can wait until
after the general election, due sometime before the autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new man may only serve as a stopgap. Then a
permanent replacement for Obuchi can be found, it is said, and he
can ponder some changes.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Japan cannot afford to be so relaxed. Not that Obuchi has
been a failure. On the contrary, although he once described himself
as ``very, very ordinary,'' he has done much to end Japan's worst
postwar recession.
</P>
<P>
   He had staked his reputation on delivering economic growth of at
least 0.6 percent for the financial year that ended in March and it
looks as though the official figures, when they are published in
the summer, will show he has achieved it.
</P>
<P>
   Growth of 0.6 percent may seem modest, but Japan is often like a
supertanker with the tiller locked. A change of course can be
achieved only with immense effort: indeed, if Obuchi has got any
growth at all, it will have taken a staggering Yen35 trillion ($325
billion) in public spending to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Japan cannot afford to go on running its economy
this way. A new leader is required, who could act to unleash the
country's enterprise and restore the confidence of its consumers.
And he should waste no time in securing a mandate from the voters
for the changes that are needed.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not seem to be the way that minds have been
working in the upper echelons of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's successor is to be Yoshiro Mori, the LDP's
secretary-general, an archetypal politician of the old school. No
one expects him to last beyond the election.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that some people in the LDP may be thinking of
bringing the election forward. Obuchi wanted it in the early
autumn, because it would then follow better economic news and all
the publicity that will attend the prime minister's role at the G8
meeting of the rich world's leaders, plus Russia, in Okinawa in
July.
</P>
<P>
   But some LDP leaders, worried about the party's dwindling
support and hoping no doubt for a sympathy vote, want the election
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   They are right, albeit for the wrong reasons. An early poll
would be good for Japan. Whatever the result, it would provide a
new government with a new term of office, instead of an interim one
muddling along for six months of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Muddling along is often the way of consensus-style government in
Japan. It may not always lead to disaster, but at present there is
work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Urgent economic issues and preparations for the summit are high
on the agenda. Mount Usu, a volcano on the island of Hokkaido, is
rumbling.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the aftermath of the political eruption caused
by Obuchi's rejection of the latest in a series of demands from one
of his coalition partners, Ichiro Ozawa, the Liberal leader. Ozawa
was forced out as a result, although some members of his party have
remained in the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In most other countries such events in a leaderless vacuum might
amount to a crisis. Not in Japan: the stock market hit its highest
level of the year this week and the yen rose.
</P>
<P>
   That was because Japan is so insulated against change that
everyone knows things will go on as expected: the legislative
agenda is already in place for the rest of the current session of
the Diet (parliament) and the important budget and tax-reform bills
have already been passed.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that not much is likely to happen about Japan's
long-postponed reforms either. With an election looming, there is
already pressure to ease off anything that might upset voters.
</P>
<P>
   Several advisory commissions appointed by Obuchi may never
report. They have been looking into new ideas about how to reform
all sorts of things, from the Diet to education, welfare and the
police.
</P>
<P>
   All of which adds up to one word: delay. The politicians will
keep up their factional infighting while the bureaucracy continues
to set policy.
</P>
<P>
   The real transition from such feudal ways may have to await
another generation. Unfortunately, that may also be the generation
that inherits all the problems being dodged today: the consequences
of a greying society, banks burdened with debts, companies
unrestructured and a public sector deep in deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing Japan then will not be a job for a Mr. Ordinary. The time
to get on with it is now. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR _ Will El Salvador be the next Latin American
country to adopt the dollar as its currency?
</P>
<P>
   Its conservative governments have long been enthusiastic about a
currency switch. Jose Luis Trigueros, the finance minister, argues
that dollarization would boost economic growth, by eliminating
currency risk and thus allowing interest rates to fall.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say dollarization would help a small group of
bankers, while hurting manufacturers and exporters.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, El Salvador is a far more promising
candidate for dollarization than, say, Ecuador, which recently
adopted the greenback out of desperation with its own, sliding,
currency.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, El Salvador has maintained a fixed exchange rate
for a decade. It has enough hard-currency reserves to replace the
local currency. And its economic ties with the United States have
long been close.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does its giant neighbor take 60 percent of El
Salvador's exports, but the largest single source of hard currency
is the $1.3 billion sent home annually by Salvadoreans who live
there.
</P>
<P>
   After a promising spurt in the mid-1990s, El Salvador's economic
growth rate has since sagged. Farmers and manufacturers are
struggling. But, until recently, bankers have been thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Although prices fell last year, bank lending rates are running
at a stiff 15-22 percent. Such rates have encouraged El Salvador's
banks to borrow abroad, lending the funds on in local currency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now the bonanza threatens to stop. The banks' profits are
falling, and their clients are struggling to pay their debts. The
strongest five banks are now buying up the rest, and expanding
their business into other Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
   The economic slowdown has led to calls to float the exchange
rate. That is favored by exporters, including the clothing
factories which set up in El Salvador a decade ago, attracted by
tax breaks. They face stiff competition from similar maquiladora
factories in Mexico and elsewhere in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Dollarization is also opposed by the FMLN, the left-wing party
set up by former guerrillas. It made gains in a parliamentary
election last month, displacing the governing right-wing ARENA as
the largest party in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But devaluation would be costly for the banks, whose
hard-currency debts now stand at $500 million. To their critics,
the banks have enjoyed undue privileges. Though they are free to
set interest rates, competition is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign banks have been allowed unfettered access to El Salvador
only since last year. The banks charge high fees for processing
remittances, and pay a paltry 3-4 percent on most savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the banks were privatized at the end of El Salvador's
civil war of the 1980s. They were supposed to be sold to their
employees and the public, but in practice ended up in the hands of
a small group of the country's richest families, members of ARENA.
</P>
<P>
   The banks' close links with the authorities were underlined last
year when the central bank's president of more than a decade left
his post and soon joined the largest private bank.
</P>
<P>
   If it is to revive the economy, the government may have to
decide either to dollarize or to devalue. If it chooses the dollar,
the banks' record means that its decision may be unpopular, at
least among El Salvador's producers. &QL;

<P>
   SIALKOT, PAKISTAN _ Were it not for Indian guns that sometimes
fire shells into villages near the Kashmir border, the Sialkot
district would be one of Pakistan's most desirable. Unemployment is
low, literacy high and people are rich: income per head is about
$1,000, nearly twice the national average.
</P>
<P>
   In a country known for exporting cheap textiles and expensive
narcotics, Sialkot prospers by making musical and surgical
instruments, leather goods and, above all, sporting equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Daska Road is the heart of the world's soccer-ball industry. In
the mid-1990s, Sialkot's soccer-ball magnates were under attack. It
was then that the western press discovered that they were employing
children and threatened to bury them in a landslide of bad
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of preparation could have lessened the shock and
revulsion I felt on entering a sporting-goods factory in the town
of Sialkot,'' wrote one journalist, who in 1996 described children
toiling 80 hours a week to make soccer balls in near darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The industry hastily made changes. In February 1997 Sialkot's
chamber of commerce signed the ``Atlanta Agreement,'' under which
manufacturers volunteered to stop child labor and let international
monitors check up on them. Various agencies teamed up to shepherd
the liberated youngsters into schools.
</P>
<P>
   Three years on, child labor in Sialkot's soccer industry is
mostly history. The chamber of commerce says that 66 manufacturers,
representing 90 percent of the district's exports, have submitted
to inspection by the International Labour Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Child Employed is a Future Destroyed'' reads a sticker
pasted up at the chamber of commerce building, and manufacturers
seem to believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Even where the ILO is not monitoring, says Amena Hasan, project
manager for Save the Children, a charity, there is ``almost zero
child labor.'' That has meant changes far beyond replacing little
hands with big ones, and not all of them for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Atlanta Agreement, making soccer balls was largely a
cottage industry. Much of the work _ cutting and printing laminates
that make the shell of the ball _ was done in factories, but
stitching, the most labor-intensive process, was usually outsourced
to families in villages around Sialkot.
</P>
<P>
   Families could earn about 25 rupees (50 cents) for each ball.
But the ILO cannot inspect every house. So manufacturers have had
to shift stitching into centers _ often, little more than sheds on
a rutted village road _ that the ILO's 14 monitors know about and
can visit at will. Pay is still by the piece, but the industry's
informal character is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The effects have been double-edged. Almost all firms have seen
costs go up. Capital Sports, a biggish manufacturer, has invested
some 3.6 million rupees ($67,000) to build three stitching centers.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, extra expenses, such as transporting workers to
and from the centers, have raised the cost of stitching one ball
from 25 rupees to 40 rupees or more, reckons the firm's boss,
Khawaja Zakauddin. Other firms say their costs have risen more.
</P>
<P>
   That adds relatively little to the cost of making top-quality
balls, which manufacturers sell to brand-name companies such as
Adidas and Puma for $10 or so. But at the low end of the market,
which includes $2 ``promotional'' (free publicity) balls, the extra
costs hurt.
</P>
<P>
   This is where competitors such as China, which makes
machine-stitched balls, and India have gained ground at Sialkot's
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's share of the American soccer-ball market by volume
dropped from 65 percent to 45 percent between 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Machine stitching is becoming good enough to produce
better-quality balls, threatening Pakistan's industry at its
strongest point.
</P>
<P>
   Many manufacturers are being squeezed between higher costs and
penny-pinching customers. Zia Urrahman Choudhry, chief executive of
Fox &AMP; Associates, a medium-sized manufacturer, says buyers of his
promotional balls want certification of their adult-only
workmanship but are unwilling to pay extra for it.
</P>
<P>
   Capital Sports has resisted pressure from customers to cut
prices, and seen sales drop from more than 1 million balls in 1998,
a World Cup year, to 400,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Agreement has been a spur as well as a brake,
helping some manufacturers become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Because kits are now distributed to fewer centers and every ball
is coded (so that inspectors can trace strays), manufacturers have
better control of production.
</P>
<P>
   Before Atlanta, Fox got information once a week on which balls
were in which stages of production; now it comes every second day.
That has enabled it to reduce its stocks. Its record of on-time
delivery to customers has improved from 50 percent to 70-80
percent. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 250 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest manufacturers seem to revel in the child-free
regime. Saga Sports, which makes 4 million-5 million balls a year
for Nike and other brands, pampers its 9,000 employees and their
families with free medical care and subsidized shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Its lavish Daska Road headquarters, Saga City, has a tiny
football ground and a giant one for cricket, which is far more
popular. Although part-timers help out during peak periods, the
bulk of Saga's stitching is done by full-timers, paid a salary
rather than by the piece.
</P>

   High fixed costs should be a handicap in an industry with sharp
fluctuations in demand, but Saga is unworried. It reckons that its
big stitching centers have the double virtue of impressing
ethically-anxious customers and ensuring quality.
</P>
<P>
   Saga's Faiz Shah says that it has cut by half the time needed to
produce a ball. Saga's research and development laboratory invents
new designs and materials, helping to keep prices up.
</P>
<P>
   Saga barely noticed last year's slump in demand. Saga has
nonetheless started a (child-free) operation in China to take
advantage of better transport.

<P>
   The fate of other firms depends on a host of factors besides
child labor, from the level of world demand to the strength of the
rupee.

   India's recent move to a monitoring program may raise
competitors' costs, though too late for some firms. According to
the local chamber of commerce, some of the smallest producers have
already gone out of business. &QL;

   Has all this upheaval made Sialkoters better off? Maybe. Some
6,000 children are in schools run by ``partner'' charities in the
Atlanta program; local state schools are being upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   But many families have paid a high price. Many have lost the
wages not only of their children but of their women, who are
constrained by custom and religion from working at stitching
centers. Though some people are stitching more regularly in the
centers, overall family incomes have fallen by roughly 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who thinks of child labor as an unmitigated evil, this
price looks worth paying. Others are less categorical.
</P>
<P>
   Save the Children, which supports Atlanta, makes a distinction
between child labor and ``child work,'' which can give children
income, skills and self-confidence without damaging their
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   In the soccer-ball industry, two-thirds of child workers were
part-timers working at home, and 80-90 percent of those went to
school, says Save the Children's Hasan.
</P>
<P>
   The satanic conditions described by shocked journalists are far
more prevalent in hazardous industries like brick-making and
surgical instruments. &QL;

   Even the pillars of Atlanta agree that the soccer-ball
industry's glamour, more than its sins, made it the target of
reformers, and that reform ``started in a rush,'' as Jacques van
der Pols, the ILO's chief technical adviser in Sialkot, puts it.
</P>
<P>
   They are correcting their earlier mistakes. To lure women back
into the work force, the ILO now monitors mini-centers where as few
as three women work, restoring some of the industry's cottage
character. Another group makes small-business loans to affected
families. &QL;

<P>
   Atlanta supporters argue that the program's main benefit will be
to serve as a ``gateway'' to improving conditions in lower-profile,
more hazardous industries throughout Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   A move is afoot to extend monitoring to all industries in
Sialkot. The ILO would also like stitching centers to introduce a
minimum wage and amenities such as toilets.
</P>
<P>
   The big firms, many of which have already upgraded their
facilities, will welcome higher standards. Harder-pressed firms
will resist.
</P>
<P>
   Like soccer itself, getting rid of child labor is not a win-win
game. &QL;

<P>
   Who has not banged out an angry reply to an apparently brusque
e-mail message, hit the send button _ and then regretted it?
</P>
<P>
   Surely no technology has led to so many rifts and fractured
friendships (not to mention subpoenas) as electronic mail. But
nowhere is e-mail more perilous than in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments by Michael Morris, an academic at Stanford Business
School, and a group of colleagues have now demonstrated what many
people instinctively suspect: negotiations are more likely to go
well if they are conducted, at least in part, face to face, rather
than between strangers armed with keyboards and screens.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is not invariably a bad way to negotiate, but the
research suggests that it needs to be used carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Leigh Thompson of the Kellogg Graduate Business
School at Northwestern University, and several other academics,
Morris studied mock negotiations that used only e-mail and compared
them with ones preceded by a brief getting-to-know-you telephone
call.
</P>
<P>
   The second type went more smoothly. Other experiments found that
electronic negotiations were easier when the negotiators began by
swapping photographs and personal details; or when they already
knew each other.
</P>
<P>
   Why is e-mail such a snare? Heidi Roizen, a Silicon Valley
veteran who now works for Softbank Venture Capital, thinks that
part of the problem is that ``most people are lousy typists _ and
they don't think about the fact that an e-mail lasts forever.''
</P>
<P>
   She has two rare advantages: she is an English major, and a
90-words-a-minute typist. She finds the durability of e-mail is one
of its main advantages _ it allows her to keep track of her
dealings with the eight different companies on whose boards she
sits: ``It's instant record-keeping.''
</P>
<P>
   But she scrupulously follows two rules to avoid
misunderstanding: ``Re-read each piece of mail before you send it,
from the point of view of the recipient; and when in doubt, leave
it overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   As every Victorian letter-writer learned, a night's sleep is the
best filter to apply to a furious note.
</P>
<P>
   John Kay, a British economist, goes further. After having to
calm a succession of weeping secretaries, he instituted a rule at
London Economics, a consultancy that he founded, that e-mails
should contain only information and never emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite its pitfalls, e-mail is increasingly likely to be
used for negotiation. Richard Hill, an IT manager and mediator with
Hill &AMP; Associates in Geneva, worked with the University of
Massachusetts on the establishment of an electronic mediation
service called the Online Ombuds Office.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that mediation by telephone is generally simpler and
faster: a three-minute telephone call contains far more information
than a typical brisk e-mail. But, because online mediation can be
done at a time that is convenient for the parties involved, it
tends to be less costly.
</P>
<P>
   Just think a moment before you hit that send button, though. &QL;

THE KU KLUX KLAN: STILL RIDING, WITH A BIGGER AGENDA

<P>
   FORREST CITY, ARK. _ More than a century after their
organization was founded, members of the Ku Klux Klan still gather
on Saturday afternoons in various parts of the South, preaching
their message of white pride.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing white robes and hoods, a small group of men stand on an
abandoned parking lot near the St. Francis County Courthouse here
in Forrest City, screaming out their view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Only a railway track and a collection of policemen with guns on
their hips separate them from their target, a group of blacks who
hurl back counter-abuse. A few, having used particularly strong
language, are taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   As one sheriff's deputy says of the Klan's rally, it's like
waving a red flag in front of a bull.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow deputies, along with local and state policemen,
outnumber the watching journalists. A few men in overalls sit on a
wooden bench on the lawn of the courthouse, listening to the Klan's
rambling message.
</P>
<P>
   A woman and her two children walk as close as they can to the
Klansmen, until the police tell them that they cannot cross an
imaginary line which segregates the Klan from the rest of the
townsfolk. The woman snaps a photograph before turning away.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, mouths agape, hold their children's hands and try to
explain the purpose of these men in robes. Many are angry that such
a thing is allowed in Forrest City.
</P>
<P>
   What few of them realize is that the founders of Forrest City, a
small, poor farming town most of whose people are now blacks, named
it in honor of Nathan Bedford Forrest, the father of the Ku Klux
Klan.
</P>
<P>
   That was back in the late 19th century, when the Klan was trying
to reassert the identity of the South after its defeat in the Civil
War of 1861-65. Perhaps those who demonstrate against the
Confederate flag that still flutters across the South should also
protest about the name of this east Arkansas town.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century or so ago, the Klan was remembered for its
nocturnal cross burnings, its bombing of black churches, its
occasional murders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a new century, it has picked up the trappings of
modernity. It has an Internet address for the ``Invisible Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   It puts out propaganda against the return of Elian Gonzalez to
Cuba, and a rich selection of attacks on the government, as well as
the racialism it spouts through bullhorns. It leaves its rallies in
minibuses, not on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Chester Quarles, a professor at the University of Mississippi,
says the Klan has transformed itself in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, its national headquarters is in Harrison, up in the
Ozark Mountains, a part of Arkansas from which blacks vanished
almost entirely in the early 1900s, and to which few have returned.
</P>
<P>
   But Klansmen, he says, are no longer transfixed by the single
issue of race. They have also enlisted themselves in the campaign
against powerful government, especially the government in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   They are flexible in their operations: one weekend a member may
wear the hood of a Klansman, the next the insignia of the (equally
racialist) Aryan Nations. Or, quite often, they will gather for a
``meet and eat'' potluck meal, to chat about politics and religion
on a Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   If you knew the addresses of Klansmen, Quarles reckons, you
would find quite a few who are the neighbors of liberal
suburbanites.
</P>
<P>
   The Klan says that its aim is to build a ``nationwide
grass-roots movement of white Christian men, women and children who
support a return of white Christians to government.''
</P>
<P>
   Its platform is not unlike that of far-right Christian
conservatives _ an insistence that America was founded as a
Christian nation, a call for America's withdrawal from the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the military sealing of America's borders
against illegal immigrants, the end of anti-gun laws, drug tests
for people on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   It has even embraced environmentalism, supporting events like
Earth Day by sending out its unwanted troops to clean up litter and
so on.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as the Klan extends its agenda, it still evokes
deep-seated images of midnight rides and the shouting of hatred.
</P>
<P>
   The Klansmen at the rally in Forrest City said that they just
wanted to exercise their First Amendment right, to say what they
thought about immigration, taxes _ and keeping minorities in their
place.
</P>
<P>
   They did so for more than an hour. Then, after putting their
Confederate flags and white hoods in their vans, they drove away.
Blacks jotted down license-plate numbers on scraps of paper.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon air felt sultrier than ever, and the policeman
said a long night loomed ahead. &QL;

   NAPLES _ Seeing how much we know about Roman licentiousness, it
is not surprising that a great deal of erotic material was found in
the patrician villas, taverns, baths and brothels of the cities of
Pompeii and Herculaneum, where life stopped at lunchtime on a hot
August day in 79 AD as Vesuvius exploded and buried them under
ashes and volcanic rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half centuries after the Bourbon kings ordered the dig
which brought the cities to light, a collection of those ``obscene
objects,'' long kept behind closed doors, is about to be opened
again to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bourbon restoration in 1815 they were among the works
in the new museum opened in the grounds of the royal palace at
Portici on the outskirts of Naples.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Duke of Calabria, the future Francis I, took his
wife and young daughter to see the collection, he was shocked by
what was put before the ladies' eyes and decided that henceforth
the objects considered obscene would be kept under lock in il
Gabinetto segreto (generally known as ``the secret rooms'').
</P>
<P>
   Only privileged persons were to be admitted. Even Stendhal and
Donizetti had to make written applications.
</P>
<P>
   During the prudish but revolutionary 19th century, access was a
token of either status or liberty. Not surprisingly, Garibaldi had
the doors thrown open when he arrived in post-Bourbon Naples but
they were soon closed again when a new period of puritanism set in.
</P>
<P>
   During the 20th century access has been subject to various
vicissitudes, again according to the degrees of permissiveness in
vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was reopened after the Second World War, the
Gabinetto, which is housed in the National Archeological Museum in
Naples, has been closed since 1971, ostensibly for restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms have now been restored and when the new display is
ready, hopefully before Easter (though this is still to be
confirmed), they will be open to groups of 20 at a time with no
extra charge on the entrance ticket.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no official inauguration (it is Holy Year after
all), nor any restrictions on children and teenagers whose entry
will be left to the discretion of their parents or teachers.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of the ``obscene'' objects reveals more than anything
that they are far above the standards _ as art as well as
entertainment _ of what passes for porn nowadays. &QL;

   Erotica here followed the taste of the Greek traditions, even if
there is surprisingly little Attic pottery in Naples though plenty
in other museums of Magna Graecia.
</P>
<P>
   The first myth to be debunked is that Pompeii was a sister city
to Sodom and Gommorah. Among the sophisticated classes but also
among the less affluent and even among slaves, excess was the only
reproach made in sexual matters. &QL;

<P>
   In important provincial cities like Pompeii, sexual promiscuity
was normal but, as these objects reveal, discreetly organized.
Certainly the women depicted in the orgies were real prostitutes
not the ladies of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The phallus is the object most on display; in marble, stone and
bronze, with all its uses, both practical and allegorical.
</P>
<P>
   In the prudish centuries the moral castigators preached that
Pompeii must indeed have been a most immoral city because the
phallus was everywhere. Yet, as in most of the ancient world it was
a propitious symbol; a talisman rather than a dirty joke.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of Priapus, its erect form greeted the visitor at
the entrance to the home, the tavern or the bakery. It was the
handle on which bells were hung which would be rattled to scare
away evil spirits.
</P>
<P>
   It not only provided the outlet from which the water sprouted
from the statue in the villa's garden but could even be found, in
more miniature form, inside bowls from which you drank your water
or wine at table.
</P>
<P>
   There is an intriguing lamp in which a gladiator is locked in
combat with his phallus which has been transformed into a ferocious
beast. As for other interpretations of the practical uses of the
phallus in Ancient Rome, the Gabinetto tells us much about sexual
mores.
</P>
<P>
   According to Antonio Varone, an archaeologist and author of
``Eroticism in Pompeii,'' there is evidence of striptease and of
the equivalent of porn films, with slaves performing erotic scenes
as an ancient Viagra substitute. &QL;

   Some items will inevitably prompt giggles, such as the
classic-style marble statue from Herculaneum of ``Pan and the
Goat'' _ which was probably always meant to amuse, judging by the
knowing smirks exchanged between the languorous goat and its
seducer.
</P>
<P>
   In another statue, also clearly of Greek origin, a mature Pan is
teaching a youthful Daphni (male version of Daphne) to play the
flute in a clear sexual metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   Ovid and Martial, among others, always taught that the Romans,
even if coarser than the Greeks, knew a lot about the Ars amatoria.
The aura of scandal which has surrounded for so long these
illustrations of how they performed will now perhaps diminish. &QL;

   It is ironic, as the museum's director, Professor Stefano De
Caro, explained recently while guiding visitors around the
Gabinetto, that over the centuries most European courts, when
embarrassed by objects they considered obscene in their
collections, would consign them to Naples. To them, the Gabinetto
was evidently considered a depository of pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the museums in the world have their own secret rooms _
probably even the Vatican. Perhaps it is time to open all the
doors. Naples is setting an example. &QL;

JAPAN RETHINKING PLANS TO OPEN BANKING INDUSTRY TO NON-BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Plans to allow non-banks to enter the banking business
here are faltering.
</P>
<P>
   Hideyuki Aizawa, an influential politician who heads the ruling
party's Financial Issues Research Committee, is urging financial
regulators to reconsider plans to issue banking licenses to
companies like Sony Corp. and the retailer Ito-Yokado, saying the
banking laws need to be redrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that the regulators should not consider this
issue too lightly,'' Aizawa said in a telephone interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that laws in the United States prohibit non-financial
companies from operating banks. ``Usually the regulators here
always say, `It's done in the U.S., it's done in the U.S,' but in
this case, it is not done in the U.S.,'' Aizawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been eagerly anticipating the entrance of new
players into the banking business here in hopes that they would
shake up the staid, clubby world of Japanese banking and bring some
competitiveness to the market. Sony intends to build a bank online,
while Ito-Yokadohas been preparing to add a bank to the many other
services its 7-Eleven convenience store affiliate provides.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate is becoming increasingly politicized. Elections
are looming, and the small- and mid-sized regional banks that might
suffer the most from the competition of Internet banking and other
new entrants are among the most loyal supporters of politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Michio Ochi, the former head of the body that is overseeing the
restructuring of the banking industry here, the Financial
Reconstruction Commission, lost his job for essentially admitting
this relationship. Ochi had suggested that he would intervene on
behalf of bankers if they thought his inspectors were too harsh.
The opposition seized on Ochi's remarks as proof that the ruling
party favors bankers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The brief scandal over Ochi's slip-up has been widely cited as
contributing to the cause of the stroke that felled former Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi earlier this month. Obuchi is hospitalized
and fighting for his life.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Aizawa has worked to raise legitimate questions about allowing
corporations to run banking businesses, and some analysts agree
that the regulators may need to give the subject greater
consideration. ``The point is that the standards have to be
clear,'' said Setsuko Akiba, a banking analyst at Deutsche
Securities in Tokyo. ``Without standards, it is premature to
discuss whether the entry of new players like Sony and Ito-Yokado
is appropriate or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Aizawa and others question whether it is fair to allow other
companies to enter the banking business while circumscribing the
ability of banks to invest in other businesses. ``If we are to
approve the advance of other businesses into banking, then we have
to allow banks to advance into other businesses,'' Aizawa said.
``Unless we do so, we are not establishing equal footing for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he expressed concerns about the government's
responsibilities if a bank controlled by a corporation should
encounter financial difficulties.``The Japanese government has put
trillions of yen into Japanese banks already to shore them up, so
if similar problems occur in banks set up by businesses outside the
banking field, similar obligations could arise,'' he said. ``So our
position is to require the regulators to be very careful about this
issue.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To some extent, though, the regulators have already sanctified
non-bank ownership of banks. In February, the Financial
Reconstruction Commission gave a consortium led by Softbank Corp.
the exclusive right to negotiate to buy the failed Nippon Credit
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Although some banks are expected to participate in the
consortium, Softbank, one of the world's largest Internet
incubators, and Orix Corp., a leasing company, lead the group and
would hold the biggest stakes in Nippon Credit Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Softbank's credit is rated ``speculative'' by
Moody's Investors Service, while both Sony and Ito-Yokado enjoy
very high credit ratings. Questions have been raised about how
regulators can refuse to grant Sony and Ito-Yokado a banking
license if an existing bank is being sold to Softbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there are a group of companies bidding for Nippon Credit
Bank, so it's a little different,'' Aizawa said, although he noted
that many people were raising that question.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have already tried to block the Softbank bid, citing
as yet unspecified conflicts of interest relating to its adviser,
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. Goldman, Sachs advised the government on its
sale of the Long-Term Credit Bank, another failed bank, to a group

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, April 11:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASTEROIDS (Undated) _ Taking cautious, baby steps, a
spacecraft called NEAR Shoemaker is to settle Monday into a closer
orbit of an asteroid it has been circling for almost two months.
Guided by gentle shoves from small thruster rockets, the robotic
craft is taking up a circular orbit 62-miles from the center of
Eros for more detailed studies. After spending about 11 days at
this altitude, the craft is to take another downstep on its way to
settling in at a height of 31 miles for months of closeup
observations of the pitted, tumbling, rocky mass below. By Warren
E. Leary.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FRUIT-FLY (Undated) _ The Drosophila fruit fly, whose genome
was just decoded, has attained vast prominence in human affairs
because it is one of the principal model organisms studied by
biologists as a means of understanding the general design of life.
Because of the unity of evolution, the fly's genes and those of
people overlap considerably. Their advocates, who call themselves
fly people, are easily provoked into confessing that they think of
people as large flies that lack wings. And over the past 93 years,
the fly has a long and celebrated history in biology and genetics.
By Nichols Wade. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEPATITIS-C (Washington) _ The discovery of 50-year-old Army
blood samples in helping scientists determine what the best course
of treatment may be for hepatitis C. Now, some contend that
aggressive treatment, which can be painful and cause side effects,
should be used in almost all cases. Other say that the odds of
contracting symptoms of the disease are small and the more moderate
approaches are called for. By Gina Kolata. (1950 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT1.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VA-ARCHEO (Philadelphia) _ With new evidence, archaeologists
have more firmly dated a site in Virginia at 15,900 years, making
it much earlier than sites found on the West Coast and raising the
possibility that first human occupation sites were on East Coast.
It also gives further credence for placing human in the Western
Hemisphere earlier than previously thought. By John Noble Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BIG-ICEBERGS (Undated) _ Two mammoth icebergs have broken
off the Antarctic ice cap in the past several weeks, including one
that is the largest in more than four decades. By Henry Fountain.
(300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GORILLA-TECH (Undated) _ Since Dr. Dian Fossey began
studying the mountain gorillas of Rwanda and adjoining countries in
the 1960s, researchers have tracked, with some interruptions, the
fortunes of these engaging creatures in a perpetually endangered
jungle. Now, a collaboration of several American and Rwandan
institutions is taking that program to the edge of high technology,
using remote sensing from satellites and aircraft and electronic
trackers on the ground to create a vastly expanded, instantly
accessible record of the gorillas and their habitat in digital
form. By James Glanz. (1325 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT2, and a map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VAROS (Washington) _ Remedios Varo, considered one of the
greatest surrealist painters of the 20th century, is at last
beginning to receive international acclaim, including the
admiration of a cadre not always known for its art house savvy: the
scientific community. In a recent symposium, an expert described
how the artist metaphorically conveyed some of the most
revolutionary and complex scientific theories of the age, from
Einstein's special theory of relativity and Darwin's theory of
evolution by natural selection to the premise that humans are the
stuff of stars. By Natalie Angier (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photos, NYT3,4.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on the
tail of Comet Hyakutake (it's 330 million miles long), e. coli
contamination in cow manure and ways to kill it, and the thornback
ray's method of purging its stomach. By Henry Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEART-DIET (Undated) _ Medicare is now undertaking a radical
diet experiment in several centers to determine if critically ill
heart patients can become better by radically altering their diets
and their daily routines under the Dean Ornisch diet. They hope to
determine if they can cut costs for heart procedures through
preventive steps. They also should reveal on a large scale just how
effective the diet, which has its critics, really is. By Barbara
Whitaker. (1725 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BROCKOVITCH-SCIENCE (Undated) _ Reflections column. Many
scientists are offended by the movie ``Erin Brockovitch.'' The
problem, they say, is not that they cannot enjoy a good yarn in
which virtue triumphs over evil and the little guys win. It is a
more subtle: while it is easy to see that the sex and even the
violence in movies are fantasies, it is hard for any but scientists
to discern when science in movies crosses the line from verity to
hyperbole and indoctrination. The end result, some say, is to help
perpetuate misconceptions about scientific evidence and about the
risks of everyday life. By Gina Kolata. (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: With
the arrival of spring, allergies are not necessarily inevitable.
Many drugs, old and new, are on the market now and have proved to
be highly effective. Some are grossly underused. By Jane E. Brody.
(1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILDREN-ALONE (Undated) _ Twelve to 14 percent of American
children ages 5 to 12 spend some time home alone after school, a
new study has found, but the period without adult supervision
averages only an hour, most of the children are older, and many
seem to welcome a measure of privacy and independence. The study
also outlines just what the children do when the parents are not
home. By Leslie Berger. (850 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Scientists researching the sweet tooth in mice have recognized
a gene that may keep them thin regardless of eating habits. They
hope they can eventually use the knowledge for people. (240 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Millions of Americans are living with pain, and are resigned
to that condition, a new study says. The Arthritis Foundation
reported last week that a Gallup poll of about 2,000 people found
that regular pain was a pervasive part of American life, but that
few people seek medical attention for it. (190 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Smoking in pregnancy has long been linked to general problems
like premature deliveries and babies with low birth weights, but a
new study reports that it may also be responsible for two specific
birth defects: cleft palate and cleft lip. (280 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Scientists have found a way to determine if people are in
early stages of Alzheimer's by comparing MRI brain scans. (300
words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers are using magnets to help move cancer-fighting
drugs laced with metallic substances to tumors. (165 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: What is the
rationale behind daylight saving time? You can't really ``save''
daylight. By C. Claiborne Ray. (300 words)

   ROME-EXHIBIT (Philadelphia) _ Imagine a city where Jacques-Louis
David insisted on working to execute a momentous commission from
the French king; where a 21-year-old aspiring artist from
Philadelphia named Benjamin West was taken to meet the pope; where
Fragonard, Piranesi, Anton Raphael Mengs, Antonio Canova, Angelika
Kauffmann and Jean-Antoine Houdon all lived, dined, traded ideas
and drank coffee together. That was Rome in the 18th century. With
those artists and others of many nationalities studying, working,
competing and cross-pollinating, cosmopolitan Rome _ not Paris _
was the cultural capital of Europe. That, at least, is the thesis
of ``The Splendor of 18th-Century Rome,'' a blockbuster exhibition
on view through May 28 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. By Judith
Dobrzynski. (1475 words)

CHINA REJECTS U.S. ACCOUNT OF EMBASSY BOMBING IN BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China Monday rejected the official U.S. explanation
for the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during NATO's
air war against Yugoslavia last year, and called the dismissal of a
mid-level Central Intelligence Agency officer inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   China's response indicated that its government remained deeply
suspicious of U.S. assurances that the bombing on May 7, which
killed three Chinese and wounded at least 20 others, was a mistake.
A spokesman for the foreign ministry in Beijing, Zhu Bangzao,
reiterated China's calls for the Clinton administration to conduct
a thorough investigation and to ``punish those responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 11 months after the bombing, the CIA dismissed one
officer and punished six others for their roles in identifying and
approving the target, which officials have said was intended to be
a military supply headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's spokesman insisted in a statement that the bombing
was ``a tragic accident,'' which officials have blamed on mistakes
made by the dismissed officer in locating the supply headquarters
on a map.
</P>
<P>
   Under Secretary of State Thomas R. Pickering notified the
Chinese ambassador to the United States of the punishment on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman disdained the
official U.S. explanation. ``To pretend that the United States did
not know the position of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia is not
credible,'' Zhu said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The intended target, the Federal Directorate of Supply and
Procurement, was nearly 1,000 feet from the embassy in the New
Belgrade section of the capital, and Zhu said the two buildings did
not resemble each other. ``It was impossible for the U.S. side to
mix up these two buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the embassy caused grave strains in relations
between the United States and China, leading to attacks by mobs on
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and a suspension of military ties and
other contacts with U.S. diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, however, Chinese officials had moderated their
complaints. Last December, the United States agreed to pay $28
million to compensate China for the damage caused to the building.
It had previously agreed to pay $4.5 million to the families of
those who were killed. In return, China agreed to pay $2.8 million
for damage to the U.S. Embassy

   LOS ANGELES _ It's been a long time since espionage was cool or
sexy. James Bond films aside, there hasn't been much call recently
for self-destructing tape messages or bugs concealed in fountain
pens.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War stole the spooks' main reason for
existing, and the Internet robbed them of their technological chic.
</P>
<P>
   But now the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency thinks it has hit
upon the ideal way to get its groove back. It is throwing caution
(and several tens of millions of dollars) to the wind, joining the
dot.com frenzy and investing in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few months, the CIA has been operating a small
venture capital fund out of San Mateo, south of San Francisco. But
In-Q-Tel is not just any venture capital fund.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, it is a nonprofit organization, which makes it a
bit of an oddity in the frenzied laboratory of the new world
economy, where every twentysomething computer whizz is happily
making a killing.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, In-Q-Tel has rather specialized interests. It's not
looking for the next cool way to swap musical downloads, or place
orders for organic groceries. What it wants is a super-smart search
engine to marshal all the information on the Internet _ in secret
if possible.
</P>
<P>
   What it wants is a computer security system that can both
protect data and foil hackers. Most of all, it wants these things
for itself, now, before everyone else gets wise to them and ruins
the mystique of it all.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it seems to be registering some modest success. It
started with $28 million in funds allocated from the CIA's main
budget, and is about to receive $34 million more with the blessing
of the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has invested in eight companies, including one with a
software package to track digital information, another specializing
in high-grade electronic sensors, and another boasting an
anti-hacking device called NetEraser.
</P>
<P>
   The man charged with the delicate task of making the CIA look
hip to the tech heads of Northern California is Gilman Louie, a
technological whizz in his own right who developed computer games
like Tetris and Hasbro Toys' flight simulator.
</P>
<P>
   Although well plugged into government _ he shuttles regularly
between California, Washington and the CIA's headquarters in
Langley, Va. _ he also walks the dot.com walk with his youthful
appearance, his black turtlenecks and his unpretentious manner.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he has any illusions about the precariousness of his
venture. He recently described it as being ``like making love in
Times Square: everyone gets to watch and everyone has an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   If In-Q-Tel (yes, that ``Q'' is an affectionate nod to the Bond
movies) is a success, it could be a nice little earner for the CIA
and its own research programs.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails, it will have one advantage most venture capitalists
can't boast: it can go back to Congress and beg for more money. &QL;

<P>
   Why is the stock-picking business so hard? Because reasonable
people can disagree. Because stock prices are based on popularity,
not principles. Because this is show biz, not Accounting 101.
</P>
<P>
   Take last week. On Thursday I gave a presentation about stocks I
want to own. Two presenters before me was Jim Chanos, a
professional short-seller whom I respect immensely. It was through
Jim's work that I avoided Boston Chicken and never believed in
Oxford Health. He steered me clear of Conseco, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, when I say ``through Jim's work,'' what I mean is that
I've heard him speak or read about the stocks he dislikes. While
I've met him a couple of times at hedge fund gatherings, we don't
collaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Chanos presented the case for shorting stocks like 4Kids
Entertainment (KIDE on the Nasdaq) -- although he didn't mention it
outright. The idea behind the short was that KIDE gets its revenues
from Pokemon and Chanos believes Pokemon has to peak because, well,
they all do in the end.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about how he has shorted these fad stocks before and
they have always turned out to be big home runs. He acknowledged,
however, that they tend to last longer than he expects. He also
pointed out that these stocks, once they stop moving up, seem very
cheap on earnings because the earnings are peaking.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he pointed out that his young kids are no longer into
Pokemon, so it must be over.
</P>
<P>
   The very next morning my trainer, Mike, comes in and he's all
excited. He has heard that Pokemon is introducing 100 new
characters and that the kids will want the cards for them all, so
he bought a ton of KIDE the day before. He wanted me to buy it. He
couldn't imagine how he could lose, as the stock sold so cheaply to
its earnings.
</P>
<P>
   So at dinner that night I asked my kids if they still loved
Pokemon as much as ever. Yes, of course, my eldest says, and there
are 100 new characters coming out and she wants to buy the cards
for every one of them and learn them.
</P>
<P>
   As fast as I wanted to short KIDE, I now wanted to cover it and
go long! Of course, I'll end up doing nothing. I respect the rigor
and history of Chanos' analysis of fads.
</P>
<P>
   But I also recognize the power of capitalist institutions to
evolve into higher and different life forms to keep the balls in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   And I understand the befuddlement so many feel about the stock
market, given that neither Chanos nor my trainer could both be
right at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The befuddlement stems from a fundamental truth: The game is
harder than the Ciscos and the Intels make it seem.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, if you're going to do it yourself, you must at least
do enough homework to understand the bear case, so it doesn't get
you down or, ultimately, triumph over you.

   Why is the stock-picking business so hard? Because reasonable
people can disagree. Because stock prices are based on popularity,
not principles. Because this is show biz, not Accounting 101.
</P>
<P>
   Take last week. On Thursday I gave a presentation about stocks I
want to own. Two presenters before me was Jim Chanos, a
professional short-seller whom I respect immensely. It was through
Jim's work that I avoided Boston Chicken and never believed in
Oxford Health. He steered me clear of Conseco, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, when I say ``through Jim's work,'' what I mean is that
I've heard him speak or read about the stocks he dislikes. While
I've met him a couple of times at hedge fund gatherings, we don't
collaborate.
</P>

Imagine Howard Stern and Dr. Laura Schlessinger working together _
well, maybe ``working'' and ``together'' wouldn't form the precise
term _ at the same radio station. Not a bad premise, but in ABC's
new comedy ``Talk to Me,'' it's undone by indifferent execution.
</P>
<P>
   Kyra Sedgwick stars as Janey Munro, a shock-jock (at least by
network television's standards-and-practices provisos) who, like
most sitcom characters who are career women at the beginning of a
series, is distraught over the end of a relationship. She has a
coterie of glib supporting players who work on her show, who would
be utterly interchangeable if the casting department didn't provide
helpful, simplistic cues _ cute guy (David Newsom), black guy (Mike
Estime), British guy (Max Baker).
</P>
<P>
   She, alas, also has a nebbishy boss (Peter Jacobson, in but a
very slight variation on Gordon Jump's mild-mannered mealy-mouth on
``WKRP in Cincinnati'') who is roundly held in thrall by Dr. Debra
(Beverly D'Angelo). Dr. Debra's a venomous, morality-spouting
manipulator who's the psychological equivalent of the WWF to her
callers, pile-driving their fragile psyches into the turnbuckles of
her own self-inflicted standards.
</P>
<P>
   You can see where creator-executive producer Suzanne Martin _
who previously worked on ``Frasier,'' also about radio-station egos
_ is going with this, but she's taking her sweet time doing it.
D'Angelo scarcely registers in the first two episodes, and she only
has one brief scene with Sedgwick, whose character is the dominant
one so far but is scarcely interesting enough to carry the series
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Sedgwick is entertaining as the young woman struggling to
exercise control over her life _ she has a funny scene in tonight's
episode where she wavers between tearful blubbering and exuding
cool machisma during a seduction _ but she's not terribly
convincing as the ``outrageous'' on-air personality. (Her character
wouldn't hold a job long if she routinely conducted interviews as
uninteresting as the one she does tonight, with Kiss' Gene
Simmons.)
</P>
<P>
   D'Angelo doesn't seem to have gotten a peg on her character yet,
either, but then, she hasn't been given much opportunity. But
Martin has already skewed the series such that when the inevitable
clashes do occur, D'Angelo won't have much leverage with the
audience. Holland Taylor would be perfect _ and far more
sympathetic _ in the role, but she's already got a job, on a far
better series, ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week's episode virtually screams flop sweat, as Janey
considers an arbitrary, poorly motivated lesbian fling while her
ditsy sister Kat (Nicole Sullivan) is offered a temporary on-air
job. These are story lines one might expect from an old show
grasping for ideas (Kat's story might be more amusing if viewers
knew the character better), not one fresh out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   Most problematic of all, ``Talk to Me'' could use better talk:
The dialogue basically lacks wit, and when it does have a little
snap, it feels utterly synthetic. The title, ultimately, is ironic,
because no one is trying to listen or, even, be heard; performers
simply seem to be biding time until they can pop off with their
next little self-satisfied wisecrack. The truth-in-advertising _
but admittedly off-putting _ title for this sitcom would be
``Listen to Me.''
</P>
<P>
   _______ &QL; 
The show: ``Talk to Me.'' &QL; 
What: Sitcom about bickering radio personalities. &QL;

THEY MADE LIVE TV `SAFE'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a measure of what an exceptional piece of material George
Clooney and company were working with that Sunday night's live
production of ``Fail Safe'' on CBS boasted nerve-racking tension
for reasons completely different than the one that no doubt lured
many viewers _ who was going to screw up?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: no one, at least not significantly. There was some
microphone static early on and a sound effect seemed to have a
phone hanging up before the conversation concluded. Get past that,
though, and you had a taut little drama, acted extremely well (with
exceptions) and smartly directed by Stephen Frears (whose current
film ``High Fidelity'' represents the high mark of Y2K cinema), who
cogently linked the disparate stories.
</P>
<P>
   I saw the live East Coast feed and glimpsed portions of the West
Coast feed _ didn't want to miss the ``Sopranos'' finale, after all
- which was ostensibly presented as a kinescope, but except for
changes in image texture that were only perceptible in close-up
shots, the feeds seemed pretty indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Clooney, out of nostalgia or love for
adrenaline rushes, has a real love for live TV _ he helped convince
NBC to do a live ``ER'' when he was on that series, and has long
stated Sunday night's ``Fail Safe'' as a dream project. Nowadays,
the live aspect is simply a gimmick, but this kind of ``event''
television may be one of the last ways massive audiences can be
assembled to inspire Monday-morning water-cooler quarterbacking in
TV's increasingly fractious world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fail Safe'' is based on a nail-biter of a book (at least
that's my childhood memory) by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler
that served as an early cautionary wallow in technophobia. The
story takes place during the Cold War, when computer malfunctions
inadvertently send a team of jet fighters carrying nuclear payloads
toward its Moscow target. America alerts Russia to the mistake and,
wishing to avert global nuclear disaster, must resort to
increasingly desperate measures, including sharing crucial military
information with the enemy in an effort to shoot down American
pilots who believe they're heroically serving their country.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's production boasted plenty of fire-power in the
cast, more even than Sidney Lumet's great, original 1964 film it
very closely mimicked. In addition to Clooney, who actually had a
pretty tiny role (along with Don Cheadle, he played a fighter pilot
delivering the deadly payload to Moscow), the presentation featured
Richard Dreyfuss as the president of the United States. In the
film, Henry Fonda handled the role quite memorably and with a sense
of weariness and common decency _ Dreyfuss interpreted the part
more urgently but didn't resort to histrionics, which can't always
be said of him.
</P>
<P>
   High marks also go to Brian Dennehy, a commanding presence in
the U.S. war room as Gen. Bogan, and Noah Wyle, who brought moments
of exquisite subtlety to his role as the president's translator,
Buck (played by a very young Larry Hagman in the original). Harvey
Keitel seemed kind of wooden as Blackie, the military officer
closely allied to the president but suffering from nightmares; Hank
Azaria's hawkish Professor Groteschele was written so
one-dimensionally that his scenes with Keitel were pretty much lost
causes (Walter Matthau managed the role with greater aplomb in
'64).
</P>
<P>
   With a running time a good half-hour shorter than the film
version, a lot of the texture was inevitably whittled away (which
severely truncated the tragic emotional resonance of Blackie's
character). Hence, we leaped more directly into the conflict, and
there was a fair amount of baldly expository dialogue. But this
also made for a lean, mean production that didn't have much time
for noodling around and therefore simply kept ratcheting up the
tension.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, this production didn't have a war-room colonel
flip out and attack Gen. Bogan, as happens in the film. On the
debit side, it brought in a child to make a manipulative pleading
dispatch to the fighter pilots as they approached Moscow. (On the
other hand, the character of the wife brought in for the film was
more shrill than the kid, so this difference probably registers as
neutral.) Frears, alas, wasn't able to match the devastating impact
of the original's finale, though he likely was plenty successful
for folks who haven't seen the earlier incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   One quibble: In a bid to make a political statement, the
production at evening's end listed all the countries that have
nuclear capability. Given the story's main premise, wouldn't it
have been just as relevant to list the countries with crummy
computer systems? &QL;

&HT;     ENVIRONMENTALISTS SEEK TO STALL NEW CALIFORNIA CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MERCED, Calif. _ Opposition to locating the University of
California system's 10th campus in the grasslands north of Merced
is coalescing around the issue of protecting thousands of vernal
pools.
</P>
<P>
   Vernal pools _ puddles that form and linger after rain _ are the
habitat for many rare species of flora and fauna, such as fairy
shrimp. The 10,300-acre UC-Merced campus planning area is the
largest unfragmented vernal pool site in California.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable calls for groundbreaking by the summer or early
fall of 2001 and the beginning of classes, with a first-year
student body of 1,000, in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But before the first shovel full of dirt is turned, university
officials and Merced County will have to navigate a permitting
process daunting in scope and complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Separate environmental reviews are under way by UC-Merced
officials and Merced County, which is also revising its general
plan to factor in an entire new residential community of 30,000
people adjoining the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the works are a Clean Water Act study that will require
approval by both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the
Environmental Protection Agency as well as a long-term regional
conservation plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long process, and we're all scrambling because the
governor wants to get it started,'' said Elizabeth Borowiec, who is
monitoring the university campus project for the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   Merced planning chief Clifford Graves is hopeful that the
permits prerequisite to groundbreaking will be in hand by next
summer. The campus has the support of Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat,
and Vice President Al Gore, who has vowed to put federal
environmental approval on a fast track.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Burke, a Modesto environmental advocate and spokesman
for a new coalition, Protect Our Water, said the timetable is too
ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of process, they're barely at square one,'' said
Burke, 50, who ran a backpacking store in Davis before taking up
full-time environmental advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   UC-Merced is Davis' pet higher education project. Nevertheless,
Burke maintains that ``there is a serious issue here that they just
can't gloss over.''
</P>
<P>
   To drill in the point, the Protect Our Water organization has
hired a law firm, which has warned the University of California and
Merced County officials that until a Clean Water Act permit is
obtained, spending money on the campus site is ``inappropriate and
should cease.'' The university system does not yet have title to
the property.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers still awaits the university
system's application for the Clean Water Act permit, said spokesman
Jason Fansellau. The Corps' analysis will ``include looking at a
completely separate location'' for the campus if the size of the
proposed campus cannot be minimized.
</P>
<P>
   The next budget proposed by Davis includes $24.3 million for the
UC-Merced campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental issues talked about are very well known and
documented, and we have been working diligently to address them,''
Graves said. ``We have made a commitment to treading lightly on the
land and being environmentally responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   As for potential legal problems, ``we are confident at this
point that we have an approach that will be approved'' by both the
courts and regulatory agencies, Graves said.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Samuelson, senior associate to the chancellor and director
emeritus of University of California's Natural Reserve System, said
that the comprehensive university and county planning process now
under way will maximize preservation of the site's ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   And while there are at least 7,000 vernal pools in the
10,300-acre planning area, ``only 3 to 7 percent of the pools are
on the 2,000-acre campus site,'' he said. About 3,000 of the
remaining 8,300 acres will be developed for residential and
commercial uses, with the rest left in open space.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson acknowledged that university officials still have some
missionary work to do with environmentalists, including faculty
members, if they are to meet the governor's timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson and other UC-Merced officials toured the campus site
with eight biologists and environmental scientists from other
campuses on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Brent Mischler, director of UC-Berkeley's Jepson
Herbarium, whose field is integrated biology. ``We wanted to
volunteer our expertise to the planners . . . to help them make
decisions (with) politically neutral advice,'' Mishler said.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson acknowledged that faculty criticism needs to be dealt
with and expressed the hopes that critics will ``come around on
some of their views'' when they're fully backgrounded on plans for
the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Although the site selection process for the system's 10th campus
began in 1988 and culminated in 1995 with the selection of the
Merced site, some critics believe that the environmental
sensitivity of the site was insufficiently publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Mischler conceded that serious criticism of the site selected
comes late in the game. ``We can't blame the administration
entirely for that,'' he said. ``When the process was going on, no
one was too concerned, probably because we were really busy. ...
But now the biology faculty of the university is concerned about
it. We want to do this right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tehipite chapter of the Sierra Club opposes the Merced site.
``It's a sprawl-inducing site,'' said Shannon Eddy, acting director
of the state office of the Sierra Club in Sacramento. ``They want
to build a six-lane parkway over land with nothing on it now except
the most pristine vernal pool site in California.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all greed development with the university as the
centerpiece, just like UC-Irvine,'' said Jeanne Larson, president
of the California Native Plant Society's Fresno chapter. ``It's one
of the most beautiful and last places where we have these vernal
pools and pristine conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Tolson, steward of five Northern California natural
reserves for the University of California system, said opponents of
the Merced campus site are battling uphill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly unlikely they're going to change their minds, but
it needs to be said that that's a stupid place to put it, to
destroy something pristine that's already there,'' Tolson aid.
``From a strictly ecological view, there are plenty of places where
a new university could be situated,'' such as the abandoned Castle
Air Force Base near Merced, he said.

&HT;     NEW BRIDGE TO EASE CONGESTION IN HOT BORDER CROSSING 
</HEADLINE>

   LAREDO, Texas _ This border city, perennially congested by
18-wheelers that are the telltale sign of the booming trade between
the United States and Mexico, is getting a break from gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a new crossing will open and cargo trucks will be
prohibited from using either downtown span over the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to cross the river like we'd cross any street to go to
a restaurant or to visit our friends,'' said Laredo Mayor Betty
Flores, a lifelong resident. ``We used to do that all day long
every day as if it were nothing. Now it's a chore.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new $60 million World Trade Bridge, the adjacent
infrastructure and federal port facilities, city leaders hope to
relieve much of the downtown congestion.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday, cargo trucks will be rerouted at the Bob Bullock
Loop interchange, eight miles north of downtown, and shunted onto a
new highway to the new bridge.
</P>
<P>
   There, the trucks can snake along five miles of winding drives
well away from commuters and tourists who have borne the costs of
the North American Free Trade Agreement, which also has brought
many benefits to this city of 185,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA, which lowered tariffs on goods bought and sold among the
United States, Mexico and Canada, took effect on Jan. 1, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the city's bridges have seen the number of truck
crossings double, reaching 1.3 million last year. With booming
commercial transportation needs have come breathtaking population
growth _ the second-fastest in the nation _ and new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Laredo has been lifted out of the
double-digit unemployment doldrums that plague America's southwest
border. The jobless rate fell to 8.1 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   Trade has been so good for Laredo that the city effectively
loaned Washington the money to build the port surrounding the new
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The General Services Administration will pay the city $18
million annually for 20 years, acting City Manager Cynthia Collazo
said.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth international crossing is planned within 10 years.

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS NAME NEW LEADER AS THEY BATTLE KOHL SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESSEN, Germany _ Angela Merkel, a woman raised in a communist
system, took control Monday of the Christian Democratic Union , the
conservative movement that has dominated post-war German politics
but now faces a crisis over its finances and its identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democratic Union is not about to implode as its
sister party did in Italy during the 1990's. Although battered by a
financial scandal over the past four months, the party has shown
itself to be too close to the conservative German soul, too
essential to block the emergence of a nationalist right and too
central to Germany's democracy itself.
</P>
<P>
   But it was quickly clear at a three-day party congress here that
began Sunday that the Christian Democrats face problems far deeper
than the slush fund scandal that has tarnished the reputation of
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the point that he has chosen not
to appear at this meeting. He had not missed a party congress since
1951.
</P>
<P>
   Merkel, a 45-year-old physicist who spent most of her life in
the former East Germany, is determined to craft what she has called
a ``new beginning.'' She was overwhelmingly elected leader Monday
by party delegates here, bringing a fresh face, a beguiling manner
and a steely determination to an enormous task.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Ms. Merkel is about a new style in politics, one that
is direct, honest and clear,'' said Hannelore Heuser, a party
member from southern Germany. ``That is the most drastic and
significant change after what we now perceive as the dangerous
murkiness of the Kohl system.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the honeymoon wears off, Merkel's clear-eyed gaze and
frank talk may not be enough to overcome the crisis she faces. Put
bluntly, the Christian Democratic party _ now in opposition after
16 years in power under Kohl _ no longer knows what it is, and it
is broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zur Sache'' _ ``back to business'' _ screamed the slogans
here, an attempt to signal that the fallout from the uncovering of
tens of millions of dollars in party funds in Swiss bank accounts
and illegal campaign contributions is over.
</P>
<P>
   But with communism gone and little socialism left to fight,
religion ever less significant in German society, and the governing
Social Democrats busy showing their centrist credentials by
slashing taxes and promoting the interests of large companies, the
remaining business of the Christian Democrats remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party no longer has a broad and integrating idea for our
post-socialist and increasingly post-Christian society,'' commented
Tobias Duerr in the influential weekly Die Zeit. Its support has
fallen from traditional postwar levels of over 40 percent to under
35 percent _ still the backing of a mass party but not enough to
win national elections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most frequent image evoked here to suggest the party's
future was that of a bridge. Delegate after delegate used it to
suggest a movement that will represent globalization and the
fatherland, modernity and community, managers and workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of the social-market economy and we will
remain so even in this time of globalization,'' said Juergen
Ruettgers, who is fighting an uphill battle to dislodge the Social
Democrats in an election in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia
next month. ``We are the bridge between the market and human
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking up a similar theme, Norbert Blum, a former labor
minister under Kohl, thundered: ``I can't drink a beer on the
Internet. We still need our social state, our good-neighborliness,
our hands outstretched to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that Christian Democracy does not look much like
a bridge today. Germany's ponderous social-market, consensus-based,
postwar model is cracking, and the shifting, fast-moving
shareholding culture of the ``new economy'' is taking hold. The
party's response is divided, for it created the model that is now
dying.
</P>
<P>
   Some on the right of the party favor a wholehearted embrace of a
fiercely competitive model free of the heavy costs of welfare;
others, among them Merkel, say the essence of the German social
insurance system must be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Certain officials, like Ruettgers, see political capital in an
anti-immigrant message at a time of fears over global economic
pressures. Others, like Merkel, say such an approach is
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich Merz, the 44-year-old new leader of the party's
faction in parliament, says his generation is tired of being held
responsible for Germany's Nazi past and bitterly attacks the
government for isolating Austria because of the presence of Joerg
Haider's rightist party in the government. Others, including the
new general secretary, Ruprecht Polenz, warn that ``it is critical
that we not drift to the right.''
</P>
<P>
   In a much-applauded speech, Merkel tried hard Monday to dismiss
such divisions. ``It is precisely because we unite
Christian-Social, conservative and liberal convictions that we are
the broad people's party of the center,'' she said. Looking back at
Europe's unification and Germany's, she said the party was
``history's winner.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that many currents have always flowed through
Christian Democracy, and the party's contribution to peace and
integration in Europe has been enormous. But the world has changed,
and the Social Democrats of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder have
declared themselves the ``new middle'' and occupied the center
ground once held by Christian Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle, there is now a huge overlap between the two big
parties, and that is a considerable problem for us,'' said Lothar
Hegemann, an insurance broker, Christian Democrat for three decades
and delegate from Duesseldorf. ``Germans do not like changes of
government, and I fear that unless Mr. Schroeder makes a big
mistake, he probably has the next election in 2002 sewn up.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Christian Democrats' problems in fighting that
election was evident here at the austere opening-night dinner _
cold ham, potato salad and cabbage. The smoked fish, the roast
duck, the vast array of delicacies that marked the flush feasts
during Kohl's rule were gone, victims of financial hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Matthias Wissmann, the treasurer, said the party faces an annual
deficit of over $8 million and will have to cut personnel, rent out
part of its new Berlin headquarters and shrink its publications.
</P>
<P>
   Only with exceptional contributions from party members, he
added, will the means be found to overcome the results of lax
financial management and a $21 million fine imposed for illegal
acts by Kohl and other party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every crisis is an opportunity,'' Merkel said Monday. But the
crisis is deep, and the opportunities still unclear.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, April 11:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASTEROIDS (Undated) _ Taking cautious, baby steps, a
spacecraft called NEAR Shoemaker is to settle Monday into a closer
orbit of an asteroid it has been circling for almost two months.
Guided by gentle shoves from small thruster rockets, the robotic
craft is taking up a circular orbit 62-miles from the center of
Eros for more detailed studies. After spending about 11 days at
this altitude, the craft is to take another downstep on its way to
settling in at a height of 31 miles for months of closeup
observations of the pitted, tumbling, rocky mass below. By Warren
E. Leary.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GALAXY-CANNIBALISM (Undated) _ Astronomers have long
suspected that a dark secret about Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way.
They have even seen other galaxies engaging in the macabre behavior
at the core of this secret. But without irrefutable proof,
astronomers refused to admit that it might be commonplace closer to
home. Now, sadly, they have that proof. The Milky Way is a chronic
cannibal. It consumes other galaxies and makes their stars its own.
(550 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FRUIT-FLY (Undated) _ The Drosophila fruit fly, whose genome
was just decoded, has attained vast prominence in human affairs
because it is one of the principal model organisms studied by
biologists as a means of understanding the general design of life.
Because of the unity of evolution, the fly's genes and those of
people overlap considerably. Their advocates, who call themselves
fly people, are easily provoked into confessing that they think of
people as large flies that lack wings. And over the past 93 years,
the fly has a long and celebrated history in biology and genetics.
By Nichols Wade. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEPATITIS-C (Washington) _ The discovery of 50-year-old Army
blood samples in helping scientists determine what the best course
of treatment may be for hepatitis C. Now, some contend that
aggressive treatment, which can be painful and cause side effects,
should be used in almost all cases. Other say that the odds of
contracting symptoms of the disease are small and the more moderate
approaches are called for. By Gina Kolata. (1950 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT1.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VA-ARCHEO (Philadelphia) _ With new evidence, archaeologists
have more firmly dated a site in Virginia at 15,900 years, making
it much earlier than sites found on the West Coast and raising the
possibility that first human occupation sites were on East Coast.
It also gives further credence for placing human in the Western
Hemisphere earlier than previously thought. By John Noble Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BIG-ICEBERGS (Undated) _ Two mammoth icebergs have broken
off the Antarctic ice cap in the past several weeks, including one
that is the largest in more than four decades. By Henry Fountain.
(300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GORILLA-TECH (Undated) _ Since Dr. Dian Fossey began
studying the mountain gorillas of Rwanda and adjoining countries in
the 1960s, researchers have tracked, with some interruptions, the
fortunes of these engaging creatures in a perpetually endangered
jungle. Now, a collaboration of several American and Rwandan
institutions is taking that program to the edge of high technology,
using remote sensing from satellites and aircraft and electronic
trackers on the ground to create a vastly expanded, instantly
accessible record of the gorillas and their habitat in digital
form. By James Glanz. (1325 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT2, and a map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VAROS (Washington) _ Remedios Varo, considered one of the
greatest surrealist painters of the 20th century, is at last
beginning to receive international acclaim, including the
admiration of a cadre not always known for its art house savvy: the
scientific community. In a recent symposium, an expert described
how the artist metaphorically conveyed some of the most
revolutionary and complex scientific theories of the age, from
Einstein's special theory of relativity and Darwin's theory of
evolution by natural selection to the premise that humans are the
stuff of stars. By Natalie Angier (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photos, NYT3,4.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on the
tail of Comet Hyakutake (it's 330 million miles long), e. coli
contamination in cow manure and ways to kill it, and the thornback
ray's method of purging its stomach. By Henry Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEART-DIET (Undated) _ Medicare is now undertaking a radical
diet experiment in several centers to determine if critically ill
heart patients can become better by radically altering their diets
and their daily routines under the Dean Ornisch diet. They hope to
determine if they can cut costs for heart procedures through
preventive steps. They also should reveal on a large scale just how
effective the diet, which has its critics, really is. By Barbara
Whitaker. (1725 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BROCKOVITCH-SCIENCE (Undated) _ Reflections column. Many
scientists are offended by the movie ``Erin Brockovitch.'' The
problem, they say, is not that they cannot enjoy a good yarn in
which virtue triumphs over evil and the little guys win. It is a
more subtle: while it is easy to see that the sex and even the
violence in movies are fantasies, it is hard for any but scientists
to discern when science in movies crosses the line from verity to
hyperbole and indoctrination. The end result, some say, is to help
perpetuate misconceptions about scientific evidence and about the
risks of everyday life. By Gina Kolata. (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: With
the arrival of spring, allergies are not necessarily inevitable.
Many drugs, old and new, are on the market now and have proved to
be highly effective. Some are grossly underused. By Jane E. Brody.
(1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILDREN-ALONE (Undated) _ Twelve to 14 percent of American
children ages 5 to 12 spend some time home alone after school, a
new study has found, but the period without adult supervision
averages only an hour, most of the children are older, and many
seem to welcome a measure of privacy and independence. The study
also outlines just what the children do when the parents are not
home. By Leslie Berger. (850 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Scientists researching the sweet tooth in mice have recognized
a gene that may keep them thin regardless of eating habits. They
hope they can eventually use the knowledge for people. (240 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Millions of Americans are living with pain, and are resigned
to that condition, a new study says. The Arthritis Foundation
reported last week that a Gallup poll of about 2,000 people found
that regular pain was a pervasive part of American life, but that
few people seek medical attention for it. (190 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Smoking in pregnancy has long been linked to general problems
like premature deliveries and babies with low birth weights, but a
new study reports that it may also be responsible for two specific
birth defects: cleft palate and cleft lip. (280 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Scientists have found a way to determine if people are in
early stages of Alzheimer's by comparing MRI brain scans. (300
words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers are using magnets to help move cancer-fighting
drugs laced with metallic substances to tumors. (165 words)

A TRIBUTE TO THE POST-IT NOTE ON ITS 20TH ANNIVERSARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am a Post-it Note junkie. Phone numbers, grocery lists,
messages of vital importance to the spouse (''Call travel agent re:
trip to Fiji!''). At work, I am running out of stickable spots for
these eminently addicting communication devices. There are
currently 19 Post-its applied haphazardly around my work station:
basic reminders (''Pay rent''), important phone numbers (''Computer
guy x.7658''), and cryptic minimemos to which even I can no longer
assign meaning (''13816 Star, 109 pg.''). In desperate times, I
occasionally stick Post-its to myself.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting in this electronic age that Post-it Notes,
which require setting pen to paper, continue to gain popularity.
But 20 years after they were first introduced to pushpin-weary
Americans, Post-its still cling _ lightly and conveniently _ to the
popular landscape.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1. Eureka!
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Silver calls it a ``classic case of serendipity.'' In
1968, Silver, a scientist for the research and technology company
3M, was trying to create a water-soluble adhesive. He devised an
experiment that, well, flopped, but it resulted in a new and
curious adhesive, one that stuck readily but not tightly to
surfaces. Under the microscope, the adhesive's uniform spheres
``kind of sparkled in the light,'' Silver says. He embarked on a
search with his 3M colleagues for a way to use the new invention.
(3M is the same company that gave us Scotch tape and the clothing
insulator Thinsulate.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   2. Aha!
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, Art Fry, an employee in 3M's retail-tape
division, is a member of his church choir. But sometime between
Wednesday practice and Sunday service, the bookmark flagging that
week's hymns falls out. ``I was trying to find my place, and the
sermon was a little dull that day, so I thought, I wonder if I
could make a bookmark that would stay in place?'' Fry, who had been
a new-product developer at 3M for 20 years, remembers his colleague
Silver's earlier discovery and high-tails it back to the lab. He
applies the adhesive to the back of his bookmark. Hurray! It
sticks! It comes off! It sticks again!
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   3. The idea sticks
</P>
<P>
   Fry tries the bookmarks out on his colleagues. ``They thought it
was cool but they didn't use any,'' he says. Then, one day, Fry is
writing a report. He flags a page and jots a note on the sticky
bookmark with an arrow pointing to the text. Wait a minute, he
thinks, I can write on this sticky paper?! Within a week, Fry has a
revamped prototype, and his colleagues catch Post-it Note fever.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   4. Consumers take note
</P>
<P>
   Marketing the sticky pads takes time. 3M calls the invention a
``repositionable note'' in brochures and ads, and consumers seem
confused. So in 1978 3M inundates Boise, Idaho, with Post-its,
handing out thousands of samples (3M now refers to that event the
as the ``Boise Blitz''). Ninety percent of the people who try the
product say they will buy it themselves. In 1980, Post-its goes
national.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   5. Sticker shock
</P>
<P>
   A direct-mail campaign to Fortune 500 CEOs results in a letter
back to 3M from Lee Iacocca, who loves the sticky-notes concept.
Back then, the original Post-its are called ``Press and Peel''
notes, and the 3-inch-by-5-inch pad sells for 98 cents. By 1990,
they were called Post-it Notes.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   6. Happily ever after
</P>
<P>
   Post-it fame didn't really change the lives of Silver and Fry
(well, maybe a little: ``People started listening to me in the
lab,'' laughs Silver). Neither got rich from the invention (which
is the property of the company), but it has ``earned us a lot of
respect within 3M.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver retired in 1996 after 30 years with the company and 22
U.S. patents to his name (he worked on the technology behind
box-sealing tape for a while). Fry, semiretired, lectures around
the world was named by Esquire magazine as one of ``The 100 Best
People in the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the introduction of Post-its, numerous companies have
copied the ``repositionable note'' idea.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TRUE STORIES
</P>
<P>
   A Minnesota woman once bribed a Russian official, whose
signature she needed to approve an adoption, by furnishing the
official with Post-it pads and some pens.
</P>
<P>
   A sleepy traveler in the Atlanta airport, not wanting to doze
off and miss his flight, decorated himself with Post-it Notes
asking fellow travelers to ``Please wake me for the 8:35 a.m.
flight to Savannah. Thank you.'' It worked.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of scientist Silver applies Post-its on their home's
sliding glass doors, so guests don't walk into them.
</P>
<P>
   Fry, the 3M product developer, affixes Post-its to his tie when
he eats airplane meals: ``Voila!'' Post-it bib!
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MORE USES
</P>
<P>
   Decorate a newlywed's car.
</P>
<P>
   Make a cartoon flip book.
</P>
<P>
   Label leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   Use for New Year's resolutions reminders and ``quit smoking''
reminders
</P>
<P>
   Keep cats busy by sticking Post-its to their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Make price tags for garage-sale items.

</P>
<P>
   ``Post''-modern
</P>
<P>
   Alaskan artist Melynda Schwier-Gierard uses up to 60,000 Post-it
Notes in each of her wall-sized panels, folding and applying the
Post-its in intricate designs.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide
</P>
<P>
   Post-it Notes come in 27 sizes, 56 shapes and 50 colors, and are
sold in 100 countries. In Japan and China, consumers prefer their
Post-its as small narrow strips instead of larger horizontal pads.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Wide world
</P>
<P>
   It would take approximately 506.9 million Post-it Notes (the
27/8-inch square ones) to circle the globe.

   BBA-YANKS-USHERS (New York) _ The hundreds of ushers that once
worked Yankee Stadium have steadily been replaced by beefy security
guards over the years. Now there are 8 ushers left, all in their
60s through 80s, and they will likely become extinct after this
season. Why? During negotiations, the Yankees claimed they could no

they needed it for players salaries. By Corey Kilgannon.

   SCI-ASTEROIDS (Undated) _ Taking cautious, baby steps, a
spacecraft called NEAR Shoemaker is to settle Monday into a closer
orbit of an asteroid it has been circling for almost two months.
Guided by gentle shoves from small thruster rockets, the robotic
craft is taking up a circular orbit 62-miles from the center of
Eros for more detailed studies. After spending about 11 days at
this altitude, the craft is to take another downstep on its way to
settling in at a height of 31 miles for months of closeup
observations of the pitted, tumbling, rocky mass below. By Warren
E. Leary.

   SCI-GALAXY-CANNIBALISM (Undated) _ Astronomers have long
suspected that a dark secret about Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way.
They have even seen other galaxies engaging in the macabre behavior
at the core of this secret. But without irrefutable proof,
astronomers refused to admit that it might be commonplace closer to
home. Now, sadly, they have that proof. The Milky Way is a chronic
cannibal. It consumes other galaxies and makes their stars its own.

   SCI-FRUIT-FLY (Undated) _ The Drosophila fruit fly, whose genome
was just decoded, has attained vast prominence in human affairs
because it is one of the principal model organisms studied by
biologists as a means of understanding the general design of life.
Because of the unity of evolution, the fly's genes and those of
people overlap considerably. Their advocates, who call themselves
fly people, are easily provoked into confessing that they think of
people as large flies that lack wings. And over the past 93 years,
the fly has a long and celebrated history in biology and genetics.
By Nichols Wade. (1400 words)

<P>
   SCI-HEPATITIS-C (Washington) _ The discovery of 50-year-old Army
blood samples in helping scientists determine what the best course
of treatment may be for hepatitis C. Now, some contend that
aggressive treatment, which can be painful and cause side effects,
should be used in almost all cases. Other say that the odds of
contracting symptoms of the disease are small and the more moderate
approaches are called for. By Gina Kolata. (1950 words)

<P>
   SCI-VA-ARCHEO (Philadelphia) _ With new evidence, archaeologists
have more firmly dated a site in Virginia at 15,900 years, making
it much earlier than sites found on the West Coast and raising the
possibility that first human occupation sites were on East Coast.
It also gives further credence for placing human in the Western
Hemisphere earlier than previously thought. By John Noble Wilford.

   SCI-GORILLA-TECH (Undated) _ Since Dr. Dian Fossey began
studying the mountain gorillas of Rwanda and adjoining countries in
the 1960s, researchers have tracked, with some interruptions, the
fortunes of these engaging creatures in a perpetually endangered
jungle. Now, a collaboration of several American and Rwandan
institutions is taking that program to the edge of high technology,
using remote sensing from satellites and aircraft and electronic
trackers on the ground to create a vastly expanded, instantly
accessible record of the gorillas and their habitat in digital
form. By James Glanz. (1325 words)

   SCI-VAROS (Washington) _ Remedios Varo, considered one of the
greatest surrealist painters of the 20th century, is at last
beginning to receive international acclaim, including the
admiration of a cadre not always known for its art house savvy: the
scientific community. In a recent symposium, an expert described
how the artist metaphorically conveyed some of the most
revolutionary and complex scientific theories of the age, from
Einstein's special theory of relativity and Darwin's theory of
evolution by natural selection to the premise that humans are the
stuff of stars. By Natalie Angier (1250 words)

contamination in cow manure and ways to kill it, and the thornback
ray's method of purging its stomach. By Henry Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEART-DIET (Undated) _ Medicare is now undertaking a radical
diet experiment in several centers to determine if critically ill
heart patients can become better by radically altering their diets
and their daily routines under the Dean Ornisch diet. They hope to
determine if they can cut costs for heart procedures through
preventive steps. They also should reveal on a large scale just how
effective the diet, which has its critics, really is. By Barbara
Whitaker. (1725 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BROCKOVITCH-SCIENCE (Undated) _ Reflections column. Many
scientists are offended by the movie ``Erin Brockovitch.'' The
problem, they say, is not that they cannot enjoy a good yarn in
which virtue triumphs over evil and the little guys win. It is a
more subtle: while it is easy to see that the sex and even the
violence in movies are fantasies, it is hard for any but scientists
to discern when science in movies crosses the line from verity to
hyperbole and indoctrination. The end result, some say, is to help
perpetuate misconceptions about scientific evidence and about the
risks of everyday life. By Gina Kolata. (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: With
the arrival of spring, allergies are not necessarily inevitable.

</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILDREN-ALONE (Undated) _ Twelve to 14 percent of American
children ages 5 to 12 spend some time home alone after school, a
new study has found, but the period without adult supervision
averages only an hour, most of the children are older, and many
seem to welcome a measure of privacy and independence. The study
also outlines just what the children do when the parents are not
home. By Leslie Berger. (850 words)

hope they can eventually use the knowledge for people. (240 words)

   _ Millions of Americans are living with pain, and are resigned
to that condition, a new study says. The Arthritis Foundation
reported last week that a Gallup poll of about 2,000 people found
that regular pain was a pervasive part of American life, but that
few people seek medical attention for it. (190 words)
</P>

   ROME-EXHIBIT (Philadelphia) _ Imagine a city where Jacques-Louis
David insisted on working to execute a momentous commission from
the French king; where a 21-year-old aspiring artist from
Philadelphia named Benjamin West was taken to meet the pope; where
Fragonard, Piranesi, Anton Raphael Mengs, Antonio Canova, Angelika
Kauffmann and Jean-Antoine Houdon all lived, dined, traded ideas
and drank coffee together. That was Rome in the 18th century. With
those artists and others of many nationalities studying, working,
competing and cross-pollinating, cosmopolitan Rome _ not Paris _
was the cultural capital of Europe. That, at least, is the thesis
of ``The Splendor of 18th-Century Rome,'' a blockbuster exhibition
on view through May 28 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. By Judith
Dobrzynski. (1475 words)

A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Team strawberries and chocolate _ two favorite flavors _ in
dynamite desserts to welcome spring. Stunning-looking and
fabulous-tasting creations are feasible with the juicy, red
beauties and various shades and flavors of rich chocolate. Many are
quick and easy creations.
</P>
<P>
   Start with these delectable and fun ways to mix and match
strawberries and chocolate:
</P>
<P>
   _ Top slices of a flourless chocolate cake or chocolate truffle
cake (or even a store-bought chocolate pound cake) with sweetened
strawberries (splashed with a dash of Grand Marnier or Chambord)
and poufs of freshly whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fill a chocolate angel food cake with strawberry mousse and
frost with chocolate whipped cream for a luscious ending to a meal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fresh whole strawberries skewered with other fresh fruits like
melon, pineapple or banana pieces and drizzled with homemade hot
fudge sauce, are fast to turn out and taste terrific. To make a
quick sauce, combine semisweet or bittersweet chocolate in a glass
measuring cup with a little whipping cream or milk in the microwave
oven just until chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth when
stirred.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fill cream puffs or meringue shells with plain or chocolate
whipped cream (or custard) and cut-up fresh berries; drizzle hot
fudge or milk chocolate sauce over all.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spread a thin layer of chocolate ganache (chocolate melted
with a little cream and butter) in a tart or pie shell (chocolate,
graham cracker or shortbread). Once the chocolate is chilled and
set, arrange whole fresh berries on top, pointed sides up. Brush
with melted apricot, strawberry or raspberry jam, if desired.
Refrigerate until serving time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make chocolate napoleans by sandwiching together layers of
frozen puff pastry dough, thawed and baked according to package
directions, with chocolate mousse or chocolate pudding and thinly
sliced fresh berries. Garnish top with a drizzle of melted
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your favorite chocolate mousse, layered with cut-up berries in
a stemmed glass or wine goblet, makes a yummy finale.
</P>
<P>
   For cheesecake lovers, top a chocolate chip or white chocolate
cheesecake with dark or milk chocolate-dipped berries. Or serve
slices of a chocolate cheesecake, with strawberry sauce ladled over
the top and alongside.
</P>
<P>
   _ For a really quick and tempting sweet, pick up your favorite
flavor of chocolate ice cream or frozen yogurt and top scoops with
whole or chopped berries and a little melted raspberry or
strawberry jam or hot fudge sauce. Sprinkle with nuts, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gussy up creme brulee, rice pudding or tapioca with strawberry
slices and chocolate sauce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget trifle. You can make a chocolate version almost
instantly by layering slices of store-bought chocolate pound cake
(or other chocolate cake) with layers of sweetened whipped cream
zipped up with a little of your favorite liqueur and assorted fresh
berries. Sometimes instead of using whipped cream for a filling, I
mix up a package of instant chocolate or vanilla pudding and pie
filling mix with half the amount of milk called for _ and then fold
in a cup of whipping cream, whipped.
</P>
<P>
   _ A chocolate souffle topped with strawberry sauce or simply
fresh berries and plenty of whipped cream is divine.
</P>
<P>
   _ If an easy pie is called for, whip up a package of instant
chocolate pudding and pie filling mix (reduce the amount of milk
called for to make sure the pie firms up) with sliced berries and
bananas nestled in the middle. Drizzle slices with hot fudge sauce
just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   _ For something cool in the drink department, whir up a shake
with fresh berries that you've frozen, ice cream and a little
chocolate syrup (or swirl in some hot fudge topping and add some to
the top).
</P>
<P>
   _ A dessert pizza is a showstopping party dessert for a crowd.
Make a chocolate crumb or chocolate pastry in a 14-inch pizza pan
and bake if necessary. Then top with vanilla or chocolate pudding
(you can buy it premade in the refrigerator deli section of the
market, if desired) and sliced or whole strawberries. It's bound to
rate raves without much work.
</P>
<P>
   _ A two-layer chocolate cake baked from a mix is a good base for
a festive berry dessert and a good choice with time at a premium.
Spread one baked and cooled cake layer with whipped cream, either
sweetened or unsweetened and slices of fresh berries. Top with
second layer and spread more whipped cream over tops and sides.
Arrange whole berries, pointed sides up, all over the top.
Refrigerate until serving time. This is best made and served the
same day.
</P>
<P>
   _ And of course we couldn't forget chocolate strawberry
shortcake _ either make your own chocolate version of the cake
(substitute unsweetened cocoa powder for some of the flour in a
standard recipe or look for a chocolate shortcake recipe) or use
store-bought cakes or chocolate cookies and top with sweetened
berries and whipped cream, either plain or with some cocoa powder
and a splash of amaretto, rum or Grand Marnier folded in.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate and strawberries are hard to beat.

CALIFORNIA STRAWBERRIES

   Juicy, red ripe strawberries _ those harbingers of spring _ are
abundant and bursting with flavor at farmers' markets and
supermarkets now.
</P>
<P>
   California strawberry acreage is up 7 percent from last year due
to strong consumer demand. ``Ninety-four percent of people in the
United States eat strawberries,'' according to Dominique Jordan,
communications specialist for the Watsonville-based California
Strawberry Commission.
</P>
<P>
   That means consumers can expect to find plenty of berries
available this spring, summer and fall. California strawberries
(the state grows 83 percent of the U.S. crop) are shedding their
image as just a spring and summer fruit, said Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   They are becoming a year-round Calfornia crop because of the
array of new varieties grown in different parts of the state as
well as the staggered planting dates and harvesting times. The
majority of the October-to-April strawberry harvest comes from
Southern California, while both Southern and Northern areas provide
the harvest during the peak May-to-September season.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to buying strawberries, Jordan recommends looking
for those with bright red color, a good shine and fresh _ not
wilted _ green caps. Keep in mind that unlike some other fruits,
strawberries do not ripen after picking.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, store berries unwashed in a single layer on a baking
sheet _ lined and topped with paper towels _ in the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   Just prior to using, rinse berries with caps on (to prevent
water from breaking down the texture and flavor inside the
berries). Spray gently with cool water and pat dry with paper
towels. Then remove caps with the point of a sharp paring knife.
</P>
<P>
   Generally figure on using berries within four to five days of
buying. How long they'll keep depends on their freshness when
purchased.
</P>
<P>
   You can also wash, hull and individually flash-freeze berries in
a single layer on a baking sheet and then store them in
freezer-safe bags.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberries are a good source of vitamin C. It takes just five
medium berries to provide 100 percent of the recommended daily
intake. A cup of whole fresh strawberries has about 55 calories. &QL;

`SHAKESPEARE'S KINGS': SHAKESPEARE AND HISTORICAL ACCURACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of the review.) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The period covered by Shakespeare's nine English histories _
from ``Edward III'' and ``Richard II'' through the six Henry (IV,
V, VI) plays and ending with ``Richard III'' _ is one of the
bloodiest and most melodramatic in that island nation's past. It is
a period of almost continual fighting: in addition to the Hundred
Years' War with France and that destructive civil conflict known as
the Wars of the Roses, there were myriad plots, conspiracies and
intrigues pitting brother against brother and cousin against
cousin. As for the country's 14th- and 15th-century rulers, writes
John Julius Norwich in his colorful new book, they included ``some
of the worst kings who have ever disgraced a throne.'' Only with
the rise of Henry Tudor (Henry VII) in 1485 would England be
ushered into a new era of ``peace and tranquillity.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Shakespeare's Kings,'' Norwich _ the author of a
three-volume history of Byzantium, among other books, and a member
of the House of Lords _ sets out to assess just how closely the
playwright's works correspond to English history. He has written a
lively if not particularly scholarly book that turns the history of
England in the Middle Ages into a tempestuous chronicle of family
feuds and political machinations that reads like a Jacobean drama
crossed with ``Dynasty'' and ``Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little pretense of objectivity in this volume: Norwich
freely pronounces his judgment on individual kings, not to mention
fictional Shakespearean characters, with cool aplomb. Edward II is
dismissed as a contemptible figure who ``reduced the prestige of
the English crown to the lowest point in all its history.'' And
while Norwich credits his son, Edward III, with restoring some
respect to the throne, he adds that the ``last 15 years of his life
had been increasingly clouded by a premature senility.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard II (grandson of Edward III) is chided for a
``combination of fecklessness and arrogance that caused his
downfall.'' And the man who dethroned him, Henry Bolingbroke (Henry
IV), is portrayed as ``a usurper'' who had broken ``his vows of
fealty.'' His reign, Norwich suggests, was one ``long anticlimax,''
with the king becoming, in his last five years, ``a hopeless,
hideously disfigured invalid.''
</P>
<P>
   His son, Henry V _ the former Prince Hal who exchanged the
wayward ways of his youth for pious, even sanctimonious leadership
_ is described as a popular hero, but a ``remarkably indifferent
general'' who ``won a glorious but largely undeserved victory'' and
left ``the country in no better state than he found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry VI, who would lose France, is dismissed as an ``almost
pathetically easily led'' king, ``alarmingly lacking in political
judgment''; and Edward IV, as a decent enough ruler who grew
``prematurely aged by drink and debauch'' and who opened the way
for usurpation by the baleful Richard III.
</P>
<P>
   On the controversial matter of Richard III's villainy, Norwich
comes down firmly against those who hold that he was a
much-maligned monarch, arguing that he was ``a man devoid of
conscience or principle, who would stop at nothing to achieve his
ambition.'' There is little doubt, Norwich argues, that Richard III
was responsible for the murder of the rightful heir to the throne,
12-year-old Edward V, and his younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   So just how accurate were Shakespeare's English history plays?
Norwich's verdict: that ``whatever liberties Shakespeare might take
with strict historical truth, in the essentials he was almost
invariably right.'' Although the Henry VI plays, written when
Shakespeare was still in his 20s, are decidedly less conscientious
than his later plays in hewing to the historical record,
divergences tend to be the result of the playwright's need to
compress vast sweeps of time into a manageable drama. Different
events were sometimes conflated; chronologies, violated; entire
episodes, ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The other reasons Shakespeare departs from the facts, Norwich
observes, have to do with objections from the court censor, a
shortage of actors necessitating the elimination of minor
characters (and the attribution of their actions to others), simple
carelessness, and, most important, the need to make a more dramatic
play. Norwich suggests, for instance, that Shakespeare idealized
the historical John of Gaunt and made him into the grand old man of
his time to create a ``dramatically necessary'' counterpart to the
vapid Richard II. He similarly argues that Shakespeare turned the
unstable Hotspur into a ``young man of dazzling brilliance,
unfailing courage and volcanic energy'' because he saw him as a
potential star.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy enough for the reader to disagree with some of
Norwich's assessments. When he veers off his subject into literary
criticism, for instance, his judgments can be deeply suspect: he
dismisses Falstaff in a phrase or two, as a ``drunken poltroon''
who ``obviously deserves all he gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Such dubious passages, however, do little, in the end, to
detract from Norwich's overall account _ a highly readable account
that one hopes will send readers back to more in-depth studies of
the period, and, of course, to Shakespeare's plays.

THE WORD THAT HAS BEEN BANISHED AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 16)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Certain words and phrases become taboo in the White House.  &UR; Out
of the loop &LR; ,  &UR; amiable dunce &LR; ,  &UR; malaise &LR;  and  &UR; crook &LR;  come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton White House, we are told by Glenn Burkins of The
Wall Street Journal, is eager to make clear that it is ``not being
driven by a quest to establish'' Clinton's  &UR; legacy &LR; . The
interviewer reports that John Podesta, the chief of staff, ``has
banned the use of that word in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the word, in its political sense, is most often
being used in derision. ``The Clintons'  &UR; legacy &LR; ,'' wrote The St.
Petersburg Times as far back as 1996, ``will be the attack and
invasion of our justice system by social entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the columnist Stephen Chapman pronounced,
``Clinton's  &UR; legacy &LR;  is likely to be the enduring diminution of the
office he holds.'' In that year, the New York Times columnist
Maureen Dowd suggested that ``Bill Clinton's biggest  &UR; legacy &LR;  may
not be in politics, but in letters .... He has inspired one
entirely new and remarkable genre: feminist erotic journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   More charitably, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida recently said that
free trade ``is a place where Clinton can legitimately say that he
has a  &UR; legacy &LR; .'' And when asked by a reporter, ``How much of the
president's  &UR; legacy &LR;  is dependent on peace in Ireland and in the
Middle East?'' the White House spokesman Joe Lockhart replied,
``His  &UR; legacy &LR;  will be decided, thankfully, not by us and not by
any of the people who are scribbling in notebooks.''
</P>
<P>
   That official rejection of  &UR; legacy &LR; -itis may have led to the
banning of the word itself in White House usage. Podesta probably
winced when President Clinton, at a recent fund-raising gathering
of American Indians, deplored U.S. negligence of their rights,
adding, ``This is the part of the historical  &UR; legacy &LR;  we want to be
proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it was not in the context of Clinton's own historical
bequest to the American people and could thus not be construed as a
violation of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin  &UR; legare &LR;  means ``to dispute'' and ``to bequeath,''
which is fitting when you consider how many bequests are disputed.
Not in dispute, however, is the 1460 coinage by Robert Henryson,
who writes of a widow's `` &UR; legacy &LR;  and lamentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its ban, watch for what is sure to be the most overused
word of the coming interregnum. An unwanted gift from a
predecessor, parent or older sibling is derogated as a
 &UR; hand-me-down &LR; ; a happier, lasting bequest is called  &UR; a legacy with
legs &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   BOLD INITIATIVE
</P>
<P>
   Readers who enjoyed the exhaustive exegesis in this space of Al
Gore's use of  &UR; risky tax scheme &LR;  were promised a similar study of
favored words of his opponent, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   We have an entry culled from a column by Gail Collins in The New
York Times, wherein my colleague wondered ``whether Gore is right
in charging that the Bush tax plan is `risky,' or Bush is more
correct in dubbing it `bold.'''
</P>
<P>
   As far back as 1997, the governor described his tax plan to the
Texas Legislature as ``this complex,  &UR; bold &LR; , aggressive plan.'' The
Dallas Morning News promptly hailed his `` &UR; bold &LR;  tax plan.'' In a
presidential primary debate in New Hampshire late last year, Bush
described his tax proposal as ``a good,  &UR; bold &LR; , practical plan.''
One of his early competitors, Sen. Orrin Hatch, later saluted the
Bush proposal to reduce taxes by $483 billion over five years as
`` &UR; bold &LR;  but responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's qualifier _ ``but responsible'' _ was intended to strip
any possible riskiness out of the Bush plan (or, as Gore keeps
deriding it, ``scheme''). It indicates the senator's subtle
awareness of the adjective's ability to trouble the easily daunted.
</P>
<P>
   The word, of Teutonic origin and first spelled  &UR; bealde &LR; ,
appeared in Old English about the end of the first millennium.
Shakespeare, in 1593, felt it necessary to place it near a synonym:
``when their brave hope,  &UR; bold &LR;  Hector, marched to field.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as the meaning of ``brave'' took firm hold, Shakespeare
recognized that the word had acquired a different sense, of
``overly audacious, too forward'': In his 1605 ``King Lear,'' he
wrote of ``men so disordered, so deboshed and  &UR; bold &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bold &LR; , applied to a person, today connotes ``pushy,'' sometimes
``fearless,'' but on the edge of ``reckless''; applied to an idea,
however, the connotation is slightly stronger than  &UR; audacious &LR;  and
just short of  &UR; courageous &LR; . It's better to have  &UR; bold &LR;  ideas than
timid ones.
</P>
<P>
   But watch out for cliche fusion: The Dow Jones database spits
out 1,802 hits in the past decade on  &UR; bold initiative &LR; . William
Godwin coined  &UR; initiative &LR;  in 1793 to mean ``the first step in some
enterprise'' and (prefiguring debate in the art world centuries
later) wrote, ``Sensation ... possesses the  &UR; initiative &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The overuse of  &UR; bold &LR;  to modify Godwin's word vitiates its
potency. An alternative to  &UR; initiative &LR;  is  &UR; undertaking &LR; , but that
may have fallen by the wayside as the managers of funerals became
known as  &UR; undertakers &LR; . (They now prefer  &UR; morticians &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bold &LR;  suffered a decline in use for some years ( &UR; brave,
undaunted &LR;  and  &UR; intrepid &LR;  were preferred) but made a comeback in
the great example of the split infinitive of our time: the ``Star
Trek'' plan ``to  &UR; boldly  &LR; go where no man has gone before.'' In
``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' the  &UR; man &LR;  was changed to  &UR; one &LR; ;
that was a  &UR; bold initiative &LR; .

UNIVERSE'S LONGEST TAIL  
 CLEANING UP THE PASTURES  
 FRESH START FOR STOMACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Comet Hyakutake, which was many people's choice for Best
Astronomical Phenomenon of 1996 (Naked Eye Division), has now taken
a new honor: Longest Tail of All Time.
</P>
<P>
   In two studies in the journal Nature, researchers from Britain,
the United States, Switzerland and Germany report that Hyakutake,
which graced the skies for about three months that year, had a tail
that was 350 million miles long, or almost four times the distance
of the Earth from the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   This far outstrips the previous record-holder, the Great March
Comet of 1843, which had a tail that was twice the Earth-Sun
distance.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyakutake measurement was obtained through a happy accident:
the Ulysses spacecraft, launched in 1990 to study the solar wind
from above and below the plane of Earth's orbit, happened to wander
through the tail on May 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On that date, the spacecraft's instruments recorded some odd
measurements, including variations in the structure of the solar
wind's magnetic field. The data eventually led the researchers to
suspect that the spacecraft was within the tail of a comet (a comet
tail consists of gases that have been ionized by solar radiation).
They determined that the comet was Hyakutake by analyzing its
position relative to the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers estimated that at the 350-million-mile distance,
Hyakutake's tail had a cross-section of about four million miles.
Not bad for a dirty piece of ice and rock that is less than two
miles in diameter. The finding also has implications for the
ability of future spacecraft to detect unseen comets. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``Cow pie'' is a quaint term, to be sure, but there is precious
little else that is quaint about cow manure. For one thing, it can
contain strains of E. coli bacteria that, if they get on fruits or
vegetables or in the water supply, can harm people. Composted
manure is generally safe (having been heat-treated by the high
temperatures generated in the composting process), but raw manure
that is spread on fields or gardens as fertilizer can be a source
of E. coli contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Now, scientists at Cornell and the Agricultural Research Service
(part of the federal Department of Agriculture) have found a
promising alternative way to kill microbes in manure. The solution,
they say, is to add sodium carbonate, also known as washing soda.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who reported on their work in the journal
Environmental Science and Technology, made the finding when they
mixed urine and manure. Dairy cows usually produce twice as much
manure as urine, but when the researchers mixed them in equal
amounts they noticed that most of the bacteria in the manure was
eventually killed. They identified carbonate, produced through the
action of an enzyme in the manure on urea in the urine, as the
bacteria-killer.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest that much additional study of the idea
on farms _ not in a lab _ is needed. But they said that adding
sodium carbonate to manure ponds or tanks could ultimately prove to
be an inexpensive way of reducing the bacteria problem. &QL;

   The behavior of the thornback ray, a marine creature found in
European waters, adds new meaning to the term ``gut wrenching.''
According to researchers in Britain, the ray responds to a tainted
meal by rinsing the stomach, extruding it through the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   While people may only (italics)feel(end italics) like their
stomach has been turned inside out after a case of food poisoning,
say, the ray can actually perform such a feat. It then shakes the
stomach from side to side in the water, like a dirty dishrag. This,
the researchers report in Nature, apparently removes indigestible
bits of food or other offending particles. The whole process is
very quick, taking only about four seconds. If you're lucky, you'll
miss it.

   IN THE GENES: Of Thinner People and a Fat-Free Mouse
</P>
<P>
   Scientists think they may now know what makes a mouse head
straight for the cookie jar. Of greater interest to the mouse,
perhaps, they have also figured out a way to let him indulge as
often as he likes and still be able to fit back through his mouse
hole.
</P>
<P>
   In the first case, researchers at an American Chemical Society
conference reported that they were zeroing in on the gene that may
explain why mice are so partial to sweets. In the second,
researchers at the University of Dentistry and Medicine of New
Jersey, writing in the journal Nature Genetics, say they have bred
a genetically modified mouse that can eat without getting fat.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, of course, the researchers' long-term interest is
not mice but people.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists who created the modified mouse stripped away a
gene known as Hgmic, which appears to play a role in helping mice
store fat. Without the gene, the mice could eat with impunity, a
finding that could help lead to drugs that fight obesity in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists on the trail of the ``sweet'' gene in mice are
seeking insight into how the complex sense of taste works in
humans, said Dr. Gary Beauchamp, director of the Monell Chemical
Senses Center, a nonprofit research group in Philadelphia. He said
he was especially intrigued by the universal attraction to
sweet-tasting things, which people are born with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our biology,'' Beauchamp said.
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS: Many in America Are Resigned to Pain
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans are living with pain, and are resigned to
that condition, a new study says.
</P>
<P>
   The Arthritis Foundation reported last week that a Gallup poll
of about 2,000 people found that regular pain was a pervasive part
of American life, but that few people sought medical attention for
it. Sixty percent of those surveyed agreed that pain was ``just
something you have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those adults surveyed, 42 percent reported experiencing pain
every day, and 89 percent said they did so every month. Only half
said they had seen a doctor in the past three years for help with
their pain, and 64 percent said they sought treatment only when the
pain became unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   Pain also affects women disproportionately, and they were 50
percent more likely than men to miss work because of it, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation officials said that people did not seek treatment
because of misconceptions over the inevitability of pain and the
treatments available. The foundation has joined with several other
groups to conduct a national education campaign called ``Speaking
of Pain.''
</P>
<P>
   CONSEQUENCES: Linking Cleft Palates and Smoking Moms
</P>
<P>
   Smoking while pregnant has long been linked to general problems
like premature deliveries and babies with low birth weights, but a
new study reports that it may also be linked to two specific birth
defects: cleft palate and cleft lip.
</P>
<P>
   Even relatively few cigarettes _ 1 to 10 a day _ may increase
the chances that an infant will need surgery to repair an
improperly formed mouth or lip, the researchers say. The study was
reported in a recent issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery,
the journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies had also suggested a link, the researchers said,
but were too small to be definitive. In this case, using 1996 data
from the National Center for Health Statistics, scientists compared
2,207 children born with cleft lips or palates with 4,414 children
born with no congenital abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that women who smoked up to half a pack _ 10
cigarettes _ a day had a 50 percent greater likelihood of giving
birth to a child with the problem than did women who did not smoke.
For women who smoked 11 to 20 cigarettes a day, the figure climbed
to 55 percent, and for women who smoked more than 21 cigarettes, it
was 78 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cleft palates and lips are generally treatable by plastic
surgeons. But the lead author of the study, Dr. Kevin Chung of the
University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, said that
repeated operations were necessary, causing trauma to the children,
and that the birth defects could have lifelong implications for
facial growth, speech and self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scar will always be there, and the speech will always be
different,'' Chung said.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOLOGY: Scans Yield Clues to Early Alzheimer's
</P>
<P>
   As new drugs to treat and even prevent Alzheimer's disease make
their way through the pipeline, a basic medical issue has remained
unresolved: how can doctors know which patients to medicate if they
are not yet showing clear-cut symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers believe they may find an answer in the magnetic
resonance imaging machines. The findings are reported in a new
study paid for by the National Institute on Aging and appearing in
this month's issue of the Annals of Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists found that in patients in the early stages of
Alzheimer's, some regions of the brain change size. When this
happens, the warning signs are clearly visible on an MRI. This may
one day allow doctors to identify patients in early stages of
Alzheimer's who could benefit from drugs as they become available.
But, the lead researcher, Dr. Marilyn Albert of Massachusetts
General Hospital, cautioned that the technique needed much
refinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not there yet,'' she said, ``and I don't want to mislead
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers _ who are also from Brigham and Women's Hospital
and from Harvard, Brandeis and Boston Universities _ were able to
confirm earlier studies that found significant neuron loss in some
parts of the brain during early Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Over three years, the researchers studied 119 people with an
average age in the early '70s, some healthy and some with mild
memory problems. As subjects developed the disease, the researchers
went back and reviewed their earlier MRI's.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, they reported, the MRI could distinguish between
healthy participants and those with mild Alzheimer's. In 93 percent
of the cases, they said, MRI scans of the entorhinal cortex could
detect a difference between healthy people and memory-impaired
patients who went on to develop the disease.
</P>
<P>
   TREATMENTS: Zooming In on Tumors, With Magnets
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe they may have found an unusual new tool,
magnets, to help in the war against cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy treatments,
scientists at the University of California at Los Angeles attached
the anticancer drug doxorubicin to microscopic particles of a
magnetic material. They then used a much larger magnet to help
concentrate the medicine at the site of the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   The technique was reported at a recent conference in San Diego
of the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology. Dr.
Scott Goodwin, the chief of vascular and interventional radiology
at the UCLA Medical Center, told the conference that the method
seemed to limit the medicine's spread through the body.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors do not know yet whether using magnets will
increase the potency of the drugs, they say there was a significant
decrease in unpleasant side effects like nausea and hair loss.

`TALK TO ME' MAKES ABC LOOK REALLY, REALLY DUMB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: D  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As satire, ``Talk to Me'' is brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   But word on the street is that it's not satire. It's supposed to
be funny in the straight-on, ha-ha sense, not in the wink-wink,
nudge-nudge sense.
</P>
<P>
   Pity. If it were poking fun at situation comedy, critics would
be singing hosannas. Instead, that sound you hear is wailing, and
possibly even some gnashing of teeth, brought on by ABC's
unbelievable, monumental, criminally negligent stupidity at taking
``Sports Night'' off the air in favor of this piece of uninspired
offal.
</P>
<P>
   Surely someone at ABC knows this show is dreadful. Or is
everyone over there so caught up in the success of ``Who Wants To
Be a Millionaire'' that no one is screening the rest of the stuff
being extruded from the back room where they keep Regis Philbin's
dark shirts?
</P>
<P>
   There's no good reason for ``Talk to Me'' to be on the air.
Period. It is not funny. It is not imaginative. And, as comedy sets
go, it is not even all that pleasant to look at.
</P>
<P>
   Kyra Sedgwick, apparently a graduate of the Trying Too Hard
School of Comedy, is the star of this dud. She also is one of five
executive producers, which may help explain why it's such a mess.
Sedgwick plays Janey Munro, the irreverent, wise-cracking host of a
radio talk show in New York City. She has a couple of studio
sidekicks, a wacky sibling, and if this is starting to sound like a
female facsimile of ``Frasier,'' you're more astute than the folks
at ABC, who evidently don't watch much TV. (The show's creator,
Suzanne Martin, is a former ``Frasier'' hand.)
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that Janey's life away from the station provides
the material for her show, so in tonight's premiere we see her
trying to deal with a recent breakup by ``taking it like a man.''
Next week, she dabbles in homosexuality, just to make sure she's
not missing something by taking it from a woman. On someone else's
show, both episodes might be amusing, but on ``Talk to Me'' they're
more offensive than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Guest stars who used to be famous _ Gene Simmons tonight,
Paulina Porizkova next week _ add that special sense of
desperation. Beverly D'Angelo, as a socially conservative
psychologist-of-the-air and Janey's nemesis, adds the crowning
touch of someone who looks about as comfortable in this project as
a Republican on ``The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance of ``MAD TV'' alumna Nicole Sullivan, who plays
Janey's unemployed sister, Kat, is the funniest thing about ``Talk
to Me,'' which might be a lesson for ABC: Instead of casting
big-name actresses in a comedy, try hiring funny ones.
</P>
<P>
   `Fail Safe' not a failure
</P>
<P>
   It helps to have been a child of the Cold War, but CBS's
``live'' broadcast of ``Fail Safe'' Sunday night was the sort of
theater TV used to be famous for and that viewers of any age should
applaud.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it wasn't perfect. Lines were flubbed, camera shots seemed
oddly selected and some of the acting _ e.g., Harvey Keitel's _ was
overwrought. But other performances, most notably Brian Dennehy's
as Gen. Bogan, Hank Azzaria's as a scary academician and Sam
Elliott's as a bombastic congressman, were on the mark, proving
that while live dramatic television is indeed a crap shoot it is
something worth encouraging as networks look for new and different
ways to attract viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer/star George Clooney chose ``Fail Safe''
because the original 1964 film about the erroneous deployment of a
U.S. Air Force nuclear-bomber squadron over the Soviet Union is his
favorite movie, and he wanted something that fit the look and feel
of 1950s live television.
</P>
<P>
   I'd call it a qualified success. Ideas for next time: Forget
black and white; pick a more timely topic.
</P>
<P>
   Odds 'n' ends
</P>
<P>
   OK, ABC isn't completely stupid. It has renewed ``Once and
Again,'' a drama about relationships after divorce, for next
season. ``The Practice'' and ``NYPD Blue'' also will be back for a
fifth and eighth season, respectively. ... ``NYPD Blue'' will have
to get along without Andrea Thompson, who is leaving the series
after this season to try her hand as a news anchor at KRQE-TV in
Albuquerque. Thompson, who plays Detective Jill Kirkendall, has no
journalism experience. ... NBC has renewed ``The West Wing'' for a
second season. ... This year's fall season will begin later than
normal because of the Summer Olympics. Nielsen Media Research, the
company that measures TV viewership, says it will start the fall
season no sooner than Oct. 2 _ a victory for every network except
NBC, which is televising the Olympics and hoped to use the expected
ratings surge as a fall springboard. But Nielsen decided it was
fairer to have the Olympics coverage, scheduled Sept. 15 to Oct. 1,
to fall outside fall.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Me. Half-hour comedy series about an irreverent radio
talk-show host. Starring Kyra Sedgwick, Nicole Sullivan, Max Baker,
David Newsom, Mike Estime, Peter Jacobson and Beverly D'Angelo.
Series premiere Tuesday night on ABC. Parental guideline rating:
TV-PG.

PERSONAL HEALTH: BREAKING THE CYCLE OF SEASONAL SNEEZES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are you filled with dread instead of delight about the arrival
of spring, anticipating the sneezes, runny nose and itchy eyes that
are the hallmarks of seasonal allergic rhinitis? Well, suffer no
more. There is now a wide array of treatments, over the counter and
prescription, that can suppress the annoying symptoms of spring
(and fall) allergies, which can interfere with sleep, work and
enjoyment of life and increase your vulnerability to colds,
sinusitis and other respiratory infections.
</P>
<P>
   You are hardly alone. Ten to 30 percent of Americans are
allergic to wind-swept pollen from trees, grasses, weeds and/or
molds. In spring, you can blame such trees as alder, ash, birch,
cedar, elm, hazel, maple, oak, olive, pecan, sycamore and walnut.
In summer, common allergens include grasses like timothy, ryegrass,
Bermuda grass, English plantain and sheep sorrel. And, of course,
there's fall, with pollen from ragweed, sage and Russian thistle
the common culprits.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the allergy season is year-round, the result of
continuous contact with mold spores, dust mites, feathers, pet
dander or cigarette smoke. But whether your symptoms are seasonal
or perennial, there is now likely to be an effective treatment that
can curb your misery with a minimum of side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Allergies are signs of an immune system run amok. Instead of
attacking only the body's enemies, it mounts an all-out assault
against innocent substances called allergens, which are almost
always proteins. In tissues that have contact with the outside
world (like the lining of the nose and breathing tubes and eyes),
mast cells that are storehouses of histamine and other protective
chemicals spew forth their ammunition when ``danger'' strikes in
the form of an allergen to which you are sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   The mast cells are ``told'' to begin their attacks by antibodies
called IgE, which the body mistakenly produces when exposed to
particular allergens. Unlike most other short-lived antibodies, IgE
antibodies can hang around for years, ready to set off an allergic
response the next time you are exposed to that same allergen.
</P>
<P>
   The cascade of histamine and other substances cause itching,
sneezing and runny nose, usually within minutes of exposure to the
offending allergen. As if that were not bothersome enough, some 6
to 12 hours later come the delayed symptoms: nasal congestion and a
heightened sensitivity to the particular allergen and to irritants
like scents and tobacco smoke.
</P>
<P>
   You can minimize your exposure to troublesome airborne allergens
by keeping windows closed, using air-conditioning at home and in
the car, showering and washing your hair nightly, staying indoors
when pollen counts are high, wearing glasses outdoors, finding
someone else to cut the lawn and hedges and using a high-efficiency
air cleaner in the rooms where you spend the most time (especially
the bedroom). If such measures are not possible or are inadequate
at keeping your allergic symptoms at bay, there is a veritable army
of treatments you might try.
</P>
<P>
   NASAL SPRAY _ Cromolyn sodium, sold over the counter as
Nasalcrom, is a highly effective nonsteroidal drug that can stop
nasal allergic reactions before they start by stabilizing mast
cells and preventing the release of histamine. Start using it
before allergy season and continue until exposure to the offending
allergens has ended. It is extremely safe, even for children,
pregnant women and the elderly, but it is underused, probably
because it must be administered four to six times a day for maximum
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Intranasal corticosteroids are also seriously underused,
according to doctors who specialize in allergy treatment. These
safe and effective sprays are considered the most potent weapons
against allergic rhinitis, and because they are used topically,
they do not cause symptoms associated with oral or injected
steroids. Popular products, which are available only by
prescription, include Flonase, Nasonex and Rhinocort-AQ, which need
to be used only once a day.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment with nasal steroids is best started now, before
allergy season is in full bloom. These drugs combat the delayed
response of nasal congestion as well as itching, sneezing and runny
nose. They do not, however, always relieve itchy eyes. Their main
side effect is nasal irritation, which can be prevented by spraying
straight up toward the sinuses, avoiding exposure to the nasal
lining as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology warns
against the use of steroid injections for seasonal allergies.
Although these injections provide relief for weeks, they are far
more hazardous than the nasal sprays.
</P>
<P>
   Other nasal products include Atrovent, which can dry up a runny
nose but has no effect on other allergy symptoms, and saline nasal
sprays (Ocean, NaSal and Salinex), useful in relieving nasal
congestion and sneezing. But avoid using nasal sprays containing
oxymetazoline (Afrin, for example) for more than three days because
longer use can cause rebound congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIHISTAMINES _ As you would guess from the name, these drugs
block the action of histamine and thus are most effective if taken
preventively, before you develop allergic symptoms. Older products
like Dimetane, Chlor-Trimeton and Tavist are available over the
counter. These nonprescription drugs tend to induce drowsiness,
though less so than diphenhydramine, which is the main ingredient
in Benadryl. To counter the sedating effects and to combat nasal
congestion, some of these products are sold in combination with a
decongestant like pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine, which act
as stimulants.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, the newer prescription antihistamines like
Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec, all now available as once-a-day
pills, rarely cause sedation or any other side effect. In addition,
there is a low-dose Allegra and Claritin syrup for children ages 6
and older. But these nonsedating antihistamines have not been
tested for safety during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Also available are antihistamine drops for the eyes (Livostin, a
prescription product, and Vasocon-A and Naphacon-A, both sold over
the counter), Cromolon (a prescription product that prevents
histamine release) and anti-inflammatory eye drops like Acular,
sold over the counter. However, avoid eye drops that ``get the red
out''; these contain blood-vessel constrictors (naphazoline,
ephedrine, phenylephrine and tetrahydrozoline), which dry the eyes
and can cause rebound redness.
</P>
<P>
   DECONGESTANTS _ These drugs (pseudoephedrine and
phenylpropalomine) are sold without a prescription. They can
relieve nasal congestion but do not stop runny noses, sneezing or
itching. Possible side effects include jitteriness, rapid heart
rate, insomnia and elevated blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   IMMUNOTHERAPY _ If the allergens to which you are sensitive can
be well defined, weekly allergy shots for three to five years can
bring prolonged relief and reduce or even eliminate the need for
additional medication. But even with such protection, it is wise to
avoid exposure to the allergens as much as possible.

SAVING LIGHT, OR WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What is the rationale behind daylight saving time? You can't
really ``save'' daylight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The chief practical reason for setting the clock an hour
later for a certain period of the year, so that the sun sets later
by the clock, is not to ``save'' daylight, but to make daylight
hours coincide more closely with the time when most people use
energy.
</P>
<P>
   A major effect of daylight time is that it leaves more hours of
natural light at the end of the day, reducing the time between
sunset and the typical bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy use and the demand for electricity for lighting our
homes is directly connected to when we go to bed and when we get
up,'' according to the California Department of Energy. ``Bedtime
for most of us is late evening through the year. When we go to bed,
we turn off the lights and TV.''
</P>
<P>
   In the average home, the department estimates, 25 percent of all
electricity use is for lighting and small appliances, like
televisions, VCRs and stereos.
</P>
<P>
   Studies done in the 1970s by the U.S. Department of
Transportation found that the country's electricity usage went down
by about 1 percent each day of daylight saving time.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have suggested that the time shift be extended or
even kept all year, as has occasionally been done during wars or
energy crises.
</P>
<P>
   But the savings depends on having people set their bedtimes and
rising times by the clock, not the sun. &QL;

A HIT MOVIE IS RATED `F' IN SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By GINA KOLATA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It should be no surprise to viewers of the hit movie ``Erin
Brockovich'' that the science portrayed in the movie is not really
science. After all, this is a major motion picture coming out of
Hollywood. It comes from a fairy tale land where women are
abnormally beautiful, men are lusciously handsome, where sex is
unusually profligate and violence casual and frequent.
</P>
<P>
   So if audiences are willing to suspend disbelief in every other
arena, why should anyone care about something so dull as the
veracity of the scientific methodology?
</P>
<P>
   Yet many scientists are offended by the movie, and it is worth
asking why. The problem, they say, is not that they cannot enjoy a
good yarn in which virtue triumphs over evil and the little guys
win. It is not that they want to take sides in this litigation from
years past. Their complaint is more subtle: While it is easy to see
that the sex and violence in movies are fantasies, it is hard for
any but scientists to discern when science in movies crosses the
line from verity to hyperbole and indoctrination.
</P>
<P>
   And when the movie is based on a true story about a woman who
really is named Erin Brockovich, the questions of what is real and
what is not become further muddled. Scientists suspect that
audiences will decide that the fiction is that Erin Brockovich does
not actually look like Julia Roberts, who plays her, but that they
will assume that the science, of course, is fact.
</P>
<P>
   That, to many scientists, is a tragedy that spoils the movie. In
science, how you reach a conclusion really matters. It is hard for
scientists to enjoy watching a movie that ignores, as though it is
irrelevant, the hard-won but ultimately glorious knowledge of how
to decide when perceived risks are real and when they are not.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Brockovich is a law office file clerk with a high
school education who stumbles upon a group of people in Hinkley,
Calif, who have been visited by a Job-like plague of ailments.
Their illnesses include uterine cancer, breast cancer, Hodgkin's
disease, cancer of the brain stem, gastrointestinal cancer,
miscarriages, chronic nosebleeds, asthma, heart failure and immune
system disorders.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the groundwater in Hinkley was polluted with
trace amounts of chromium (VI), a heavy metal. The polluter was
Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, the case was clear. As Brockovich in the movie
gathered medical histories from more than 600 Hinkley residents,
she never seemed to doubt that every ailment was caused by chromium
(VI). In the end, Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric paid $333 million to
settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   But, scientists said, the movie encouraged exactly the wrong way
to think about data, elevating individuals' medical histories to
the level of proof and distorting the notion of risk. Scientists,
seeing the evidence that so infuriated Brockovich, would be much
more cautious _ and skeptical. The first question to ask is whether
residents of Hinkley really did have more sickness than people
living elsewhere. And, if so, what illnesses are being discussed?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has symptoms,'' said Dr. John C. Bailar III, a
professor of health studies at the University of Chicago. Half the
adult population eventually gets cancer. One out of every 700
children gets cancer before age 15, he said. Vague complaints, like
aches and pains and difficulty sleeping are ubiquitous. If people
look for diseases, they will find them.
</P>
<P>
   The next red flag is the sheer number of diseases. ``Any time I
see half a dozen diseases attributed to some exposure, I get very
nervous,'' Bailar said. Biological agents, he said, ``are very well
targeted.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinyl chloride has been shown to cause liver cancer, but not
asthma. Asbestos has been shown to cause lung cancer, but not
breast cancer or brain cancer. The list of illnesses that any
chemical is known to cause is very short, said Dr. Stephen Safe, a
toxicologist at Texas A&AMP;M University. ``The list is not 10,000
diseases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists would also ask if it is even plausible that chromium
(VI) in drinking water was making hundreds of people gravely ill.
Of course, both sides in the litigation that ensued over the
Hinkley groundwater contamination brought in their own scientific
experts, although that was not pursued in the movie, but federal
agencies whose scientists were not involved in the litigation said
evidence was lacking that chromium (VI) in groundwater caused a
myriad of health problems. The chemical's main problem, they said,
is that it can cause lung cancer if workers inhale it as
particulates in large doses for long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lois Swirsky Gold, who directs the carcinogenic potency
project at the University of California at Berkeley, notes that
Erin Brockovich is billed as fiction. So she has one wish for its
audiences. ``They should ask, does the science support the
conclusion?'' she said.

   KOREA-TALKS (Seoul, South Korea) _ An unusual catalog of
emotions _ shock, relief, wariness _ were on display on Monday as
Koreans learned that their country's president would travel to
North Korea in June for the first-ever summit with his communist
counterpart. One reaction, nearly universal, was shock that a
meeting that few had imagined possible had been successfully
negotiated in secret. In almost every case, the surprise was
followed with a happy sense of relief that the Cold War might
finally be ending in one of its final redoubts. Then came the
practical question, asked by almost all: what will it cost us? By
Howard W. French.

<P>
   PERU-ELECT (Lima, Peru) _ As the government vote count suggested
that President Alberto Fujimori is close to winning an outright
re-election victory in Sunday's balloting, international election
observers expressed grave concerns Monday over the way the
government handled ballot boxes and vote tally sheets as well as in
the slowness of the official vote tally. Crying that fraud was
already being committed, Fujimori's main opponent, Alejandro
Toledo, led tens of thousands of people late Sunday night in a
march on the presidential palace demanding that the will of the
people be respected. The crowd was dispersed in the predawn hours
today by policemen firing tear gas, but opposition leaders said a
denial of a second round would bring a mass civil disobedience
campaign that would make the country ungovernable. By Clifford

   CHINA-EMBASSY-U.S. (Washington) _ China on Monday rejected the

Belgrade during NATO's air war against Yugoslavia and again
demanded a ``thorough and comprehensive'' investigation, but
American officials declared the matter closed. A spokesman for
China's Foreign Ministry in Beijing, Zhu Bangzao, criticized the
CIA's dismissal of a mid-level officer blamed for the attack as
inadequate and reiterated China's demands that the Clinton
administration ``punish those responsible.'' By Steven Lee Myers.

   RAMPAGE-KILLERS-III (Salt Lake City) _ With the voices inside
her head ordering her to kill, Lisa Duy walked into Doug's Shoot'n
Sports here to buy a semiautomatic pistol. The manager, Dave
Larsen, ran a background check on her and the agency quickly
approved the sale, having found no record of felony convictions or
mental illness. The only thing unusual, Larsen thought, was that as
she left the store, Duy was wearing the shooting-range ear
protectors he had lent her. Less than two hours later, on Jan. 14,
1999, Duy, ear protectors still in place, walked into the studios
of television station KSL and began firing her new weapon. She shot
more than four dozen times in all, killing a young mother and
wounding the building manager. What the background check had been
unable to detect was that Duy had a long history of psychiatric
problems. Of the 100 episodes of rampage killings examined for this
series by The New York Times, none better illustrates than the case
of Lisa Duy just how difficult it can be to enforce a key provision
of the nation's fundamental gun control law. That provision
prohibits people who have been involuntarily committed to mental
institutions from buying a handgun. But laws in most states guard
the privacy of the mentally ill, so gun background checks typically
fail to turn up mental health histories. By Fox Butterfield.

   &UR; BY DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four years after Helen Gurley Brown was pushed out as
Cosmopolitan's editor, the superannuated ``girl'' is in the news
again. She is making the media rounds to flog her new memoir, ``I'm
Wild Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown appears on its cover in a slinky, fire-engine-red dress.
She reveals that she was briefly a Hollywood mogul's kept woman in
the late '40s. She gloats that she got breast implants five years
ago -- when she was 73. She repeats her favorite aphorism: ``Sex is
one of the three best things we have, and I don't know the other
two.''
</P>
<P>
   She mentions her office-wall motto: ``Good Girls Go to Heaven,
Bad Girls Go Everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Wild Again,'' in short, would seem to cement Brown's
reputation as a retrograde sex monkey, a Cosmo girl who has
graduated to her twilight years just as daffily sex-crazed and
man-centric as she was a generation (or two, or three) ago.
</P>
<P>
   But on closer inspection, ``I'm Wild Again'' is a strangely
inapt title and a poor description of Brown's life. She's not wild
again (and she may never have been very wild in the first place).
This is the autobiography of a puritan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild'' chronicles how Brown exercises obsessively; doesn't
drink, smoke, or eat; has remained utterly faithful to her husband
of 35 years; and lives for her job. The Cosmo girl's dirty little
secret isn't sex. It's work.
</P>
<P>
   In the popular imagination, Helen Gurley Brown is a Holly
Golightly character, an insouciant cutie-pie, existentially
concerned with having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Cosmo girl is actually a different sort of
American icon: the ruthless, self-made woman. She is Sister Carrie,
channeled through Bridget Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, an Arkansas state legislator, was killed in an
elevator accident when she was 10. Her mother sank into poverty and
sadness. Her older sister was crippled by polio.
</P>
<P>
   Brown did what any ambitious young thing would: She got the hell
out, shed her hillbilly roots, and reinvented herself. For a
decade, she worked as a sweater-girl secretary in Los Angeles. Her
moxie, wit and hard work eventually won her a job writing ad copy.
After years of swinging singlehood, she landed her man, movie
producer David Brown, in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband urged her to chronicle her bachelorette days, and
she did. When ``Sex and the Single Girl'' came out in 1962, Brown
-- by then a hardly girlish 40 -- became a national sensation. She
was booed and bombed with tomatoes at public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   But the best seller made her, according to Gloria Steinem, a
feminist ``pioneer.'' Published a year before Betty Friedan's ``The
Feminine Mystique,'' ``Sex'' told girls they didn't have to marry,
they could have sex, and they could enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very astounding news in 1962,'' says Barbara
Ehrenreich. (Brown may be the godmother of the contemporary sexpert
industry. ``Sex and the City'' seems to owe much -- including
perhaps its title -- to Brown.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Brown, who had never edited, was offered the helm of
the struggling Cosmopolitan. It had been a serious magazine, a
would-be Saturday Evening Post, but Brown gutted it and invented
the modern women's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Her formula: a busty, hookerish-looking cover model, sexy cover
lines (''Men Who Fake Orgasm''), and a lot of steam inside (Burt
Reynolds, naked!). The Cosmo Web site sums up the magazine's
enduring vision: ``Land that man, ace your job, and look your
sexiest ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosmo thrived, but Brown's political cachet vanished. Feminists
who had admired ``Sex and the Single Girl'' deplored Brown's
failure to advance. Cosmo seemed dedicated to the proposition that
girls should live for men. ``Having a man is 50 percent of
living,'' Brown counseled. ``Never refuse to make love, even if you
don't feel like it,'' she recommended in her 1982 best seller,
``Having It All.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics dismissed Cosmo as ``bitchcraft.'' Betty Friedan called
it ``quite obscene and quite horrible. It embraces the idea that a
woman is nothing but a sex object.'' In the '90s, Brown enraged
many lefties by endorsing sexual harassment and defending Clarence
Thomas and Bob Packwood. A little sexual tension in the office, she
said, never hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's critics noticed her deplorable sexual politics but
missed the rest of the package. Beneath the veneer of sex talk and
seduction advice was steel. Brown was not teaching girls to be
geishas. She was teaching them to be bosses. ``Get out and do it,
kiddo!'' she urged.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says that she made Cosmo for ``mouseburgers'' like
herself, ``23-year-olds with their nose pressed against the glass''
who learned how to make the best with what they had. Brown barraged
them with sound advice: Work hard, be punctual, be tough, don't
fear competition, save your money. (Cosmo was Erin Brockovich
before Erin Brockovich: Dress like a slut, work like a champ.
Indeed, much of the criticism directed at Cosmo is sneery elitism.
It skews to a less swank demo than Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. Its
readers are beauticians and secretaries, not lawyers, and its
fashions tend toward cheap knockoffs.)
</P>
<P>
   Brown and her magazine inspired because she had lived her own
advice. Brown may have encouraged cavorting with married men, but
she was too busy to do it herself. She was working 12-hour days on
the magazine. She was and is relentlessly self-improving. At 78,
she still exercises twice a day and lives a life of ``controlled
deprivation.'' (In a 78-year-old male boss, this would be seen as
tough and sexy. But when Brown does it, she is unfairly ridiculed
as a sex-crazed, anorexic old bat.)
</P>
<P>
   Brown's intensity paid off for Cosmo, boosting its circulation
from three-quarters-of-a-million to 3 million. (Today, circulation
has subsided slightly to 2.7 million, still more than any other
young women's magazine.)
</P>
<P>
   At the time she left, Cosmo was earning Hearst a stupendous $50
million per year. Her Cosmo changed the women's mag trade: Its
competitors now imitate Brown's sexy cover lines and models.
</P>
<P>
   When she was pink-slipped at Cosmo in 1996, Brown, typically,
did not slink into pampered retirement. She became editor of
Cosmopolitan's 39 overseas editions. All of them are in the black.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to ridicule Brown but hard to dislike her. She has
tremendous panache. Her writing effervesces. In ``I'm Wild Again,''
she dryly notes the absence of anti-Semitism when she was growing
up in Jim Crow Arkansas: ``We were pretty busy with Apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   She describes giving bad news to someone: It ``went down like
chopped stone dragon.'' On getting breast cancer, she jokes: ``I
had cancer, doesn't everyone?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown may be funny, but she is not exactly warm. She doesn't
like children and never had any: They are ``competitors'' for
attention. In ``Wild,'' she repeatedly describes her techniques for
pretending to listen. She dismisses her father with a parenthetical
note and takes care of her mother and crippled sister in a handful
of pages.
</P>
<P>
   Brown today is perceived as an artifact, because she is
(supposedly) devoted to a philosophy that is not only wrong but
archaic: Women should live to get men. In fact, Brown's own life
reflects a sin that is much more modern -- and, in self-help
America, much more forgivable -- than the one she is accused of.
She is not too interested in pleasing men. She is too interested in
pleasing herself.

&HT;     THE SHORT AND SKINNY ON THE NFL DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPAKCER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With next weekend's NFL draft, you will be
hearing an awful lot about such former student-athletes as LaVar
Arrington, Courtney Brown, Peter Warrick and Chris Samuels.
</P>
<P>
   In most mock drafts, these will be the first four players
chosen, though not necessarily in that order.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the draft is top-heavy in big names and deadly
numbers but light in more compelling areas of interest such as how
many 25-year-old married men will be taken this year? Which draft
pick will incur the wrath of that fat guy in the Jets jersey and
hardhat with a plastic jet glued to the top?
</P>
<P>
   These answers may help:
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   The numbers game
</P>
<P>
   HEAVIEST: Stockar McDougle, T, Oklahoma, 361 pounds. ``He's a
load-and-a-half,'' said Terry Donahue, the San Francisco 49ers'
director of personnel. ``He might be two loads.''
</P>
<P>
   LIGHTEST: Cornell Craig, WR, Southern Illinois, 165 pounds.
Stretched out on a 6-foot frame, he's downright spindly.
</P>
<P>
   TALLEST: Todd Wade, T, Mississippi, 6-8. His father and
grandfather both played for Ole Miss, so in 2025 we should expect
to see Todd's son lining up for the Rebels.
</P>
<P>
   SHORTEST: Troy Walters, WR, Stanford, 5-6 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   FASTEST: Melvin Harris, C, Virginia, 4.32 seconds for 40 yards.
Of course, all football 40 times are bogus, but since the same
inexact standards are applied to all, it doesn't really matter.
</P>
<P>
   SLOWEST: Jonathan Gray, T, Texas Tech, 5.85 for the 40. At that
rate, it would take him three years to run the Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   STRONGEST: Leif Larsen, DT, UTEP, 45 repetitions of 225 pounds
in the bench press.
</P>
<P>
   SMARTEST: QB Todd Husak, Stanford, and CB Ahmed Plummer, Ohio
State, each scored 39 out of 50 on the Wonderlic test of
intelligence given to all players at the scouting combine.
</P>
<P>
   DUMB AND DUMBER: The lowest Wonderlic score at the combine was 4
turned in by a Midwest running back who shall remain nameless.
</P>
<P>
   LONGEST NON-HYPHENATED SURNAME: Ryan Johanningmeier, OL,
Colorado. Good thing he's a 310-pounder. That name would never fit
on the back of a little guy's jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Career men
</P>
<P>
   GIVE THIS MAN A JOB: Offensive lineman Manuia Savea of Arizona
is 25, married and has three children.
</P>
<P>
   PROBABLY DID WELL ON THE INTELLIGENCE TESTS: LB Isiah Kacyvenski
is the only Harvard player listed in the draft guides. One such
said he is ``smart'' and ``has many off-the-field options.'' No
kidding.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   What's in a name?
</P>
<P>
   CRIME WAVE QUARTET: Cedrick Killings (DT, Carson-Newman), T.J.
Slaughter (LB, Southern Miss), Tramont Lawless (LB, Memphis),
Ainsley Battles (CB, Vanderbilt)
</P>
<P>
   GOOD MANNERS DEPT.: Dextra Polite (CB, Clemson), Sherrod Peace
(DE, North Carolina)
</P>
<P>
   YOU MEAN VERTICALLY CHALLENGED: Anthony Midget (CB, Virginia
Tech)
</P>
<P>
   WHERE'S THE FIRE?: Earthwind Moreland (CB, Georgia Southern)
</P>
<P>
   FUN SURNAME TO SAY OVER AND OVER: Shannon Poppinga (CB,
Augustana)
</P>
<P>
   GEOGRAPHICALLY CORRECT: Brad St. Louis (TE, Southwest Missouri
St.)
</P>
<P>
   OPPOSITE OF APPLAUSE: Boo Williams (RB, South Carolina), Carlton
Booe (RB, Northeastern Oklahoma)
</P>
<P>
   TO THE SWIFT: Antonio Speed (LB, Valdosta State), Joey Goodspeed
(FB, Notre Dame)
</P>
<P>
   DROP THE CHALUPA: Chris Chaloupka (QB, Sam Houston St.)
</P>
<P>
   ISN'T HE ON ``THE SOPRANOS''?: Giovanni Carmazzi (QB, Hofstra)
</P>
<P>
   MUST BE A FAMILY NAME: Plaxico Burress (WR, Michigan State),
Laveranues Coles (WR, Florida State)
</P>
<P>
   SHOULD HAVE BEEN A QB: Patrick Pass (RB, Georgia)
</P>
<P>
   BEST OF THE REST: Spergon Wynn (QB, Southwest Texas), Kofi Shuck
(WR, Wyoming), Imani Percoats (WR, Oregon State), Shockmain Davis
(WR, Angelo State), Jacques Rumph (WR, Carson-Newman), Trung
Canidate (RB, Arizona), Thaddeus Variance (RB, New Mexico

she did. When ``Sex and the Single Girl'' came out in 1962, Brown
-- by then a hardly girlish 40 -- became a national sensation. She
was booed and bombed with tomatoes at public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   But the best seller made her, according to Gloria Steinem, a
feminist ``pioneer.'' Published a year before Betty Friedan's ``The
Feminine Mystique,'' ``Sex'' told girls they didn't have to marry,
they could have sex, and they could enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very astounding news in 1962,'' says Barbara
Ehrenreich. (Brown may be the godmother of the contemporary sexpert
industry. ``Sex and the City'' seems to owe much -- including
perhaps its title -- to Brown.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Brown, who had never edited, was offered the helm of
the struggling Cosmopolitan. It had been a serious magazine, a
would-be Saturday Evening Post, but Brown gutted it and invented
the modern women's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Her formula: a busty, hookerish-looking cover model, sexy cover
lines (''Men Who Fake Orgasm''), and a lot of steam inside (Burt
Reynolds, naked!). The Cosmo Web site sums up the magazine's
enduring vision: ``Land that man, ace your job, and look your
sexiest ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosmo thrived, but Brown's political cachet vanished. Feminists
who had admired ``Sex and the Single Girl'' deplored Brown's
failure to advance. Cosmo seemed dedicated to the proposition that
girls should live for men. ``Having a man is 50 percent of
living,'' Brown counseled. ``Never refuse to make love, even if you
don't feel like it,'' she recommended in her 1982 best seller,
``Having It All.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics dismissed Cosmo as ``bitchcraft.'' Betty Friedan called
it ``quite obscene and quite horrible. It embraces the idea that a
woman is nothing but a sex object.'' In the '90s, Brown enraged
many lefties by endorsing sexual harassment and defending Clarence
Thomas and Bob Packwood. A little sexual tension in the office, she
said, never hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's critics noticed her deplorable sexual politics but
missed the rest of the package. Beneath the veneer of sex talk and
seduction advice was steel. Brown was not teaching girls to be
geishas. She was teaching them to be bosses. ``Get out and do it,
kiddo!'' she urged.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says that she made Cosmo for ``mouseburgers'' like
herself, ``23-year-olds with their nose pressed against the glass''
who learned how to make the best with what they had. Brown barraged
them with sound advice: Work hard, be punctual, be tough, don't
fear competition, save your money. (Cosmo was Erin Brockovich
before Erin Brockovich: Dress like a slut, work like a champ.
Indeed, much of the criticism directed at Cosmo is sneery elitism.
It skews to a less swank demo than Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. Its
readers are beauticians and secretaries, not lawyers, and its
fashions tend toward cheap knockoffs.)
</P>
<P>
   Brown and her magazine inspired because she had lived her own
advice. Brown may have encouraged cavorting with married men, but
she was too busy to do it herself. She was working 12-hour days on
the magazine. She was and is relentlessly self-improving. At 78,
she still exercises twice a day and lives a life of ``controlled
deprivation.'' (In a 78-year-old male boss, this would be seen as
tough and sexy. But when Brown does it, she is unfairly ridiculed
as a sex-crazed, anorexic old bat.)
</P>
<P>
   Brown's intensity paid off for Cosmo, boosting its circulation
from three-quarters-of-a-million to 3 million. (Today, circulation
has subsided slightly to 2.7 million, still more than any other
young women's magazine.)
</P>
<P>
   At the time she left, Cosmo was earning Hearst a stupendous $50
million per year. Her Cosmo changed the women's mag trade: Its
competitors now imitate Brown's sexy cover lines and models.
</P>
<P>
   When she was pink-slipped at Cosmo in 1996, Brown, typically,
did not slink into pampered retirement. She became editor of
Cosmopolitan's 39 overseas editions. All of them are in the black.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to ridicule Brown but hard to dislike her. She has
tremendous panache. Her writing effervesces. In ``I'm Wild Again,''
she dryly notes the absence of anti-Semitism when she was growing
up in Jim Crow Arkansas: ``We were pretty busy with Apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   She describes giving bad news to someone: It ``went down like
chopped stone dragon.'' On getting breast cancer, she jokes: ``I
had cancer, doesn't everyone?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown may be funny, but she is not exactly warm. She doesn't
like children and never had any: They are ``competitors'' for
attention. In ``Wild,'' she repeatedly describes her techniques for
pretending to listen. She dismisses her father with a parenthetical
note and takes care of her mother and crippled sister in a handful
of pages.
</P>
<P>
   Brown today is perceived as an artifact, because she is
(supposedly) devoted to a philosophy that is not only wrong but
archaic: Women should live to get men. In fact, Brown's own life
reflects a sin that is much more modern -- and, in self-help
America, much more forgivable -- than the one she is accused of.
She is not too interested in pleasing men. She is too interested in
pleasing herself.

MEDICARE TO RUN DIET EXPERIMENT FOR CRITICALLY ILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Pa.)   (Science Times)  
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eva Hebenstreit remembers a trip to Israel in January 1986, when
her 71-year-old husband, Werner, could not get across the street
before the light changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a cripple,'' said Hebenstreit. ``A permanent coronary
cripple.''
</P>
<P>
   At his doctor's recommendation, Hebenstreit, who had had two
heart attacks, joined a program run by Dr. Dean Ornish, who for
more than 20 years has studied whether changes in diet and daily
activities can reverse coronary heart disease. It was a radical
program combining an extremely low-fat, vegetarian diet with
exercise, meditation and smoking cessation.
</P>
<P>
   Within four months, Hebenstreit said, he felt a difference.
Fourteen years later, he has a very different life. Now 85, he
starts the morning with 25 push-ups, does yoga stretches and walks
a half hour a day. He takes no heart medication, unless you count a
baby aspirin every other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 71, I was convinced I would die very soon,'' said
Hebenstreit, who lives in San Francisco. ``I feel healthier now
than when I was 40 years younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a first-ever experiment on critically ill elderly
people, Medicare will examine whether what worked for Hebenstreit
will work on a large scale and bring down medical costs. Enrollment
of volunteers started on Monday. The nutrition and exercise
experiment is designed to determine whether drastic changes in
lifestyle and eating habits can prevent the need for angioplasty
and heart bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for us is how to modernize Medicare from a
medical, acute care model to a comprehensive, health care model
emphasizing successful and healthy aging through health promotion
and risk factor reduction,'' said Jeffrey Kang, chief clinical
officer with the Health Care Financing Administration, which
oversees Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the HCFA defended the choice of Ornish's program,
saying that studies had been sufficient to warrant a pilot project.
The program has been criticized by some health experts as too
restrictive, and, they say, the studies that point to the program's
success have been too small to draw such conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Hash, deputy administrator of the HCF A, said the
Ornish program was selected after Ornish made a proposal to the
agency, which wanted to see if the results could be replicated. The
agency is advertising for other similar programs to test.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three years, about 1,800 elderly heart patients,
at a cost of $7,200 each, will follow the program, run out of at
least 15 centers whose staffs are trained by Ornish, for one year.
While the demonstration project, financed by Medicare, tests a form
of treatment, it exemplifies a broad shift toward preventive
medicine being examined by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Medicare took major steps in this direction when
coverage was expanded to include colorectal cancer screening, bone
mass measurement for osteoporosis and expanded benefits for
screenings like mammograms and pelvic exams.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a panel of experts from the Institute of Medicine,
part of the National Academy of Sciences, recommended that Medicare
pay for outpatient nutrition counseling. According to the report,
86 percent of the estimated 34 million Americans over 65 have at
least one chronic condition like high blood pressure or diabetes
that might be helped by nutrition counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Many see the moves as long overdue. While Medicare has
traditionally covered nutrition therapy for hospitalized patients,
some health experts said that with the current emphasis on cost
cutting, such services were often lost and in any case had rarely
been offered to outpatients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospital stays are shorter and shorter so work that used to be
done in the hospital isn't being done very much,'' said Dr.
Virginia A. Stallings, chairwoman of the institute's panel of
experts and the chief of the nutrition section at Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she said, growing evidence indicates that
nutrition therapy can be a cost-effective way to deal with
outpatients with chronic disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science supports nutrition in the management of a number
of important diseases,'' Stallings said. ``There really is a place
for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, however, while praising the concept, questioned
whether large number numbers of people would be able to stick to
the highly regimented Ornish program. For instance, Ornish
recommends that fat intake be no more than 10 percent daily, while
the United States Department of Agriculture's guidelines recommend
no more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the American Heart Association said many of the
studies showing results with the Ornish program had been small and
that more information was needed on which parts of the program had
the most effect. They also said that such a restrictive program
might have negative effects on the day-to-day quality of life of
patients and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel the situation is at all clear as to whether this
approach is going to be applicable to the general population,''
said Dr. Ronald M. Krauss, past chairman of the nutrition committee
of the heart association. ``They should have looked into
potentially less expensive ways of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hash said: ``We wouldn't be proceeding to demonstrate this
with the Medicare population if we didn't have confidence that it
had produced evidence of effectiveness in reducing heart disease.
We have determined it is promising as a possible alternative to
bypass surgery.'' Coronary heart disease, he added, is the leading
cause of death among people receiving Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Medicare's test of the Ornish program is not a clinical trial,
but will instead follow the progress of volunteers who enroll at
the centers. Rather than testing the effectiveness of the program
as a health measure per se, the Medicare is intended to show
whether people who stick with it end up costing the program less.
It is the first time Medicare has run a payment demonstration on a
lifestyle-modification program.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna Dwyer, director of the nutrition clinic at New England
Medical Center Hospital, said that many elderly patients did not
get nutrition counseling and that such steps could help. She
recalled the case of an elderly woman with emphysema who was taking
a large amount of medicine that affected her appetite. Nutrition
counselors were able to find foods she could eat and get her back
on track. ``Nutrition isn't a cure all, but it's part of the
solution,'' Dwyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ornish said he began looking for a new approach to heart surgery
23 years ago when he was a medical student learning to do bypass
surgery. Patients would come in for surgery, go home to the same
food and stresses and soon be back for another bypass.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me that became a metaphor,'' Ornish said. ``Like mopping
up the floor without turning off the faucet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ornish diet is vegetarian relying on combinations of complex
carbohydrates to replace proteins found in meat, fish and poultry.
The only animal products allowed on the diet are egg whites and
nonfat dairy products. No oils can be added to food, but moderate
amounts of sugar, alcohol and salt (unless otherwise restricted for
health reasons) can be used. No caffeine is allowed. The bulk of
the diet is made up of a large variety of whole grains, vegetables,
fruits and legumes.
</P>
<P>
   Hebenstreit, while no longer part of an official Ornish program,
still maintains the strict regimen.
</P>
<P>
   The Hebenstreits start each day with whole grain cereal,
sweetened only with fruit juice. They each eat a whole orange as
opposed to drinking orange juice, which is more concentrated and
has a higher sugar content. Hebenstreit also has a piece of toast,
spread with ripe banana and orange marmalade. Rather than coffee,
the Hebenstreits have a substitute made from grain.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch is typically a sandwich on whole grain bread with soy
cheese, bean paste, tomato, onion and some type of green like
spinach or baby lettuce, followed by fruit. Or they make soup with
a variety of beans and grains. For dinner, they have pasta or
polenta with steamed vegetables and grapefruit or fat-free fig
bars.
</P>
<P>
   Don Vaupel, 61, a retired professor from Oakland, Calif., and an
Ornish patient of 11 years, said he decided to try the program as
an alternative to bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back to his early days on the diet, he said, ``all I can
remember is that lots of things were dark green and brown and not
very tasty.'' In the early days, he said lunch might have been a
sweet potato and salad with nothing on it. Dinner consisted of
steamed vegetables and steamed rice. Now, with all the new low-fat
foods, things have gotten more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   As he arrived home from the store recently, Vaupel was carrying
the ingredients for a frittata he would make with an egg substitute
for dinner: portobello mushrooms, fat-free parmesan and ricotta and
spinach.
</P>
<P>
   He generally starts his day with green tea and a soy-powder
protein shake, which he pours over a whole grain cereal like
grapenuts. For lunch he might have a grilled low-fat cheese
sandwich on whole wheat bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just walked three miles,'' he said. ``I don't mean walk
like, oh look at the pretty flower. I walk, break a sweat and then
slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   He meditates for an hour each morning and night although he
prefers to call it ``my appointment with me.'' He lost 110 pounds
in the first nine months of the program, 85 of which have stayed
off permanently and there has been reversal in the blockages of his
heart, his doctors tell him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all his accomplishments, he said he still needed
nutritional counseling. Three years ago he received a diagnosis of
adult diabetes, which he also works to control through diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go on a diet,'' Vaupel said. ``This was a lifestyle
change. I had to change everything.''

WHY DO THEY HATE HILLARY SO MUCH?

writer at U.S. News &AMP; World Report)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY JODIE T. ALLEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- I spent a couple of hours the other day at a
remarkable gathering. It was a symposium held at the prestigious
American Enterprise Institute. The meeting was held in cooperation
with the Center for the Study of Popular Culture, a West Coast
operation whose admiration for our current first family is, how
shall we say, restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Only one topic was on the daylong agenda: The Legacy and Future
of Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, as we journalists are rigorously trained to do, I
approached the subject with dispassion and scientific curiosity.
Judging from the outpouring of high-pitched, even hate-filled books
on the subject of Mrs. Clinton, the hideous possibility of her
election to be the junior senator from the Empire State is looming
large in many prolific minds.
</P>
<P>
   And, judging by the recent polls, these authors and their
readers have good reason to be worried. Despite all their timely
warnings, it seems that at least a slim majority of New Yorkers,
even many in conservative upstate, are warming to the carpetbagger
-- or at least cooling on her opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But what, exactly are the Hillary Haters so worried about? Why,
I asked the audience, would a roomful of busy scholars and
dignitaries devote an entire day to exploring the threat posed by
one candidate among many seeking election to the federal
legislature? What sort of senator would Hillary Clinton be that she
evokes such visceral response?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know Mrs. Clinton personally and have met her on only a
few occasions. But like many others, I have read a great deal about
her. I also know a few people who have worked for or with her over
the years. So I feel pretty confident in offering the following
picture of Hillary Clinton, U.S. Senator:
</P>
<P>
   She will, first and foremost, be disciplined and diligent, well
informed and well prepared. She asks smart questions of her staff
and the people who consult with her. Even before her recent
``listening tour'' of New York State, she knew how to listen.
</P>
<P>
   But she also knows how to talk. Anyone who has ever heard her
will have to agree that she is a most accomplished public speaker
with a sometimes uncanny poise. Right after the Monica Lewinsky
scandal hit the headlines in January 1998, when most of us in her
shoes would have been hiding under a bed, I saw her address a
packed auditorium of world movers and shakers gathered at the World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. She spoke for about 40
minutes without notes and without pause -- not a single ``er'' or
``I mean'' or ``that is'' -- and she wowed 'em. Even the snotty
Brits from the Economist were impressed.
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Clinton -- remarkably in this town of flacks and
flunkies--does a lot of her own research, so she usually knows what
she's talking about -- even if you don't agree with her. Her staff
chuckles about her famous cardboard box into which she dumps
articles, briefing papers, and research summaries that catch her
interest and which she drags out at meetings for follow-up. If it's
dairy farms she needs to talk about, she'll know the price of every
cow and the cost and distribution of every milk subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator, she will be religious in impulse. Her
religiousness has been firm since her youth, and contrary to the
'60s stereotype, she was no hippie -- she never dabbled in drugs or
took to the streets to bring down the system. She even started off
in life as a Republican. (This reminder actually evoked a gasp from
some more zealous among my listeners.)
</P>
<P>
   She will be most concerned about ``kitchen table'' issues --
especially children both at home and around the world. Mrs. Clinton
is, of course, a mother herself and, judging by the proof of the
pudding, a pretty good one. Her own daughter, after all, is, by all
accounts and appearances, an exceedingly attractive, poised,
sensible, and hard-working student.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Mrs. Clinton was an early proponent of the notion that
a child may, under certain extreme circumstances, have rights and
interests that trump those of his parents. This idea was once
dubbed radical. But as Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen has
pointed out, it seems to have acquired a far broader--and more
conservative -- constituency in the current arguments over the fate
of one Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   She will be a persuasive politician. All her experience on the
campaign trail -- not just for herself but earlier for other
candidates -- seems to demonstrate that the more people see her the
more they like her. Sorry!
</P>
<P>
   Next, she will be willing to compromise -- this may come as a
surprise. But Mrs. Clinton has been trained in compromise ever
since she first arrived in Arkansas and discovered that her
plain-Jane, eyeglassed image didn't play well with the Razorbacks.
So she got blonded and contact-lensed, and now, if there is any
concern about her appearance among her detractors, it's that she's
too photogenic -- at least for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, her health-care plan was over-engineered and overbearing.
But since then, she's learned to be a good tactician. She works
through intermediaries -- on Capitol Hill, in the nonprofit and
corporate sectors, and in her many quiet policy pushes since the
health-care debacle. She knows when to keep her head down and live
to fight another day. And here her acquiescence in and subsequent
support for welfare reform is a good case in point.
</P>
<P>
   And she will draw attention -- not just to herself but to the
important business of policymaking. She will be devoted to her job
and to the idea of public service.
</P>
<P>
   My goodness. Who could possibly want an elected representative
like that?
</P>
<P>
   How in the world could such a woman possibly fit into the club
of Solons, the corps of modest, self-effacing, even-tempered,
erudite, and devoted persons whom we know to be the U.S. Senate?
Surely this will be the end of American democracy as it has evolved
in our times.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, are the real perils that so many fear? Let's put
some flesh on this monster, on this face that launched a dozen
screeds.
</P>
<P>
   Is it conceivable, for example, that Clinton will draw so much
attention to the Senate that some of her colleagues might be
revealed in a less than flattering light? Surely her senatorial
colleagues are not so bashful or so fearful of the limelight. Isn't
it more likely that they will bask in her reflected brilliance?
</P>
<P>
   Well, then might not her famous temper get out of control? Might
she throw a tantrum in the Senate aisles? We've all heard stories
about her temper -- mostly as it has been directed (justly no
doubt) at her errant husband. But it's worth noting that all the
many people who have worked for her over the years attest that she
is a good boss. Demanding, yes, sometimes preoccupied (who could
blame her?), but generous in her praise, concerned about her
colleagues and subordinates and unerringly polite and gracious in
public. She runs a collegial -- not a command-and-control --
operation and her staff are devoted to her.
</P>
<P>
   Think, by way of contrast, of some of her potential colleagues
in the Senate, many of whom are positively famous for blowing their
stacks, abusing their staff, and even occasionally ranting and
raving. At her rumored worst, it's hard to imagine that Hillary
would stand out in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Third fear: She's no Eleanor Roosevelt, as Christopher Hitchens
complained in his boffo kick-off of the recent meeting. So? Is Al
Gore Abraham Lincoln? Is John McCain Mahatma Gandhi? Is George W.
Bush George Washington? Please.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the worry expressed by author and Reagan devotee
Peggy Noonan -- that electing Mrs. Clinton to the Senate will
spread the disease of Clintonism. But what are the symptoms of this
dread malady on the body politic? Low unemployment? High growth?
Low inflation? Soaring productivity? Maybe it's that dash of
irrational exuberance that so alarms the Noonanites.
</P>
<P>
   Next threat: She will generate controversy. Heaven forfend! This
eventuality is, of course, of special concern to us journalists who
-- as you know -- deplore the occasional descent of the sober
business of governance into the low clash of personality and the
trading of bootless recriminations. (Are there any other kind?)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, of course, there is the bedrock concern: She's too
liberal. (Part of a group of ``messianic socialists,'' charged the
day's final speaker, David Horowitz, I am told.) But too liberal
compared with whom? Charles Schumer? Paul Wellstone? Ted Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   And while we're on the subject of Ted Kennedy. Surely no person
in the Senate has ever possessed a higher profile or set of
aspirations -- at least on the part of his adherents. Here he was
the survivor of two martyred brothers, the keeper of the liberal
flame. His colleagues must have been terrified of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite his scarcely deniable personal failings, Kennedy has
built a reputation as an effective and collegial legislator who is
skilled at compromise. And despite the threat of this star-quality
liberal menace on Capitol Hill, Republicans have held the White
House for 20 of the last 32 years. The country has edged rightward
-- and settled pretty much comfortably about where the mainstream
GOP used to be. The republic is intact, Columbia, not Britannia,
rules the waves, God's in his heaven and all's right with the
markets.
</P>
<P>
   What are the Hillary-bashers so scared of? I didn't really get
any answer from either the audience (which, by and large, took my
remarks in good spirit if not great good humor) or from my fellow
panelists.
</P>
<P>
   There were, to be sure, repeated recitations of the Clintons'
alleged transgressions from Whitewater to Monica. Also some
complaints that Mrs. Clinton wants to have it both ways -- victim
of her husband but policy player in her own right.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't recall that Mrs. Clinton ever portrayed herself as a
victim. It was a sympathetic public that, seeing her carry herself
with uncommon dignity through her ordeal, so classified her. I'm
still puzzled.

   &UR; BY JODIE T. ALLEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- I spent a couple of hours the other day at a
remarkable gathering. It was a symposium held at the prestigious
American Enterprise Institute. The meeting was held in cooperation
with the Center for the Study of Popular Culture, a West Coast
operation whose admiration for our current first family is, how
shall we say, restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Only one topic was on the daylong agenda: The Legacy and Future
of Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, as we journalists are rigorously trained to do, I
approached the subject with dispassion and scientific curiosity.
Judging from the outpouring of high-pitched, even hate-filled books
on the subject of Mrs. Clinton, the hideous possibility of her
election to be the junior senator from the Empire State is looming
large in many prolific minds.
</P>
<P>
   And, judging by the recent polls, these authors and their
readers have good reason to be worried. Despite all their timely
warnings, it seems that at least a slim majority of New Yorkers,
even many in conservative upstate, are warming to the carpetbagger
-- or at least cooling on her opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But what, exactly are the Hillary Haters so worried about? Why,
I asked the audience, would a roomful of busy scholars and
dignitaries devote an entire day to exploring the threat posed by
one candidate among many seeking election to the federal
legislature? What sort of senator would Hillary Clinton be that she
evokes such visceral response?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know Mrs. Clinton personally and have met her on only a
few occasions. But like many others, I have read a great deal about
her. I also know a few people who have worked for or with her over
the years. So I feel pretty confident in offering the following
picture of Hillary Clinton, U.S. Senator:
</P>
<P>
   She will, first and foremost, be disciplined and diligent, well
informed and well prepared. She asks smart questions of her staff
and the people who consult with her. Even before her recent
``listening tour'' of New York State, she knew how to listen.
</P>
<P>
   But she also knows how to talk. Anyone who has ever heard her
will have to agree that she is a most accomplished public speaker
with a sometimes uncanny poise. Right after the Monica Lewinsky
scandal hit the headlines in January 1998, when most of us in her
shoes would have been hiding under a bed, I saw her address a
packed auditorium of world movers and shakers gathered at the World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. She spoke for about 40
minutes without notes and without pause -- not a single ``er'' or
``I mean'' or ``that is'' -- and she wowed 'em. Even the snotty
Brits from the Economist were impressed.
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Clinton -- remarkably in this town of flacks and
flunkies--does a lot of her own research, so she usually knows what
she's talking about -- even if you don't agree with her. Her staff
chuckles about her famous cardboard box into which she dumps
articles, briefing papers, and research summaries that catch her
interest and which she drags out at meetings for follow-up. If it's
dairy farms she needs to talk about, she'll know the price of every
cow and the cost and distribution of every milk subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator, she will be religious in impulse. Her
religiousness has been firm since her youth, and contrary to the
'60s stereotype, she was no hippie -- she never dabbled in drugs or
took to the streets to bring down the system. She even started off
in life as a Republican. (This reminder actually evoked a gasp from
some more zealous among my listeners.)
</P>
<P>
   She will be most concerned about ``kitchen table'' issues --
especially children both at home and around the world. Mrs. Clinton
is, of course, a mother herself and, judging by the proof of the
pudding, a pretty good one. Her own daughter, after all, is, by all
accounts and appearances, an exceedingly attractive, poised,
sensible, and hard-working student.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Mrs. Clinton was an early proponent of the notion that
a child may, under certain extreme circumstances, have rights and
interests that trump those of his parents. This idea was once
dubbed radical. But as Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen has
pointed out, it seems to have acquired a far broader--and more
conservative -- constituency in the current arguments over the fate
of one Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   She will be a persuasive politician. All her experience on the
campaign trail -- not just for herself but earlier for other
candidates -- seems to demonstrate that the more people see her the
more they like her. Sorry!
</P>
<P>
   Next, she will be willing to compromise -- this may come as a
surprise. But Mrs. Clinton has been trained in compromise ever
since she first arrived in Arkansas and discovered that her
plain-Jane, eyeglassed image didn't play well with the Razorbacks.
So she got blonded and contact-lensed, and now, if there is any
concern about her appearance among her detractors, it's that she's
too photogenic -- at least for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, her health-care plan was over-engineered and overbearing.
But since then, she's learned to be a good tactician. She works
through intermediaries -- on Capitol Hill, in the nonprofit and
corporate sectors, and in her many quiet policy pushes since the
health-care debacle. She knows when to keep her head down and live
to fight another day. And here her acquiescence in and subsequent
support for welfare reform is a good case in point.
</P>
<P>
   And she will draw attention -- not just to herself but to the
important business of policymaking. She will be devoted to her job
and to the idea of public service.
</P>
<P>
   My goodness. Who could possibly want an elected representative
like that?
</P>
<P>
   How in the world could such a woman possibly fit into the club
of Solons, the corps of modest, self-effacing, even-tempered,
erudite, and devoted persons whom we know to be the U.S. Senate?
Surely this will be the end of American democracy as it has evolved
in our times.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, are the real perils that so many fear? Let's put
some flesh on this monster, on this face that launched a dozen
screeds.
</P>
<P>
   Is it conceivable, for example, that Clinton will draw so much
attention to the Senate that some of her colleagues might be
revealed in a less than flattering light? Surely her senatorial
colleagues are not so bashful or so fearful of the limelight. Isn't
it more likely that they will bask in her reflected brilliance?
</P>
<P>
   Well, then might not her famous temper get out of control? Might
she throw a tantrum in the Senate aisles? We've all heard stories
about her temper -- mostly as it has been directed (justly no
doubt) at her errant husband. But it's worth noting that all the
many people who have worked for her over the years attest that she
is a good boss. Demanding, yes, sometimes preoccupied (who could
blame her?), but generous in her praise, concerned about her
colleagues and subordinates and unerringly polite and gracious in
public. She runs a collegial -- not a command-and-control --
operation and her staff are devoted to her.
</P>
<P>
   Think, by way of contrast, of some of her potential colleagues
in the Senate, many of whom are positively famous for blowing their
stacks, abusing their staff, and even occasionally ranting and
raving. At her rumored worst, it's hard to imagine that Hillary
would stand out in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Third fear: She's no Eleanor Roosevelt, as Christopher Hitchens
complained in his boffo kick-off of the recent meeting. So? Is Al
Gore Abraham Lincoln? Is John McCain Mahatma Gandhi? Is George W.
Bush George Washington? Please.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the worry expressed by author and Reagan devotee
Peggy Noonan -- that electing Mrs. Clinton to the Senate will
spread the disease of Clintonism. But what are the symptoms of this
dread malady on the body politic? Low unemployment? High growth?
Low inflation? Soaring productivity? Maybe it's that dash of
irrational exuberance that so alarms the Noonanites.
</P>
<P>
   Next threat: She will generate controversy. Heaven forfend! This
eventuality is, of course, of special concern to us journalists who
-- as you know -- deplore the occasional descent of the sober
business of governance into the low clash of personality and the
trading of bootless recriminations. (Are there any other kind?)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, of course, there is the bedrock concern: She's too
liberal. (Part of a group of ``messianic socialists,'' charged the
day's final speaker, David Horowitz, I am told.) But too liberal
compared with whom? Charles Schumer? Paul Wellstone? Ted Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   And while we're on the subject of Ted Kennedy. Surely no person
in the Senate has ever possessed a higher profile or set of
aspirations -- at least on the part of his adherents. Here he was
the survivor of two martyred brothers, the keeper of the liberal
flame. His colleagues must have been terrified of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite his scarcely deniable personal failings, Kennedy has
built a reputation as an effective and collegial legislator who is
skilled at compromise. And despite the threat of this star-quality
liberal menace on Capitol Hill, Republicans have held the White
House for 20 of the last 32 years. The country has edged rightward
-- and settled pretty much comfortably about where the mainstream
GOP used to be. The republic is intact, Columbia, not Britannia,
rules the waves, God's in his heaven and all's right with the
markets.
</P>
<P>
   What are the Hillary-bashers so scared of? I didn't really get
any answer from either the audience (which, by and large, took my
remarks in good spirit if not great good humor) or from my fellow
panelists.
</P>
<P>
   There were, to be sure, repeated recitations of the Clintons'
alleged transgressions from Whitewater to Monica. Also some
complaints that Mrs. Clinton wants to have it both ways -- victim
of her husband but policy player in her own right.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't recall that Mrs. Clinton ever portrayed herself as a
victim. It was a sympathetic public that, seeing her carry herself
with uncommon dignity through her ordeal, so classified her. I'm
still puzzled.

   (Judith Shulevitz writes Slate's ``Culturebox'' column)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY JUDITH SHULEVITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Could an Orthodox Jew serve as president of the United States?
The question isn't strictly Talmudic anymore, since the name of an
Orthodox Jew has cropped up on Democratic vice-presidential
candidate short-lists.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman -- who is clearly a long shot -- is a
Democrat from Connecticut whose presumed appeal for Al Gore lies in
his right-of-center politics, his religious commitment (which makes
him attractive to social conservatives), and his early condemnation
of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky (which would help
Gore distance himself from the president's perceived moral
turpitude).
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman is also what Jews call ``Shomer Shabbas'' -- he
observes the rules that say what a Jew can and can't do between
sunset Friday night and sunset Saturday night. Among the many
things he can't do: drive or be driven, turn lights on or off, talk
on the telephone, operate anything powered by electricity, or
write.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Weekly Standard, Lieberman's embrace of these
religious restrictions would probably disqualify him from the
vice-presidency. At the very least, writes reporter Matthew Rees,
they ``would provoke questions about his ability to govern in the
event he became president.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there are questions, there must be answers. We called a
rabbi, professors of Talmud at two leading Jewish universities, and
Lieberman himself to find out what those questions and answers
would be.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start at the beginning. Why are so many things forbidden
on the Jewish Sabbath? The Sabbath is much more important in
Judaism than is generally understood. You'd think the Sabbath would
be a routine event, coming as it does every seventh day, but the
Jews consider the Sabbath to be more sacred than any holiday except
Yom Kippur, the annual Day of Atonement.
</P>
<P>
   Also, contrary to popular belief, the Sabbath isn't entirely a
day of rest. All productivity must cease and all worldly pursuits
must be set aside, but less for one's personal restoration than for
the active contemplation of the wonders of God's creation -- the
chief wonders being, in Judaism, the family, the community, and
Torah, or the Pentateuch and its commentaries.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that the Sabbath finds Jews in the proper frame of
mind, they are enjoined from doing or handling anything that might
distract them from the higher purpose of honoring God and all he
has made.
</P>
<P>
   Given these restrictions, how has Lieberman been able to
function as a senator? In his 11 years in the U.S. Senate,
Lieberman said, he has always voted when required to do so on
Friday night or Saturday, and has also attended all emergency White
House meetings held on the Sabbath. To do this, he walks to the
Capitol or White House (which is to say, he does not accept a ride,
which would be forbidden). Luckily for him, senators vote by voice,
not by pushing a button (so that he doesn't have to operate
machinery).
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many technical rules he obeys, he would appear to
be violating the spirit of the Sabbath, according to which one must
refrain from work. How does he get away with it? There are two
answers to this:
</P>
<P>
   -- In Judaism, as opposed to, say, Catholicism, there is no
clear authority or doctrine. Jews are left to draw their own
conclusions based on their readings of Jewish law, with help from
their local rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   -- In consultation with his rabbis, Lieberman has concluded that
while it would be counter to the spirit of the Sabbath to engage in
what he calls ``politics'' -- i.e., photo ops or any other kind of
campaigning -- it is in keeping with the Sabbath to fulfill what he
calls his ``governmental or public responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He explains: ``You come to a point where you have to decide
whether your rigid observance of the ritual puts you in a position
of failing to uphold an ethical value that is also central to your
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he isn't observing the Sabbath as strictly as he could
be, should Lieberman still be considered an Orthodox Jew? According
to two professors of Talmud at Yeshiva University, an Orthodox
college, Lieberman's choice to perform his duties as a government
official on the Sabbath when he's required to do so can be
reconciled with the strictest construction of Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is granted an exemption from the Sabbath's enforced
idleness on the basis of two concepts: pikuach nefesh, roughly
translated from Hebrew as ``regard for human life,'' and tzorchei
tzibbur, or ``the needs of the community.'' Under pikuach nefesh, a
Jew may profane the Sabbath if human life is at stake, as it may
sometimes be in Senate legislation. Tzorchei tzibbur says that Jews
are allowed to make decisions that affect the entire community on
the Sabbath -- they just can't make ones that affect them or their
family alone.
</P>
<P>
   Everything Lieberman allows himself to do, these rabbis say, is
covered by one of those two concepts. (It should be noted that
pikuach nefesh has traditionally been understood as pertaining only
to Jewish life, but rabbinical rulings in the second half of this
century have extended it to non-Jews, mainly on the grounds that to
save only the lives of Jews under pikuach nefesh would get the
goyim so upset that Jewish lives would be put at risk.)
</P>
<P>
   So, is there anything he couldn't do as vice-president, or as a
vice-presidential candidate? Asked about his vice-presidential
prospects, Lieberman was careful to issue ``the standard
disqualification, which is sincerely expressed,'' that he didn't
expect to be named vice-president, nor was he seeking the position.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, he wanted to clear up any misunderstanding
about what a religiously observant person could or could not do in
an executive office. Lieberman says that, as a hypothetical
vice-president, he would balance his duties with the demands of the
Sabbath much as he has balanced them as senator: ``I feel I've
reached a conclusion on these questions that I'm comfortable
with.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not campaign or perform any other strictly political
duties. He would, however, vote in the Senate if he was needed to
break a tie and he would meet with world leaders or members of the
Cabinet -- ``I'd try to schedule them some other time, but if
something needed to be done, I'd do it.'' What if he had to travel
to meet them? ``I'd try to avoid it, but if I had to ride, I'd
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the case of an emergency? Lieberman refused to speculate
about anything as dire as a president's incapacitation: ``I'm so
far down the chain of hypotheticals, I'm going to let you draw your
own conclusion.'' But presumably he would be allowed to do just
about anything he had to under the rule of pikuach nefesh --
including being sworn in as president should anything happen to the
president, and pushing the button to launch a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   What if something came up on the Sabbath which wasn't a
life-or-death emergency, but which he really ought to take care of
-- then and there? Yeshiva professor of Talmud J. David Bleich says
Lieberman would be allowed to delegate just about any urgent but
non-life-saving task to a non-Jew, as long as it was also on behalf
of non-Jews.
</P>
<P>
   A Jew is forbidden to ask a non-Jew to do something for him on
the Sabbath that he wouldn't do for himself (in other words, a Jew
is not allowed to have a Shabbas goy, even though many do) but ``to
personally give directions to non-Jews for the benefit of non-Jews
is permissible,'' says Bleich. This rule would cover anything that
could be construed as for the good of American citizens, since the
majority of them are not Jewish.

Cox staff and wire reports.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain predicted Monday that if Hillary Rodham Clinton is
elected, she will be a ``star'' unlike any politician seen in the
Senate since Robert F. Kennedy. But he says she's still too liberal
for his taste. McCain made the comments in a day campaigning for
Clinton's opponent in New York, Rudy Giuliani. ``This is the first
time in history a first lady has run,'' McCain told students at
Columbia University. ``She would be a star of the quality that has
not been seen in the Senate since Bobby Kennedy. ... Many of us
believe in a scenario if Gore lost and she is elected to the
Senate, she'd be running for president.'' Asked by reporters to
clarify his remarks about Clinton, McCain said, ``I believe she'd
be very liberal, and I don't believe she'd be good for the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   PROUD OF THE COMPANY
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani, joined for the second time in a week by John
McCain, ridiculed a suggestion that he and the senator are linked
to the far right wing. ``I want to show everybody that I want to
associate with the senator,'' Giuliani said at a midtown Manhattan
deli with McCain. Giuliani's comments were a reaction to a remark
last week by Hillary Rodham Clinton's media consultant, Ellis
Verdi: ``I am surprised that Mayor Giuliani would associate himself
with someone who is that far to the right,'' Verdi was quoted in
the New York Post as saying. Giuliani: ``I noticed that, since my
last visit here, I am now part of the `vast right-wing conspiracy.'
``I am very proud to be part of that organization.''
</P>
<P>
   BUT JOHN, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO LOST
</P>
<P>
   John McCain may soon relent to do some campaigning for that
other Republican who wants a win in New York. CNN.com reports that
McCain is warming, slightly, to the idea of supporting George W.
Bush. ``My strategy is to make sure that Governor Bush is the
president of the United States.'' McCain said in a CNN television
interview in New York. ``I just need to reach some understandings
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW WOULD MARCIA CLARK HAVE DONE?
</P>
<P>
   The police corruption scandal has damaged Los Angeles County
District Attorney Gil Garcetti's campaign for a third term, placing
him far behind challenger Steve Cooley in a poll published Monday.
Garcetti trailed Cooley, one of his own top deputies, 55 percent to
18 percent in the Los Angeles Times poll. Twenty-six percent of
those polled said they had not made up their minds, but Garcetti
would still trail by 11 percentage points even if he won all those
votes, according to the poll, which had a 3 percentage point margin
of error. The scandal involves officers who allegedly framed, beat
and sometimes shot innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   AND FLORIDA'S A KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE
</P>
<P>
   The vice presidency has been famously likened to ``bucket of
warm spit,'' but it seems Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) wouldn't mind
carrying that bucket. In a meeting with Roll Call reporters and
editors, Graham indicated he'd take the job _ if Al Gore asks him
to be his running mate, that is. Said Graham: ``If the presidential
nominee of your party asks you to serve in that position, it is
almost impossible to say no.''
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE TOO MUCH OF AN OUTSIDER
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Congress has fallen out of love with George W.
Bush, according to the New York Times. After pre-primary pledges of
support, congressional Republican leaders are starting to plan
around either a Bush loss or a coattail-free win. In addition to
Bush's dwindling poll numbers, the Times says, many Republicans say
the Bush-Congress relationship is doomed by lack of communication,
making a unified agenda nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   HEAVY DOSE OF ISOLATIONISM
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan and his Minnesota supporters turned out in force in
Bloomington to re-establish the state's branch of the Reform Party.
And this time it's stacked with Buchanan supporters. After
commenting on Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura's comments about the
party being ``dysfunctional,'' Buchanan went on to criticize
Ventura, Al Gore and George W. Bush for supporting an end to trade
restrictions with China. But Buchanan's loudest applause came when
he attacked the International Monetary Fund, world trade groups and
other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   HE'S WAITING FOR THE MOVIE TO COME OUT
</P>
<P>
   As the 2000 presidential campaign took a welcome literary turn,
George W. Bush attacked Al Gore's book on the environment, ``Earth
in the Balance.'' ``I think the vice president is probably going to
have to explain what he meant by some of the things in the book,''
Bush warned, ``to share with us the philosophy behind some of the
standards in the book.'' But in response to a question, according
to The Associated Press, Bush said that uh, no, he hadn't read the
book. Some explaining from Bush may be in order, too.
</P>
<P>
   SOFT ON MICROSOFT?
</P>
<P>
   The state and federal governments have won the first round of
their antitrust case against Microsoft, but with years of legal
appeals anticipated, the new president could change how the case is
resolved. George W. Bush has signaled he would be more friendly to
the company; Al Gore generally has stayed silent. There is
precedent for a new administration changing course in a major
antitrust case: In 1982, Ronald Reagan's Justice Department threw
out a case against IBM that had lingered since 1969. But, since
there are 19 states also listed as plaintiffs in the Microsoft
case, legal scholars say the next president wouldn't affect the
case as much.
</P>
<P>
   VOTING WITH THEIR FEET
</P>
<P>
   Runners in Sunday's Cherry Blossom 10-mile race had to choose
among three chutes to pass through near the race's end: Democrat,
Republican, Other. The highly anticipated results: Democrats ran
away with the victory. With a quarter-mile to go, runners could
veer left through the Democratic gate, steer right through the
Republican gate or head straight through ``other.'' Electronic
chips in the runners' shoes recorded the results, with participants
promised anonymity as to how they voted. Some 2,269 runners picked
Democrat (44 percent); 1,432 picked Republican (28 percent), edging
out ``other'' by only six runners. But what was the margin of
error?
</P>
<P>
   LIKE MUSIC FOR POLITICAL JUNKIES
</P>
<P>
   Three of Steve Forbes' former campaign staffers are launching
``what they say is the first national all-politics radio station on
the Internet,'' Reuters reported. Based in Davenport, Iowa,
Policast.com is to serve as an around-the-clock, seven-day-a-week
operation, with political news, commentary and humor. Said former
Forbes senior adviser Steve Grubbs: ``We aren't going to do
hurricanes or earthquakes; just politics _ national, state and
municipal. The demand for political news has exploded, and we
intend to deliver.'' Joining him are K.B. Forbes and Amanda Vogel.

WHAT CHILDREN DO WHEN HOME AND ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By LESLIE BERGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twelve to 14 percent of American children ages 5 to 12 spend
some time home alone after school, a new study has found, but the
period without adult supervision averages only an hour, most of the
children are older, and many seem to welcome a measure of privacy
and independence.
</P>
<P>
   Only 1 percent of the youngest children in a national sampling,
ages 5 to 7, were left in so-called self-care, while 8 percent of
the children 8 to 10 years old were in self-care, according to the
study by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social
Research. The biggest share of the children spending time alone was
older, about 23 percent of the 11- and 12-year-olds in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Eating, going to the bathroom and watching television are the
first three things children do when they get home, the study found.
And a little time alone may not be such a bad thing given working
families' hectic schedules and children's super-structured lives,
suggested Dr. Sandra Hofferth, the study's lead researcher. Often,
she said, older children used their time alone to read, study and
simply decompress.
</P>
<P>
   ``As children grow older, they want increased autonomy,''
Hofferth, a sociologist, said in an interview. ``What may be right
for younger elementary school children may not be right for older
ones. Around 9 or 10, kids want to care for themselves and don't
want to be in programs for babies anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, presented last week at a meeting of the Society for
Research on Adolescence in Chicago, was based on diaries of the
activities of about 1,500 children ages 5 to 12. The diaries were
kept in 1997; parents were interviewed for a clearer picture.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have been tracking latchkey children since the
1980s. The most significant shift in patterns came between 1984 and
1990, when the estimated number of children 5 to 12 in self-care
nearly doubled from 1.8 million to 3.4 million, Hofferth said.
Today, she said, 75 percent of women with school-age children work
outside the home at least part-time.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study, Hofferth said, shows that the number of
children in self-care has remained fairly steady over the last
decade, perhaps because many parents have begun sharing home duties
in split shifts, either by working part time or staggering their
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The findings also document in new detail how children's
activities vary from home, recreation centers and after-school
programs. Children in structured after-school programs were more
likely to participate in sports while children at home were more
likely to study or read.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Deborah Lowe Vandell, a professor of educational psychology
at the University of Wisconsin, who has written extensively on day
care and after-school programs, said the findings were consistent
with her own recent research in which children said they wanted
autonomy and privacy and the ability to set their own schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be foolish to say all self-care is bad, that
children shouldn't have any time alone, especially as they get
older,'' Vandell said. But she warned that sometimes too much
unsupervised time could be worse than over-programming.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, most children's after-school time, or 100 minutes
a day, was spent watching television. The diaries also showed that
an average of 74 minutes was spent playing, 60 minutes studying, 60
minutes in sports, 30 minutes on household chores, 30 minutes
reading, and 20 minutes in conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Most children, about 73 percent, go straight home after school,
whether or not they are alone, the study found. The first things
they reported doing upon their arrival were eating (27 percent);
engaging in personal care (19 percent), which could mean ``washing,
bathing and none of your business''; and watching television (15
percent). Only 13 percent of the children sampled made studying
their top priority.
</P>
<P>
   The child's personality, as well as the family income level and
neighborhood safety, were other factors in shaping after-school
routines. Quieter children were more likely to be left alone than
aggressive ones, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, researchers also found that children of older and
better-educated mothers were more likely to be unsupervised at home
than children of mothers with a high school education or less.
</P>
<P>
   But Hofferth said the ability to stay in touch by phone made a
huge difference in parents' willingness to leave children
temporarily alone, and that many parents with blue-collar jobs had
limited access to phones. In addition, more educated mothers seemed
more comfortable allowing their children some autonomy at younger
ages, Hofferth said.
</P>
<P>
   Children living in socially cohesive neighborhoods, where
parents rely on one another for emergencies, also were more likely
to take care of themselves after school. At the same time, however,
children in higher income families were more likely to be enrolled
in sports and other afternoon activities.

GIGANTIC ICEBERGS BREAK FREE FROM THE ANTARCTIC ICE CAP 
</HEADLINE>
 (The Science Times) By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two mammoth icebergs have broken off the Antarctic ice cap in
the last several weeks, including one that is the largest in more
than four decades.
</P>
<P>
   The larger berg, which is about 185 miles long by 23 miles wide,
or slightly smaller in area than Connecticut, was first noticed in
satellite photographs on March 17 by meteorologists at McMurdo
Station, the main American base in Antarctica. The iceberg broke
off the Ross Ice Shelf, a vast floating carpet of ice on the
continent's west side.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, Matthew Lazzara, a meteorologist with the
Antarctic Meteorological Research Center at the University of
Wisconsin in Madison, noticed that another giant berg had calved
off just to the east of the one found earlier. The second iceberg,
which was about one-third the size of the first, later broke into
four pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Lazzara said that as the larger iceberg broke off, it apparently
hit the ice sheet, causing the second berg to form. ``It's
basically like having a couple of parallel-parked cars, and one
jostles the other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The larger iceberg, which has been named B-15 following the
nomenclature of Antarctic ice research, is exceeded in the record
books only by one that formed in 1956. Lazzara said that ice in
this part of Antarctica, which moves toward the sea at a rate of
about a half a mile per year, is expected to break off bergs of
this size every 50 to 100 years, so the new iceberg fits nicely
into the time frame. It will probably break into several smaller
pieces as it moves out into the Ross Sea, Lazzara said.
</P>
<P>
   B-15 is about a quarter-mile thick, with almost all of that
below the water line. Lazzara said that he and his colleagues had
done some rough calculations and estimated that the iceberg
contained some 3.4 trillion gallons of water. That is about the
same volume as Lake Michigan.

SURREALIST'S BRUSH CAPTURES THE CORE OF INTRICATE IDEAS

 By NATALIE ANGIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Remedios Varo, considered one of the greatest
surrealist painters of the 20th century, is so obscure to most
Americans that when Dr. Alan J. Friedman, a physicist and director
of the New York Hall of Science, first came across mention of her
in a Thomas Pynchon novel years ago, a colleague assured him that
Pynchon had made her up.
</P>
<P>
   But as Friedman eventually discovered, Varo's work is no
pigment, if you will, of anybody's imagination. Her extravagantly
meticulous and multivalent paintings have long been celebrated in
Mexico, her adopted home, side-by-side with the work of her more
name-brand compatriot and friend, Frida Kahlo.
</P>
<P>
   And now, 37 years after her death, Varo is at last beginning to
receive international acclaim, including the admiration of a cadre
not always known for its arthouse savvy: the scientific community.
</P>
<P>
   In a symposium here this month at the National Museum for Women
in the Arts, where Varo's first major retrospective in the United
States is on view through May 29, Friedman discussed the appeal
Varo holds for scientists and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   He described how the artist metaphorically conveyed in her
paintings some of the most revolutionary and complex scientific
theories of the age, from Einstein's special theory of relativity
and Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection to the
premise that humans are the stuff of stars, their bodies built of
elements baked in solar bellies millions or billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many paintings have the square root of minus one in
them?'' he asked rhetorically in an interview. ``Clearly she's
fascinated by science. Her paintings include lots of machinery,
gears and pulleys and cranks, test tubes and orreries,'' mechanical
models of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first textbooks about general relativity, he said,
``The Riddle of Gravitation,'' by Peter Bergmann (Charles
Scribner's Sons, 1968), displayed one of Varo's paintings, ``The
Phenomenon of Weightlessness,'' on its cover.
</P>
<P>
   As Friedman sees it, Varo sought in particular to convey the
most profound and creative moments in a scientist's life, when the
researcher first dares to imagine an alternate universe, a model of
how things work that differs radically from the models preceding
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she's doing, uniquely among artists, is presenting this
core moment of discovery that's so exciting in science,'' he said.
``She realized that this central act of the imagination in science,
this free play of the mind, is very similar to what artists do.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, in ``Phenomenon of Weightlessness,'' a man,
presumably a scientist, stands in a room with a number of orreries
on shelves. One orrery, of the Earth and Moon, has broken free of
its base and floats in the air. In addition, the room is duplicated
and shown superimposed over the original, but at an angle of 30
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   This room is the special theory of relativity made real, or
surreal. To depict the so-called Lorenz equations, which are at the
heart of Einstein's revelation, Friedman said, one would draw a
standard graph with X and Y axes, and then rotate the graph 30
degrees to show how time and space shift for different states of
motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often the scientist is described as looking frightened,
because the world is shifting under his feet,'' Friedman said.
``But in fact he's absolutely engrossed with every fiber of his
being. This isn't something that happened to him; he invented it.
He sees that there is another way of treating gravitation and
reference frames, and he's astonished that he's come up with the
idea. He's also a little fearful, because you can never be sure
your idea will be right, but this is his own creation he's dealing
with.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The figure in ``Phenomenon'' even has wild Einsteinian hair,
still youthfully brown, for Einstein was only in his 20s when he
conceived of special relativity.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Spain in 1908, Varo came by her interest in science
patrilineally. Her father was a hydraulic engineer who encouraged
his daughter's early display of artistic talent but drilled her in
the rigors of draftsmanship and the correct use of the rule,
carpenter's square and triangle. She studied art in Spain and
France and became immersed in the Surrealism movement.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the Fascists and the Nazis, she found her way to Mexico,
where she married Walter Gruen, an Austrian emigre who made a small
fortune and told her, ``If you want, all you have to do is paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Paint is what she did, creating large, intricate canvases using
a brush with only three bristles. She painted cats made of ferns
and women so miserably domesticated that their hands and feet had
become chair arms and chair legs. Her scenes seethe with anima and
organic matter _ lichen, fungi, keratin, dragonflies.
</P>
<P>
   Varo was an avid reader of science fiction and respectable
popularizers of science like Fred Hoyle and Isaac Asimov. From them
she learned about cosmology, evolution and genetics. In one
painting, ``The Flutist,'' Friedman said, the musician can be seen
as a stand-in for Charles Darwin, who is constructing a tower _ the
theory of evolution _ from stones containing fossils of ancient
trilobites, fish, ferns, spiral ammonites.
</P>
<P>
   Music to Varo served as an organizing principle, Friedman
observed, and so it is that strands from the flute are helping to
array the fossil record into the mighty tower of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Harmony,'' the distinctly androgynous scientist is seeking
to create a ``theory of everything,'' again using music, a musical
staff, as an organizing device. The scientist strings onto the
staff vegetables, animals, stones, pyramids, a scrap of paper with
pi written out to six digits. Projecting from a wall near the
staff, the hand of chance, an essential ingredient in scientific
success, is helping the scientist by adding ingredients to the
composition in progress.
</P>
<P>
   In Friedman's view, Varo's most scientifically ambitious
painting is ``Creation of the Birds.'' A woman with the feathers
and face of an owl in one hand wields a paintbrush that extends
from a violin hanging where her heart should be. In her other hand
she holds a magnifying glass that refracts light from a star onto
the page where her bird-in-progress is about to fly away. A Rube
Goldberg-type apparatus collects stardust from another window and
transforms it into the red, yellow and blue pigments from which the
bird is drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, Varo portrays the three ingredients necessary for
the origin of life: matter, made up of complex molecules that
scientists have determined were formed by stellar fusion, deep in
the interiors of stars, thus her stardust becomes paint pigment;
energy, again the gift of suns, beaming from the star through the
magnifying glass and onto the page; and organization, the
anti-entropy principle, represented by the Owl Woman's
cardio-violin.
</P>
<P>
   And through Varo's profound artistry, the origin of life is
transformed, so that it can be seen for what it is: a warm-blooded
miracle, a song taking flight. &QL;

BRUISED BUT NOT BROKEN, TINA TURNER ROCKS ALONG

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indomitable and indefatigable, Tina Turner reigned at Madison
Square Garden on Friday night, defying time, pop fashion and any
man who would try to hold her down.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, 61, has long since staked out her archetype: the strong,
lusty woman who has grown tougher with every setback and every
betrayal. It's an archetype that is reinforced by her songs, her
autobiography, her leathery voice and her leonine presence.
Strutting across the stage in spike heels, shaking her blonde
tousled moptop, she sang, ``I may be bruised but I ain't broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Her set ranged through 40 years of music, including the first
song she recorded, ``A Fool in Love'' from 1960, a prescient wail
of pain about an irresistible, mistreating man. The rest of the set
was bipolar, swinging between vows and kiss-offs: ``Let's Stay
Together'' answered by ``What's Love Got to Do With It?''; ``Better
Be Good to Me'' followed by ``Heard It Through the Grapevine.''
Songs from her current album, ``Twenty Four Seven'' (Virgin),
either promised devotion or, more convincingly, sent a man packing
in ``When the Heartache Is Over'' and ``Absolutely Nothing's
Changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner became a superstar during the video era, and she has
mastered the rock spectacle. Her show included video screens,
fireworks, costume changes, moving sets and dancers who shook
everything sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   Turner danced, too, posing with hand on hip and shoulders thrown
back or prancing with quick coltish steps. She still wears
skin-tight clothes. Yet at the center of the extravaganza was her
voice: the bluesy rasp and yowl that sliced through blues-rock
guitar chords and snapped ballads to attention. She also sang the
Beatles' ``Help'' as a slow gospel supplication, confessing to
insecurity and longing without disguising her tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's voice has two modes, the ones she famously sums up as
``nice and easy'' _ a smoky purr _ and ``nice and rough'': the
rising, tearing tone that could clear city traffic for blocks
ahead. She turns quiet verses into sadder-but-wiser reflections or
clipped preacher's syncopations. Then, when a chorus leaps upward,
she combines torment and defiance, channeling a primal power.
</P>
<P>
   Turner is not about to become a grande dame anytime soon,
reflecting from a distance on past triumphs and heartbreak. The way
she sings, she's still a fierce contender in the battle of the
sexes.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Richie, who shared the bill, was oil to Turner's vinegar,
unctuously flattering the audience for remembering his songs after
he disappeared for most of the 1990s. He sang his hits from the
'70s and '80s, skillful genre exercises that never shied away from
a romantic bromide; the one new song was about Cinderella.
</P>
<P>
   The set was a reminder of Richie's variety, from the nasal funk
of the Commodores' ``Brick House'' to the heartland rock of
``Dancing on the Ceiling'' to countryish ballads like ``Easy'' to
his anticipation of current Latin pop, ``All Night Long.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice was warm and the band helped him milk the songs,
changing them from promises of romance to an unabashed courting of
the crowd and his dormant career.

 &HT;    AIRLINE QUALITY FELL IN 1999, REPORT FINDS
 &HT;    450&AMP;add. With AIRLINE-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The overall quality of U.S. air travel declined
last year, with consumer complaints doubling despite the industry's
promises to improve service, the annual Airline Quality Report said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing decline of the overall industry's quality
documents that the airline-sponsored plan to increase customer
service is failing,'' said Brent Bowen, co-author of the study and
director of the Aviation Institute at the University of Nebraska at
Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines was the best carrier in the nation, rising
from fifth place last year, according to the report for the major
domestic airlines.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways fell to sixth from the top spot the previous year,
and American Airlines fell to seventh, down from third place. Delta
Airlines was ranked fourth, rising one spot from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The report weighed U.S. Department of Transportation performance
data on on-time arrivals, involuntary denied boarding, mishandled
baggage and a combination of 11 customer complaint categories.
</P>
<P>
   Only the industry's baggage handling showed a slight improvement
over the previous year, falling to 5.08 errors per 1,000 passengers
from 5.16 per 1,000 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But on-time performance _ flights arriving within 15 minutes of
schedule _ slipped from 77.2 percent to 76.1 percent, and denied
boardings rose marginally from 0.87 per 10,000 passengers to 0.88.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the volume of consumer complaints increased by 130
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer complaints are on the rise because of the airlines'
inability to take complaints seriously, Bowen said. Many customers
are turning to the Department of Transportation, which recently
made it easier for consumers to file complaints on its
</P>
<P>
   Web site, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airlines still don't seem to get it'' that consumers want
basic services such as on-time service, said Dean Headly, co-author
of the study and associate professor of marketing at Wichita State
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do recognize that there there are problems and we are doing
something about them,'' said Diana Cronan, a spokeswoman for the
Air Transport Association, the trade association representing the
major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Cronan said criticism that the airlines' plan to improve service
is failing was ``unfair because the plan was implemented in
December and was only in effect for two weeks in 1999. We ask that
the flying public give us a chance and wait until the plan has been
in effect for a year before judging us.''

   Southwest recorded the third largest margin of improvement in
this year's report and had the lowest rate of customer complaints
of the 10 airlines surveyed. However, its on-time arrivals
percentage and customer complaint rates grew worse last year,
according the report.
</P>
<P>
   Delta suffered a decline in the areas of on-time arrivals,
mishandled baggage and customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways' rating fell more than any other major airline's. The
carrier's customer complaints were twice as frequent as its
counterparts'. Even though American Airlines improved its on-time
performance, the airline's 69.5 percent rate was the worst of all
the major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry's low performance, Bowen said, can be
attributed to poor management and dissatisfied workers at companies
such as United. He said airlines with fewer labor problems tend to
perform better, and those who don't spend enough money to satisfy
customers' needs tend to do poorly.
</P>
<P>
   The airline quality study is conducted annually by the Nebraska
aviation institute and the W. Frank Barton School of Business at
Wichita State University.
</P>
<P>
   Major airlines, according to the report, are those whose
operating revenue for a 12-month period is $1 billion or more.

 &HT;    AIRLINE QUALITY FELL IN 1999, REPORT FINDS
 &HT;    450&AMP;add. With AIRLINE-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)

   WASHINGTON _ The overall quality of U.S. air travel declined
last year, with consumer complaints doubling despite the industry's
promises to improve service, the annual Airline Quality Report said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing decline of the overall industry's quality
documents that the airline-sponsored plan to increase customer
service is failing,'' said Brent Bowen, co-author of the study and
director of the Aviation Institute at the University of Nebraska at
Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines was the best carrier in the nation, rising
from fifth place last year, according to the report for the major
domestic airlines.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways fell to sixth from the top spot the previous year,
and American Airlines fell to seventh, down from third place. Delta
Airlines was ranked fourth, rising one spot from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The report weighed U.S. Department of Transportation performance
data on on-time arrivals, involuntary denied boarding, mishandled
baggage and a combination of 11 customer complaint categories.
</P>
<P>
   Only the industry's baggage handling showed a slight improvement
over the previous year, falling to 5.08 errors per 1,000 passengers
from 5.16 per 1,000 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But on-time performance _ flights arriving within 15 minutes of
schedule _ slipped from 77.2 percent to 76.1 percent, and denied
boardings rose marginally from 0.87 per 10,000 passengers to 0.88.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the volume of consumer complaints increased by 130
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer complaints are on the rise because of the airlines'
inability to take complaints seriously, Bowen said. Many customers
are turning to the Department of Transportation, which recently

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fifty years ago, when he was 19, Edward J. Woodland
Jr. joined the Air Force. In Wyoming for basic training, he and
some of his fellow recruits gave blood samples for a study of strep
throat.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland, a retired security guard who lives in Washington, had
long since forgotten about that study. But he heard of it again in
February when he got a three-page letter from a government
scientist whose group had found the blood samples in a freezer in
Minneapolis, tested them for something entirely unrelated and
tracked him down after all these years. The hope was that Woodland
might provide vital clues to an abiding medical mystery: What is
the natural course of hepatitis C?
</P>
<P>
   Some hepatitis specialists say the virus is usually not very
worrisome. Others say that it is a terrifying national epidemic and
that everyone who is infected should be found and treated. But the
treatment is expensive, unpleasant and not very effective, so
medical experts feel an urgent need to discover just how bad the
disease is. Woodland and others in the study may help them find
out.
</P>
<P>
   Now Woodland sits erect in a narrow wooden chair in the office
of Leonard Seeff, the doctor who wrote the letter, having learned
for the first time the details of his extraordinary medical
situation.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew that the variety of hepatitis now known as hepatitis
C even existed 50 years ago, yet Woodland is living proof that it
did and that healthy young teen-agers were being infected. He is
also living proof that infection with hepatitis C need not be a
death knell, or even a threat to health. Millions of copies of the
virus still course through Woodland's bloodstream and burrow into
his liver. Yet, in defiance of conventional medical wisdom, he has
not had any overt signs of illness.
</P>
<P>
   For Seeff, the story of Woodland and a handful of his fellow
recruits is a cautionary tale for hepatitis researchers that raises
thorny questions about the study and treatment of hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists estimate that 3 million to 5 million Americans are
infected with the hepatitis C virus, which can smolder quietly in
the liver for decades before erupting as cirrhosis, liver failure
or liver cancer. Some were infected from blood transfusions in the
years before the early 1990s, when a blood test for the virus was
developed and came into use. Others got it from sharing
contaminated needles. It can also be transmitted sexually.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also people, like Woodland, who neither used drugs
nor had transfusions, who will never know how or when they became
infected. Since it can take years for symptoms to develop, most who
are infected do not know it.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that hepatitis C is a time bomb ready to explode in the
next few decades as hundreds of thousands of Americans, most of
whom do not know they are infected, become ill. Dr. C. Everett
Koop, the former surgeon general, who has campaigned to publicize
the dangers of hepatitis C, has called the disease a grave threat
to public health. ``Unless we do something about it soon,'' he has
written, ``it will kill more people than AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that while hepatitis C can be deadly, most people who
are infected with it either recover spontaneously or never become
ill in the first place. Most people carrying hepatitis C, they say,
live normal life spans and die of something other than liver
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you have hepatitis C doesn't mean your life is
ruined,'' said Dr. Miriam Alter, chief of the epidemiology section
at the hepatitis branch of the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But treatment for hepatitis C is far from ideal. Most patients
must spend a year injecting themselves with the drug interferon,
which both fights the virus and stimulates the immune system to
attack the virus, and taking ribavirin pills, a drug that
strengthens the effects of interferon.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs are unpleasant to take, causing flulike symptoms,
including fever, lethargy, malaise, and achiness. They can also
cause severe, even suicidal, depression. And they eradicate the
virus in only 30 percent to 40 percent of patients. For blacks,
like Woodland, the treatment rarely works, for reasons that remain
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors fall into two broad groups, said Dr. Harvey Alter, chief
of the infectious disease section at the National Institutes of
Health, who is not related to Dr. Miriam Alter. ``One group says
you cannot predict the outcome of hepatitis C, therefore it is
safest to treat everyone,'' Harvey Alter said. ``The other group
feels that most people are not badly affected and that this disease
progresses slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   If doctors follow the patients, he said, ``it is safe to wait
and see if there is significant progression,'' before starting
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dilemma is only because the treatment is difficult,''
Alter said. ``If we had a safe and effective oral treatment, we
would treat everybody.'' But, for now, the question of whether to
treat, and whom to treat, hinges on the larger question of how bad
hepatitis C is. And that question hinges on studies of people like
Woodland.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, research on hepatitis C has focused on patients who
sought help from liver specialists. Often, they were the sickest
patients, suffering from liver failure or liver cancer. Their
experience shows how serious hepatitis C infections can be. But
researchers have no idea if they are typical.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have traced the virus and its effects in people
who were infected through contaminated blood about two decades ago.
In those studies, very few infected people turned out to be sick,
but that might be because the studies have not gone on long enough
or because patients who might have gotten liver disease died first
of the diseases that led to the transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed there was no way to learn the true picture, since no
one knew how to find people who had been infected so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then, by chance, Dr. Richard Miller, a doctor and medical
epidemiologist at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in
Washington, learned that blood had been saved from the strep throat
study.
</P>
<P>
   From 1948 to 1954, while strep infections raged at the Fort
Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, doctors there
conducted a landmark study that eventually proved that treating the
bacterial infections with antibiotics could prevent rheumatic
fever, a grave heart condition that can follow strep throat.
</P>
<P>
   The blood samples, from 9,427 recruits, ended up in a freezer in
Cleveland, where the lead strep investigator, Dr. Charles
Rammelkamp, had moved. Twenty years ago, when Rammelkamp was ready
to retire, he offered the blood to Dr. Edward L. Kaplan, a strep
researcher who is at the University of Minnesota. If Kaplan had not
wanted the blood, it would have been discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan used freezer trucks that normally carry frozen pizzas to
bring the blood back to Minnesota. To store the 83 wire trays, each
holding about 700 vials of blood, he and his 10-year-old son went
to Sears and bought freezers. ``The salesman asked me if I owned a
restaurant,'' Kaplan recalled. He kept the blood and dreamed of
using it some day.
</P>
<P>
   Miller invited Seeff, who is senior scientist for hepatitis C
research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases and a liver disease specialist at the Veterans
Affairs Medical Center in Washington, to help use the blood to ask
whether the hepatitis C virus had existed 50 years ago and, if it
had, what had happened to people who had been infected.
</P>
<P>
   All they had to do was test the blood and track down anyone who
had been infected. Miller, who had moved to the medical follow-up
agency of the National Academy of Sciences, could get death
certificates and other crucial medical information.
</P>
<P>
   First, Seeff and Miller consulted with ethicists to determine
whether this was the right thing to do. Miller was told that there
would be no problem but Seeff got conflicting opinions. Some
ethicists told him to go ahead but others said he should first get
permission from each man, a task that Seeff concluded was
logistically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   There was no policy at the National Institutes of Health
prohibiting the study, so Seeff decided to go ahead with it. The
investigators focused on the 8,568 men in the study who had Social
Security numbers, allowing federal scientists to trace them.
</P>
<P>
   Blood tests showed that 17 men had been infected with the
hepatitis C virus when they were at that Air Force base during the
Korean War, the same percentage as is found among healthy young
military recruits today. Seven of the men had since died, but only
one had had chronic liver disease. He had died of liver disease 42
years after his stint at the Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the others? Two had no known addresses, but eight
did.
</P>
<P>
   For a year and a half, Seeff worked on a letter to send these
men, consulting with ethicists and other doctors, writing draft
after draft. He knew the risks: The men could be repelled by the
idea of government scientists tracking them down after all these
years, they might simply throw the letter away, they might be
terrified by the news that doctors had found a dread virus in their
50-year-old blood.
</P>
<P>
   The final version was almost bland, calling the quest ``a very
meaningful study'' and ``this important study.'' The men were told,
``Your contribution to the project may help not only yourself but
also many others who might have persistent hepatitis C or who will
become infected in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Feb. 1 the letters went out by Federal Express. Two
days later, the first man called. Within a week, Seeff had heard
from all eight. All but one, who had had a stroke, were willing to
be examined. The three men tested so far are still infected with
hepatitis C, Seeff said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland was the first to come in for testing and his results
were totally unexpected. They showed 3.18 million copies of the
hepatitis C virus in his blood and slightly abnormal liver enzymes,
indicating an infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am more amazed by this than by almost anything I have ever
seen,'' Seeff said. ``This man has had 50 years of infection,'' he
said. Yet, he continued, Woodland seems to have simply lived with
the virus, with no signs of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Seeff was not quite sure what to say to Woodland. If Woodland
had simply showed up in Seeff's medical office that day, without
the old blood sample indicating that he had had hepatitis C for 50
years, Seeff knew what he would have done. ``I would say, `Let's do
a liver biopsy and if he has cirrhosis, let's treat him.'''
</P>
<P>
   But, Seeff said: ``Here's a man who's 69 years old. He's been
positive for 50 years. Treatment couldn't have done a better job.
The question is, do you impose treatment on him?''
</P>
<P>
   Seeff put the choice to Woodland. While Woodland sat in his
office that rainy afternoon late last month, Seeff nervously told
him that he still had hepatitis C and that the only way to know if
the virus had damaged his liver was to have a biopsy. He asked
Woodland to think it over and to get back to him.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland was outwardly calm. ``I've got to think about it,'' he
said. ``If it's best for me to have treatment, I'll get
treatment.'' He signed up to be a patient at the medical center and
went home.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said some scientists had criticized the study because it
found so few men with hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's a small number,'' Kaplan said. ``And yes, one could
be critical of the small number. But it goes against a pervasive
thought that the diagnosis of hepatitis C borders on a death
warrant. If it does nothing more than to say to people that we
should look at that assumption again, then it has served its
purpose.''

<P>
   Exercise addicts crave an exercise ``fix'' the same way that
alcoholics crave a drink. In an age of absorption in self, sex and
body, some push the cultural ideal of a perfect body too far by
obsessing about exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Like a drug or alcohol addict, the exercise addict loses control
and no longer exercises by choice. The daily fix of a workout
becomes obligatory, even if the addict is sick or injured.
Improvement, recordkeeping, calorie and scale-counting become
compulsive behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, Melinda Rau would fume if someone else had
already picked up the morning paper. She was angry because she had
lost the chance to burn a few extra calories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't stop moving,'' says Rau, a recovering anorexic and
exercise addict. She would park her car two complexes over and walk
to her apartment, then take her grocery bags in one by one. ``I
would wear a pedometer to make sure I was walking eight miles over
the course of a day,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Rau was suffering from what is known as ``exercise addiction,''
also known as ``activity disorder.'' She became consumed with
calculating how many bicep curls had been performed, staircases
taken and steps walked. Parking on the far side of the supermarket
parking lot was ingrained.
</P>
<P>
   Rau's obsessive pace began in high school as a track star. ``If
I ran I could burn more calories, and I could eat more,'' says Rau,
who would walk four miles before school on the days of track meets.
As a star athlete, she was lionized and congratulated.
</P>
<P>
   Food consumption and fear of weight gain became parallel
obsessions until Rau had all the signs of anorexia nervosa, a
psychological disorder suffered by both sexes that is often
characterized by intentionally denying the body nutrition. The
person literally starves, becoming progressively more gaunt and
waif-like.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say compulsive exercise can trigger a range of physical
and mental health problems: eating disorders, stress fractures,
joint injuries, ligament damage, immune system weakening, and, in
women, menstrual irregularity are among them.
</P>
<P>
   Concentration at work or school can be affected. Abuse of
steroids and weight loss supplements aggravate problems.
</P>
<P>
   When exercise addicts are prevented from a sweat session, they
suffer withdrawal symptoms like irritability, sleeplessness and
overwhelming guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists still aren't sure what causes exercise addiction.
Some suggest that people become addicted to the body's release of
endorphins that provide a feeling of elation after prolonged
exercise. Endorphins, naturally occurring brain chemicals, are
similar to the opiate morphine.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts, including licensed therapist Carolyn Costin,
say the source of the problem runs much deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Costin is a founder and clinical director at Monte Nido
Treatment Center in Malibu, Calif., a private recovery facility
that aims to heal women suffering from anorexia, bulimia, and
exercise addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Costin's own recovery from anorexia informs her own approach to
patient treatment, which is highly individualized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being able to be really intimate with people and
talk about their problems, they use the exercise,'' says Costin.
``They exercise past the point of any positive goals. 'More is
better.'''
</P>
<P>
   Costin says society at large pushes susceptible people to go
overboard in pursuit of an idealized, bodily perfection that is
unrealistic for most. ``There's more gyms, more magazines on
fitness, more billboards about it,'' observes Costin. For exercise
addicts, hi-tech tools add to the problem: ``We have increased ways
to measure things like body fat percentage. Today it's 45 minutes
on the treadmill, tomorrow, it's 50.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in therapy, Rau says she was symbolically running from her
problems. ``I didn't get along with my family, couldn't connect on
an emotional level,'' says Rau who, typical of sufferers, battled
repressed anger and fought depression. ``I couldn't hold a
conversation because my mind was calculating calories.''
</P>
<P>
   Costin says people can overcome exercise addiction with
cognitive and drug therapies. Costin's intervention team helps
sufferers re-learn a lifestyle with healthy amounts of exercise,
balanced food shopping and preparation, and eating.
</P>
<P>
   Talk therapy in individual and group settings gives recovering
addicts the opportunity to deal with unresolved conflict and find
other pursuits that lead to a more balanced life.
</P>
<P>
   After intense treatment, Melinda Rau is reaching a healthier
weight and is finally able to sit still without feeling guilty,
whether talking to family or reading the paper. Her outlook has
profoundly changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living life is not about measuring how much you've done or
what you are; it's about being in the moment,'' she says.

THE FLY PEOPLE MAKE HISTORY ON THE FRONTIERS OF GENETICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Mass., N.Y.)   (Science Times)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dung beetle was worshiped by the ancient Egyptians, and the
honeybee has always had its admirers, but only one insect has a
computer database, its own CD-ROM and an international cult of
5,000 followers, each with a PhD.
</P>
<P>
   So minutely has that insect, the Drosophila fruit fly, been
scrutinized that every bristle on its tiny head has a scientific
name.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the fly became the second animal to have its full
genome decoded. (The first was its leading rival for biologists'
affections, the laboratory roundworm.) Fly people, as Drosophila
researchers call themselves, were presented at their annual meeting
in Pittsburgh last month with a CD-ROM from the Celera Corp.
containing the 120 million units so far identified in the fly's
DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The fly has attained this prominence in human affairs because it
is one of the principal model organisms studied by biologists as a
means of understanding the general design of life.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the unity of evolution, the fly's genes and those of
people overlap considerably. Fly people, who are passionate about
the merits of their favorite organism, are easily provoked into
confessing that they think of people as large flies that lack
wings.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one class of researcher to whom fly people cannot
help feeling slightly superior, it is worm people, the students of
the C. elegans roundworm.
</P>
<P>
   The fly and the worm are quite similar as model organisms, which
is perhaps one reason for the rivalry. Their genes are easily
manipulated, in contrast with those of the mouse, another leading
model organism, which seems uncomfortably similar to people at the
DNA level but is very cumbersome to manipulate genetically.
</P>
<P>
   When the fly's genome was decoded, fly biologists rushed to
calculate how many known human disease genes had direct
counterparts in Drosophila and the C. elegans worm. Their summary
table published in Science magazine last month, showing a decided
advantage for the fly, caused no little offense in the worm
community. ``Very fly-centric,'' complained Dr. Gary Ruvkun, a worm
biologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A considerable puzzle in the fly-centric universe has been the
surprisingly small size of the Drosophila genome. The fly is a
complex miniature machine, with wings, blood and kidney, and a
brain that is powerful enough to compute flight activity and
elaborate behavior patterns. Surely it needs far more genes than
the worm, a microscopic little tube made of exactly 959 cells.
</P>
<P>
   According to those who decoded the worm's genome, evolution has
found it necessary to write 18,424 programming instructions, aka
genes, to develop, operate and maintain a worm. But only 13,601
genes, nearly 5,000 fewer, have been detected in the fly's genome.
</P>
<P>
   This embarrassment has yet to be explained, and is only partly
relieved by reports that the worm's gene number has recently been
revised downward to about 16,000 genes.
</P>
<P>
   The little fly has performed several outstanding services to
biology during the 93 years of its laboratory employment. Its
adoptive father, Dr. Thomas H. Morgan, a Columbia University
professor, saw that its quick life cycle and prolific offspring
made the fly an ideal test bed for exploring Mendel's laws of
genetics, which had been rediscovered a few years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The fly was also inexpensive compared with other laboratory
animals, a fact not lost on Morgan, who was something of a
cheapskate. The flies could be raised in containers no more
complicated than a milk bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to legend, he and his students stole empty
half-pints from milk boxes on Manhattan stoops on their
early-morning walks to the lab, and they lifted more from the
Columbia student cafeteria,'' Jonathan Weiner wrote in ``Time,
Love, Memory'' (Knopf, 1999), an engaging joint biography of the
fly and one of its leading students, Dr. Seymour Benzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgan laboratory laid the foundation of modern genetics in
discovering that genes are arranged in linear array on the
chromosomes and that their order can be mapped by tracking the
pattern in which genetic traits are co-inherited in the progeny. If
two genes lie very close to each other on a chromosome, they will
rarely be separated when the chromosomes exchange DNA segments, as
happens when egg or sperm cells are generated.
</P>
<P>
   But if the two genes lie at opposite ends of a chromosome, they
are much more likely to be inherited separately (some offspring
will have one, some the other). Working with the first few mutant
flies that Morgan had discovered, his student Alfred Sturtevant
showed how a map of the genes' position on a chromosome could be
constructed directly from the co-inheritance patterns.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fly fell into temporary eclipse after the discovery of DNA
in 1953. Geneticists needed much simpler organisms, like bacteria
and the viruses that prey on them, in which to work out the
molecule-level events of DNA metabolism. But when the bacterial
type of cell was well enough understood, biologists came flocking
back to the fly to gain an understanding of animal cells.
</P>
<P>
   The fly's second great gift to biology was essentially to crack
the great mystery of how a many-celled complex animal develops from
a single egg cell. Though the frog and the mouse deserve credit
too, it was the fly that revealed the basic system of genes and
signaling molecules that set up the founding patterns in the
developing embryo and direct the development of different organs in
their proper sites.
</P>
<P>
   These master patterning genes have immediately recognizable
cousins in vertebrates like humans, although there are somewhat
more of them. It looks as though those big flies without wings are
assembled by just the same genetic mechanisms, though with more
fripperies and curlicues, as Drosophila.
</P>
<P>
   The fly seems in the act of parting with a third amazing gift,
though the package is still being unwrapped: the rules that govern
the inheritance of behavior. Evolution has taken great care in
designing every physical feature of the fly's body, so no less
might be expected of the fly's behavior, which is just as important
to its survival.
</P>
<P>
   Benzer and his students at the California Institute of
Technology discovered the first genes that affect the biological
clock, which is a kind of behavior, and more recently other fly
people have discovered two elaborate cascades of genes that between
them seem to control many aspects of the fly's sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The little creature's courtship ritual is not so entirely
different from the human variety. The male taps on his inamorata
with his forelegs, sings her a song by extending and vibrating one
of his wings, and then tries to mate with her. She may accept the
proposition or respond with a buzz, a gesture needing no
translation.
</P>
<P>
   Many if not all of these behaviors are controlled by specific
genes, chiefly two known as fruitless and dissatisfaction.
Biologists name genes inversely, some would say perversely, by
describing what the organism cannot do after one of its genes has
been rendered defective with a mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Male flies with a mutation in their fruitless gene cannot
perform the courtship song correctly. Their sexual orientation is
deranged and they will court each other rather than females (hence
``fruitless''). Females with a defective dissatisfaction gene
resist copulation. Further details about the fly's sexual hang-ups
and much else besides can be found in flybase, the electronic
encyclopedia of fly lore, at flybase.bio.indiana.edu.
</P>
<P>
   If each step in the fly's courtship is choreographed in its
genes, are the flies just miniature automata with no freedom of
action? And if so much of the fly's behavior is under tight genetic
control, how much of human behavior is also framed by the genes?
</P>
<P>
   The decoding of the fly's genome opens out vast new avenues for
fly people to explore. Only some 2,783 genes are recorded in
flybase, the fruit of 93 years of fly person labor. The genome
sequencers found all but five (and some or all of these five may be
erroneous), and another 10,823 genes besides. The role of about
half of the fly's 13,601 genes can be guessed, because their DNA
sequences resemble those of genes whose purpose is known, but 22
percent of the genes match nothing in the data bases.
</P>
<P>
   Even when roles have been assigned to all of the fly's presently
predicted genes, Drosophilists will still be one major step away
from the total definition of the fly. Imagine having a full list of
parts for a Boeing 747 but not a single instruction for how to
assemble them. Drosophila melanogaster has, perhaps, a fourth great
gift of knowledge still concealed within its frail, miraculous
body.

 &HT;    Mammoth medical database contains millions of articles
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your doctor hands you _ or your spouse, or your parent, or your
child _ a difficult, unexpected diagnosis. Suddenly you need to
know as much as possible, as quickly as possible, about a disease
or condition you had barely heard of yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   What do you do? In the data wilderness of the World Wide Web,
where do you go?
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start, to see what has been written about
diseases and to investigate the latest in treatments and research,
is the mother and father of all medical databases: the National
Library of Medicine, a division of the federal National Institutes
of Health. The library itself is in Bethesda, Md., but its content
_ literally millions of articles on aspects of medicine, science
and health care _ is available online at www.nlm.nih.gov.
</P>
<P>
   A cautionary note: NLM searches can be rewarding, but they
aren't easy. Several search programs have been written to help
navigate it. For a basic introduction, with links to explanations
and tutorials in English and several other languages, begin at
www.nnlm.nlm.nih.gov

 &HT;    Africa an emotional challenge for Basinger
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vanity Fair's ($3.95) Leslie Bennetts profiles Georgia native
Kim Basinger this month on the eve of the actress' starring role in
``I Dreamed of Africa.'' Despite her Oscar for ``L.A.
Confidential,'' Basinger still hasn't gotten the respect she
deserves, Bennetts writes. That may change with the new film based
on Kuki Gallmann's best-selling book about her experiences in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Gallmann and her husband moved to Kenya in 1972 to establish a
farm. However, her husband died in a car crash. Then her son died
from the bite of a puff adder. Basinger, who portrays Gallmann in
the film, says, ``There's not an emotion I didn't get to play....''
</P>
<P>
   The woman who hails from Athens, Ga., also talks about her
volatile relationship with husband Alec Baldwin and his attempts to
turn what he describes as ``a Tennessee Williams character'' into a
soccer mom.
</P>
<P>
   Other must-read pieces include Christopher Hitchens' reflections
on ``The Great Gatsby'' on the novel's 75th anniversary, and an
excerpt from a new book, ``In the Heart of the Sea,'' a gripping
true-life account of a whale attack that inspired Herman Melville's
``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mixed bag: Talk ($3.50) has yet to reach the level of Vanity
Fair, but you can't say that Tina Brown doesn't try to offer
something for everybody. The May issue features a very good cover
story on Russell Crowe and his role in the soon-to-be-released film
``Gladiator,'' and solid articles on Tony Blair and his legacy and
Rupert Murdoch's renegade daughter Liz.
</P>
<P>
   The fluff in between is entertaining and uneven. Susie Orbach's
pop-psychology analysis of why women hate men is better suited for
Cosmo or Redbook. Sam Sifton's observations on why women are
attracted to men who are ``just gay enough'' is edgy and amusing.
How do you know if you're just gay enough? You own an Eames chair,
you act like a young Marlon Brando and you never miss ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  All about Elian: As the furor over Elian Gonzalez intensifies,
Time ($3.50) and Newsweek ($3.50) weigh in with cover stories on
the tug of war between the boy's father and his relatives in Miami.
Time's Lance Morrow makes an interesting point in his essay on
``The Second-Class Parent.'' If it had been Juan Miguel Gonzalez
who died, and the mother waiting back in Cuba, Morrow writes,
``Elian would have been sent back to her immediately, on the
premise that the mother-child bond trumps politics.'' Newsweek,
meanwhile, offers a glimpse of what kind of life Elian would have
back in Cuba. On one hand, he would have a nurturing life free of
the kind of crime that exists in Miami. On the other hand, although
his father is relatively well-off by Cuban standards, there would
be chronic shortages and limited prospects. And no Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Domestic affairs: Barbara Ehrenreich kicked up a dust storm
with her Harper's ($4.25) article ``Maid to Order,'' in which she
referred to the affluents' ``degradation'' of domestic workers.
Ehrenreich, who says she does most of her own cleaning, notes that
although the feminist revolution has resulted in more domestic
task-sharing between husbands and wives, women still do most of the
work. Cleaning services help ease the tension, she says, but adds
that ``the micro-defeat of feminism has created the ``sudden
emergence of a servant class'' beholden to a tiny overclass.
Ehrenreich was accused by writers at Salon and other media of being
anti-labor and of not understanding that cleaning houses was no
more demeaning than other work.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In sync: Jezebel ($3.95) tunes in to the city's music scene in
a package on Atlanta's best DJs, local bands on the rise and a
timeline of Georgia talent. Among the diamonds in the rough are
Massinfluence, Monochrome, Mandarico, Lift, 6 Piece and Steep. If
you haven't heard them (or heard of them), Jezebel notes, chances
are you will.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Organized anarchy: The New Yorker ($3) examines the coalition
of activists that disrupted the World Trade Organization's meetings
in Seattle last fall and finds it to be an ``amalgam of political
theater and ground-level organizing.'' Largely co-ordinated via the
Internet, the coalition plans to protest the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank on Sunday in Washington. One of the
organizers, 27-year-old Juliette Beck, explains the group's mission
as an attempt to ``drag these institutions out into the sunlight of
public scrutiny, where they belong. They'll shrivel up like
Dracula!''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fifty years ago, when he was 19, Edward J. Woodland
Jr. joined the Air Force. In Wyoming for basic training, he and
some of his fellow recruits gave blood samples for a study of strep
throat.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland, a retired security guard who lives in Washington, had
long since forgotten about that study. But he heard of it again in
February when he got a three-page letter from a government
scientist whose group had found the blood samples in a freezer in
Minneapolis, tested them for something entirely unrelated and
tracked him down after all these years. The hope was that Woodland
might provide vital clues to an abiding medical mystery: What is
the natural course of hepatitis C?
</P>
<P>
   Some hepatitis specialists say the virus is usually not very
worrisome. Others say that it is a terrifying national epidemic and
that everyone who is infected should be found and treated. But the
treatment is expensive, unpleasant and not very effective, so
medical experts feel an urgent need to discover just how bad the
disease is. Woodland and others in the study may help them find
out.
</P>
<P>
   Now Woodland sits erect in a narrow wooden chair in the office
of Leonard Seeff, the doctor who wrote the letter, having learned
for the first time the details of his extraordinary medical
situation.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew that the variety of hepatitis now known as hepatitis
C even existed 50 years ago, yet Woodland is living proof that it
did and that healthy young teen-agers were being infected. He is
also living proof that infection with hepatitis C need not be a
death knell, or even a threat to health. Millions of copies of the
virus still course through Woodland's bloodstream and burrow into
his liver. Yet, in defiance of conventional medical wisdom, he has
not had any overt signs of illness.
</P>
<P>
   For Seeff, the story of Woodland and a handful of his fellow
recruits is a cautionary tale for hepatitis researchers that raises
thorny questions about the study and treatment of hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists estimate that 3 million to 5 million Americans are
infected with the hepatitis C virus, which can smolder quietly in
the liver for decades before erupting as cirrhosis, liver failure
or liver cancer. Some were infected from blood transfusions in the
years before the early 1990s, when a blood test for the virus was
developed and came into use. Others got it from sharing
contaminated needles. It can also be transmitted sexually.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also people, like Woodland, who neither used drugs
nor had transfusions, who will never know how or when they became
infected. Since it can take years for symptoms to develop, most who
are infected do not know it.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that hepatitis C is a time bomb ready to explode in the
next few decades as hundreds of thousands of Americans, most of
whom do not know they are infected, become ill. Dr. C. Everett
Koop, the former surgeon general, who has campaigned to publicize
the dangers of hepatitis C, has called the disease a grave threat
to public health. ``Unless we do something about it soon,'' he has
written, ``it will kill more people than AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that while hepatitis C can be deadly, most people who
are infected with it either recover spontaneously or never become
ill in the first place. Most people carrying hepatitis C, they say,
live normal life spans and die of something other than liver
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you have hepatitis C doesn't mean your life is
ruined,'' said Dr. Miriam Alter, chief of the epidemiology section
at the hepatitis branch of the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But treatment for hepatitis C is far from ideal. Most patients
must spend a year injecting themselves with the drug interferon,
which both fights the virus and stimulates the immune system to
attack the virus, and taking ribavirin pills, a drug that
strengthens the effects of interferon.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs are unpleasant to take, causing flulike symptoms,
including fever, lethargy, malaise, and achiness. They can also
cause severe, even suicidal, depression. And they eradicate the
virus in only 30 percent to 40 percent of patients. For blacks,
like Woodland, the treatment rarely works, for reasons that remain
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors fall into two broad groups, said Dr. Harvey Alter, chief
of the infectious disease section at the National Institutes of
Health, who is not related to Dr. Miriam Alter. ``One group says
you cannot predict the outcome of hepatitis C, therefore it is
safest to treat everyone,'' Harvey Alter said. ``The other group
feels that most people are not badly affected and that this disease
progresses slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   If doctors follow the patients, he said, ``it is safe to wait
and see if there is significant progression,'' before starting
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dilemma is only because the treatment is difficult,''
Alter said. ``If we had a safe and effective oral treatment, we
would treat everybody.'' But, for now, the question of whether to
treat, and whom to treat, hinges on the larger question of how bad
hepatitis C is. And that question hinges on studies of people like
Woodland.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, research on hepatitis C has focused on patients who
sought help from liver specialists. Often, they were the sickest
patients, suffering from liver failure or liver cancer. Their
experience shows how serious hepatitis C infections can be. But
researchers have no idea if they are typical.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have traced the virus and its effects in people
who were infected through contaminated blood about two decades ago.
In those studies, very few infected people turned out to be sick,
but that might be because the studies have not gone on long enough
or because patients who might have gotten liver disease died first
of the diseases that led to the transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed there was no way to learn the true picture, since no
one knew how to find people who had been infected so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then, by chance, Dr. Richard Miller, a doctor and medical
epidemiologist at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in
Washington, learned that blood had been saved from the strep throat
study.
</P>
<P>
   From 1948 to 1954, while strep infections raged at the Fort
Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, doctors there
conducted a landmark study that eventually proved that treating the
bacterial infections with antibiotics could prevent rheumatic
fever, a grave heart condition that can follow strep throat.
</P>
<P>
   The blood samples, from 9,427 recruits, ended up in a freezer in
Cleveland, where the lead strep investigator, Dr. Charles
Rammelkamp, had moved. Twenty years ago, when Rammelkamp was ready
to retire, he offered the blood to Dr. Edward L. Kaplan, a strep
researcher who is at the University of Minnesota. If Kaplan had not
wanted the blood, it would have been discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan used freezer trucks that normally carry frozen pizzas to
bring the blood back to Minnesota. To store the 83 wire trays, each
holding about 700 vials of blood, he and his 10-year-old son went
to Sears and bought freezers. ``The salesman asked me if I owned a
restaurant,'' Kaplan recalled. He kept the blood and dreamed of
using it some day.
</P>
<P>
   Miller invited Seeff, who is senior scientist for hepatitis C
research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases and a liver disease specialist at the Veterans
Affairs Medical Center in Washington, to help use the blood to ask
whether the hepatitis C virus had existed 50 years ago and, if it
had, what had happened to people who had been infected.
</P>
<P>
   All they had to do was test the blood and track down anyone who
had been infected. Miller, who had moved to the medical follow-up
agency of the National Academy of Sciences, could get death
certificates and other crucial medical information.
</P>
<P>
   First, Seeff and Miller consulted with ethicists to determine
whether this was the right thing to do. Miller was told that there
would be no problem but Seeff got conflicting opinions. Some
ethicists told him to go ahead but others said he should first get
permission from each man, a task that Seeff concluded was
logistically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   There was no policy at the National Institutes of Health
prohibiting the study, so Seeff decided to go ahead with it. The
investigators focused on the 8,568 men in the study who had Social
Security numbers, allowing federal scientists to trace them.
</P>
<P>
   Blood tests showed that 17 men had been infected with the
hepatitis C virus when they were at that Air Force base during the
Korean War, the same percentage as is found among healthy young
military recruits today. Seven of the men had since died, but only
one had had chronic liver disease. He had died of liver disease 42
years after his stint at the Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the others? Two had no known addresses, but eight
did.
</P>
<P>
   For a year and a half, Seeff worked on a letter to send these
men, consulting with ethicists and other doctors, writing draft
after draft. He knew the risks: The men could be repelled by the
idea of government scientists tracking them down after all these
years, they might simply throw the letter away, they might be
terrified by the news that doctors had found a dread virus in their
50-year-old blood.
</P>
<P>
   The final version was almost bland, calling the quest ``a very
meaningful study'' and ``this important study.'' The men were told,
``Your contribution to the project may help not only yourself but
also many others who might have persistent hepatitis C or who will
become infected in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Feb. 1 the letters went out by Federal Express. Two
days later, the first man called. Within a week, Seeff had heard
from all eight. All but one, who had had a stroke, were willing to
be examined. The three men tested so far are still infected with
hepatitis C, Seeff said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland was the first to come in for testing and his results
were totally unexpected. They showed 3.18 million copies of the
hepatitis C virus in his blood and slightly abnormal liver enzymes,
indicating an infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am more amazed by this than by almost anything I have ever
seen,'' Seeff said. ``This man has had 50 years of infection,'' he
said. Yet, he continued, Woodland seems to have simply lived with
the virus, with no signs of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Seeff was not quite sure what to say to Woodland. If Woodland
had simply showed up in Seeff's medical office that day, without
the old blood sample indicating that he had had hepatitis C for 50
years, Seeff knew what he would have done. ``I would say, `Let's do
a liver biopsy and if he has cirrhosis, let's treat him.'''
</P>
<P>
   But, Seeff said: ``Here's a man who's 69 years old. He's been
positive for 50 years. Treatment couldn't have done a better job.
The question is, do you impose treatment on him?''
</P>
<P>
   Seeff put the choice to Woodland. While Woodland sat in his
office that rainy afternoon late last month, Seeff nervously told
him that he still had hepatitis C and that the only way to know if
the virus had damaged his liver was to have a biopsy. He asked
Woodland to think it over and to get back to him.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland was outwardly calm. ``I've got to think about it,'' he
said. ``If it's best for me to have treatment, I'll get
treatment.'' He signed up to be a patient at the medical center and
went home.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said some scientists had criticized the study because it
found so few men with hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's a small number,'' Kaplan said. ``And yes, one could
be critical of the small number. But it goes against a pervasive
thought that the diagnosis of hepatitis C borders on a death
warrant. If it does nothing more than to say to people that we
should look at that assumption again, then it has served its
purpose.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The dung beetle was worshiped by the ancient Egyptians, and the
honeybee has always had its admirers, but only one insect has a
computer database, its own CD-ROM and an international cult of
5,000 followers, each with a PhD.
</P>
<P>
   So minutely has that insect, the Drosophila fruit fly, been
scrutinized that every bristle on its tiny head has a scientific
name.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the fly became the second animal to have its full
genome decoded. (The first was its leading rival for biologists'
affections, the laboratory roundworm.) Fly people, as Drosophila
researchers call themselves, were presented at their annual meeting
in Pittsburgh last month with a CD-ROM from the Celera Corp.
containing the 120 million units so far identified in the fly's
DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The fly has attained this prominence in human affairs because it
is one of the principal model organisms studied by biologists as a
means of understanding the general design of life.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the unity of evolution, the fly's genes and those of
people overlap considerably. Fly people, who are passionate about
the merits of their favorite organism, are easily provoked into
confessing that they think of people as large flies that lack
wings.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one class of researcher to whom fly people cannot
help feeling slightly superior, it is worm people, the students of
the C. elegans roundworm.
</P>
<P>
   The fly and the worm are quite similar as model organisms, which
is perhaps one reason for the rivalry. Their genes are easily
manipulated, in contrast with those of the mouse, another leading
model organism, which seems uncomfortably similar to people at the
DNA level but is very cumbersome to manipulate genetically.
</P>
<P>
   When the fly's genome was decoded, fly biologists rushed to
calculate how many known human disease genes had direct
counterparts in Drosophila and the C. elegans worm. Their summary
table published in Science magazine last month, showing a decided
advantage for the fly, caused no little offense in the worm
community. ``Very fly-centric,'' complained Dr. Gary Ruvkun, a worm
biologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A considerable puzzle in the fly-centric universe has been the
surprisingly small size of the Drosophila genome. The fly is a
complex miniature machine, with wings, blood and kidney, and a
brain that is powerful enough to compute flight activity and
elaborate behavior patterns. Surely it needs far more genes than
the worm, a microscopic little tube made of exactly 959 cells.
</P>
<P>
   According to those who decoded the worm's genome, evolution has
found it necessary to write 18,424 programming instructions, aka
genes, to develop, operate and maintain a worm. But only 13,601
genes, nearly 5,000 fewer, have been detected in the fly's genome.
</P>
<P>
   This embarrassment has yet to be explained, and is only partly
relieved by reports that the worm's gene number has recently been
revised downward to about 16,000 genes.
</P>
<P>
   The little fly has performed several outstanding services to
biology during the 93 years of its laboratory employment. Its
adoptive father, Dr. Thomas H. Morgan, a Columbia University
professor, saw that its quick life cycle and prolific offspring
made the fly an ideal test bed for exploring Mendel's laws of
genetics, which had been rediscovered a few years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The fly was also inexpensive compared with other laboratory
animals, a fact not lost on Morgan, who was something of a
cheapskate. The flies could be raised in containers no more
complicated than a milk bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to legend, he and his students stole empty
half-pints from milk boxes on Manhattan stoops on their
early-morning walks to the lab, and they lifted more from the
Columbia student cafeteria,'' Jonathan Weiner wrote in ``Time,
Love, Memory'' (Knopf, 1999), an engaging joint biography of the
fly and one of its leading students, Dr. Seymour Benzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgan laboratory laid the foundation of modern genetics in
discovering that genes are arranged in linear array on the
chromosomes and that their order can be mapped by tracking the
pattern in which genetic traits are co-inherited in the progeny. If
two genes lie very close to each other on a chromosome, they will
rarely be separated when the chromosomes exchange DNA segments, as
happens when egg or sperm cells are generated.
</P>
<P>
   But if the two genes lie at opposite ends of a chromosome, they
are much more likely to be inherited separately (some offspring
will have one, some the other). Working with the first few mutant
flies that Morgan had discovered, his student Alfred Sturtevant
showed how a map of the genes' position on a chromosome could be
constructed directly from the co-inheritance patterns.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fly fell into temporary eclipse after the discovery of DNA
in 1953. Geneticists needed much simpler organisms, like bacteria
and the viruses that prey on them, in which to work out the
molecule-level events of DNA metabolism. But when the bacterial
type of cell was well enough understood, biologists came flocking
back to the fly to gain an understanding of animal cells.
</P>
<P>
   The fly's second great gift to biology was essentially to crack
the great mystery of how a many-celled complex animal develops from
a single egg cell. Though the frog and the mouse deserve credit
too, it was the fly that revealed the basic system of genes and
signaling molecules that set up the founding patterns in the
developing embryo and direct the development of different organs in
their proper sites.
</P>
<P>
   These master patterning genes have immediately recognizable
cousins in vertebrates like humans, although there are somewhat
more of them. It looks as though those big flies without wings are
assembled by just the same genetic mechanisms, though with more
fripperies and curlicues, as Drosophila.
</P>
<P>
   The fly seems in the act of parting with a third amazing gift,
though the package is still being unwrapped: the rules that govern
the inheritance of behavior. Evolution has taken great care in
designing every physical feature of the fly's body, so no less
might be expected of the fly's behavior, which is just as important
to its survival.
</P>
<P>
   Benzer and his students at the California Institute of
Technology discovered the first genes that affect the biological
clock, which is a kind of behavior, and more recently other fly
people have discovered two elaborate cascades of genes that between
them seem to control many aspects of the fly's sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The little creature's courtship ritual is not so entirely
different from the human variety. The male taps on his inamorata
with his forelegs, sings her a song by extending and vibrating one
of his wings, and then tries to mate with her. She may accept the
proposition or respond with a buzz, a gesture needing no
translation.
</P>
<P>
   Many if not all of these behaviors are controlled by specific
genes, chiefly two known as fruitless and dissatisfaction.
Biologists name genes inversely, some would say perversely, by
describing what the organism cannot do after one of its genes has
been rendered defective with a mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Male flies with a mutation in their fruitless gene cannot
perform the courtship song correctly. Their sexual orientation is
deranged and they will court each other rather than females (hence
``fruitless''). Females with a defective dissatisfaction gene
resist copulation. Further details about the fly's sexual hang-ups
and much else besides can be found in flybase, the electronic
encyclopedia of fly lore, at flybase.bio.indiana.edu.
</P>
<P>
   If each step in the fly's courtship is choreographed in its
genes, are the flies just miniature automata with no freedom of
action? And if so much of the fly's behavior is under tight genetic
control, how much of human behavior is also framed by the genes?
</P>
<P>
   The decoding of the fly's genome opens out vast new avenues for
fly people to explore. Only some 2,783 genes are recorded in
flybase, the fruit of 93 years of fly person labor. The genome
sequencers found all but five (and some or all of these five may be
erroneous), and another 10,823 genes besides. The role of about
half of the fly's 13,601 genes can be guessed, because their DNA
sequences resemble those of genes whose purpose is known, but 22
percent of the genes match nothing in the data bases.
</P>
<P>
   Even when roles have been assigned to all of the fly's presently
predicted genes, Drosophilists will still be one major step away
from the total definition of the fly. Imagine having a full list of
parts for a Boeing 747 but not a single instruction for how to
assemble them. Drosophila melanogaster has, perhaps, a fourth great
gift of knowledge still concealed within its frail, miraculous
body.

<P>
   Since Dr. Dian Fossey began studying the mountain gorillas of
Rwanda and adjoining countries in the 1960s, researchers have
tracked, with some interruptions, the fortunes of these engaging
creatures in a perpetually endangered forest.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a collaboration of several American and Rwandan
institutions is taking that program to the edge of high technology,
using remote sensing from satellites and aircraft and electronic
trackers on the ground to create a vastly expanded, instantly
accessible record of the gorillas and their habitat in digital
form.
</P>
<P>
   As powerful as the project's influence on conservation is likely
to be, it could carry an even greater importance for a Rwandan
government that is struggling to recover from years of war and
civil strife. Government ministries, several of which are involved
in the project, hope to use it as a way to train people in the use
of computers and sophisticated communications technology, said
Joseph Mutaboba, Rwanda's representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The same remote sensing technology that will map the vegetation
and terrain of the Virunga conservation area, where the gorillas
live, could eventually be used to follow land-use patterns and
search for natural resources in the entire country as it rebuilds,
Mutaboba said. ``The government of Rwanda's goal was to see how
much that technology can offer us,'' he said. ``And it is a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   For now the project, which has already begun assembling data
taken from satellites and aircraft, is focusing on the Virunga
area. The project is a collaboration between the Dian Fossey
Gorilla Fund International, the National University of Rwanda, the
Georgia Institute of Technology, Clark Atlanta University, Zoo
Atlanta and a number of Rwandan government agencies. Much of the
money for the first two years of the project is from a $300,000
grant from the state-financed Georgia Research Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The project is using satellites and aircraft to carry
instruments that analyze the spectrum of light reflected from soil
and plants. Different plants and soil types reflect distinct
spectrums, allowing scientists to construct point-by-point maps of
the forest and its resources, including the stinging nettles, wild
celery, thistles and bedstraw that mountain gorillas like to eat
most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can show destruction of habitat,'' said Clare Richardson,
the Fossey fund's president. ``It can show pathways through
wilderness areas. It can show campsites if you have poachers. It
can show tilled earth.''
</P>
<P>
   And all of that information can be combined, she said, with the
daily or even hourly coordinates of gorilla groups, as radioed from
the human trackers the Fossey Fund has long supported, and who have
begun carrying Global Positioning System units that communicate
with satellites to determine absolute positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can identify how much gorilla food exists in the park, and
then overlay on top of that what are the home ranges,'' said Netzin
Gerald Steklis, director of the fund's Scientific Information
Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
   From that, she said, researchers hope to determine the region's
``carrying capacity,'' or the greatest number of gorillas it could
support, and figure out why gorillas avoid some areas where food
seems to be plentiful. ``Right now we're kind of looking at a
critical stage in this population,'' Steklis said. ``They're
quickly approaching the carrying capacity of the park.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Virunga area is best known from the
movie ``Gorillas in the Mist,'' which gave a version of Fossey's
life and research. Like Dr. Jane Goodall's work with chimpanzees in
Eastern Africa, Fossey's research was the first to sketch out the
social and ecological subtleties of mountain gorillas in the wild.
Fossey was murdered under mysterious circumstances in Africa in
1985, but scientists and local trackers have continued her work.
</P>
<P>
   The Virungas, dotted with half a dozen volcanoes, spreads over
about 170 square miles in Rwanda, Uganda and Congo (formerly
Zaire). The 320 or so gorillas in the Virungas make up a little
over half the world's population; the rest inhabit a separate
region, the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since Fossey brought them to worldwide attention, the gorillas
in the Virungas have slightly increased in number. But during the
regional war, the area was the highway to Congo, Steklis said,
leading to ecological damage, and perhaps gorilla deaths, that have
yet to be assessed. (Although hundreds of elephants and lowland
gorillas were reportedly killed by poachers during the war, a first
look suggests that the mountain gorillas fared relatively well,
Steklis said.)
</P>
<P>
   This gap in knowledge is the prime motivation for the new
project, said Nickolas Faust, a principal research scientist at
Georgia Tech's Research Institute. ``The project is about trying to
integrate technology into conservation,'' Faust said.
</P>
<P>
   The first tool in that program is the spectral analysis of light
reflected upward from various species of plants. Differences in
molecular and cellular structure and water content lead to
recognizable variations in reflection at different wavelengths, or
colors, of the spectrum, all the way from the infrared band through
the visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plants produce a different color pattern that I can
identify,'' said Dr. Larry Lass, in the department of plant soils
and entomological sciences at the University of Idaho, who is
performing some of the analysis with the help of a grant from the
National Geographic Society.
</P>
<P>
   In August, researchers found just how strikingly detailed the
vegetation maps could be when they flew over about 100 square miles
in the Virungas, including parts of all three of the countries that
contain it, in a small airplane that carried a so-called
hyperspectral instrument provided by Earth Search Sciences Inc. of
McCall, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The data, which Lass and others are still analyzing, contain a
minutely detailed spectrum from each patch of ground, about 15 feet
square. The research team is also using somewhat coarser spectral
images, covering a wider area, from the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Landsat satellites, said Dr. Timothy W.
Foresman, national executive manager for the NASA Digital Earth
Initiative, which is also supporting the project.
</P>
<P>
   All this information will be combined in various ways with radar
images of the Virungas taken by the space shuttle Endeavor several
years ago, digitized topographical maps and other data, said Dr. H.
Dieter Steklis, chief scientist at the Fossey Fund and a professor
of anthropology at Rutgers University. (He is married to Steklis,
the resource center's director.)
</P>
<P>
   Computer workstations and laptops to compile data have been
delivered to the National University of Rwanda in Butare, said Paul
Beaty, a geographer at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The use of that equipment should help in monitoring the gorillas
and their habitat, and perhaps even raise the profile of
conservation efforts that the Rwandan government hopes will start a
trickle of tourists back to the country, said Mutaboba, the
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   But if financing can be found, the eventual aim for the remote
sensing technology is larger, said Dr. Romain Murenzi, chairman of
physics department at Clark Atlanta University and a senior
principal investigator at the Center for Theoretical Studies of
Physical Systems there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be able to have the possibility of a survey
for the whole country,'' said Murenzi, a Rwandan who has applied
for American citizenship. ``So they can see what they've got.''

 &HT;    NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SETS NEW GOALS FOR EXPLORATION
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Summoned by the National Geographic Society from
mountaintops, ocean depths, rain forests and desert digs, assembled
adventurers sounded a common refrain Monday: Discovery on Earth has
barely begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exploration is alive and well. It is not something of another
century,'' declared Robert Ballard, who discovered the sunken
Titanic in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the 21st century is going to be THE great age of
discovery,'' echoed Steven Ambrose, historian and author of a
best-selling book on pathfinders Lewis and Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years of study have only scratched the surface of
discovery about behavior of chimpanzees in Tanzania, said Jane
Goodall, the author and anthropologist.
</P>
<P>
   Founded more than a century ago, the National Geographic Society
gathered what it called a ``Who's Who of exploration'' to initiate
a new mission of not only finding the wonders of the world. but
saving them as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Society will sponsor seven ``explorers in residence'' who
are dedicated to discovery and preservation of Earth's natural and
cultural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, as we explore, the places and treasures we find
are too often threatened with destruction,'' said Society President
John Fahey. ``Today's explorer must also be a conservationist.''
</P>
<P>
   The explorers' introduction at the National Geographic Society
headquarters was not only the first time they had gathered under
one roof, but perhaps the only time that all had simultaneously
been under a roof, period. Their lives have been spent mostly out
of doors _ in the wilds or on ship decks or under water.
</P>
<P>
   The initial ``explorers in residence'' and their missions are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Paul Sereno: A paleontologist, Sereno has discovered new
dinosaur species on several continents. He is beginning a
three-month trek to the Sahara, tracking not only ``one of the most
unusual dinosaurs ever known'' but also the remains of unknown
animals who lived during the dinosaur era.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sylvia Earle: A marine biologist nicknamed ``Her Deepness,''
Earle has led more than 50 expeditions totaling more than 6,000
hour underwater. Her next project is exploring marine sanctuaries
of the Channel Islands, Monterey Bay and the Florida Keys and
studying ``how to live better with the aquatic systems than sustain
us.''

<P>
   _ Wade Davis: An anthropologist and botanical explorer, Davis
has lived with 15 indigenous groups of people in the Amazon and
Andes. Among his seven books is one on folk preparations implicated
in the creation of zombies. His next explorations will be of remote

best known for his 1995 discovery of the ``Inca Ice Maiden,'' a
frozen human sacrifice found on Peru's Mount Ampato. Racing against
looters, he is continuing a search for Inca burial sites in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ballard: His next mission is a expedition to the Black Sea in
search of ancient shipwrecks and evidence of Noah's great biblical
flood.

   The National Geographic Society began supporting exploration in
1890 by backing the expedition of Israel C. Russell, who found
Mount Logan, Canada's highest mountain. The society will support
projects for each of the ``explorers in residence'' for several
years and the explorers will serve as advisors on other Society
projects.

<P>
   At a luncheon, the explorers joked about their new status.

   But they were somber in their warnings about environmental
dangers to wild plants and animals.

   ``Is there hope for the future?'' asked Goodall. ``Yes, but I
don't believe there is a long window.''

 &HT;    Practical man's clunker reaps a heap of grief
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The practical man got run over last
week.
</P>
<P>
   By his buddies.
</P>
<P>
   Striding sturdily toward the production department, his mind on
urgent newspaper business, he decided to take a shortcut through
the cafeteria. There, his industrious colleagues were again
matching their massive wits _ this time over automobiles _ at that
dillydallying debauch they call lunch. They mowed him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen the Practical Man's car?'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bloated boat,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dented dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uglier than a dead fish at a fashion show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tackier than bib overalls at The Breakers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clampetts had a better ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the ambush, bleeding from the barrage, the practical
man stuck out his bottom lip, shouted ``You guys are so mean!'' and
fled sobbing to the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   JUST KIDDING!
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the practical man said, ``It moves. It's mine. I like
it.'' And went back to work.
</P>
<P>
   But it got him thinking. Is there something wrong with his car?
</P>
<P>
   The practical man drives a 1985 Chevy Caprice. It cost him
$2,300 six years ago. It's never failed to start, never left him
stranded and it's required less than $1,000 to maintain since he
bought it. He has no car payment, carries no costly collision
insurance and gets no grief from stupid drivers, who steer clear
for two reasons: He's bigger than they are, and he obviously isn't
afraid to rub fenders to retain his right of way. He likes the car
because it's cheap and it gets him there.
</P>
<P>
   But his pals want more than transportation. They want fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them drive sport utility vehicles. It doesn't matter to
them that SUVs are neither sporty (they're half-truck, half-station
wagon, for God's sake!), nor particularly useful (the Chevy can
carry more people and twice the groceries).
</P>
<P>
   What matters is that SUVs pretend to be what their owners are
not _ fun yet rugged, whimsical yet wise, young yet responsible _
thus concealing what their owners actually are: flabby yet
middle-aged. For the price of 15 Chevys, SUV drivers get a sad
dream and a spare tire bolted to the hatchback that few of them
know how to remove, much less actually use.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the lunch gang apparently figured that at age 40, it
was time they grew up and got practical, because most dropped 30
grand on minivans. These toy boats seem handy _ until your first
visit to Home Depot, when you realize that a kid on a bike can
carry home more lumber. And they seem family friendly _ until your
dog barfs and your toddler slathers sticky goo on seats that cost
you 30K, or until you try to go on vacation and discover you'll
have to put the luggage on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Note to potential minivan buyers: Don't waste thousands playing
at practicality when a few hundred gets you the real thing: A 1973
Dodge Maxivan. The practical man's 15-passenger church bus cost him
$500, can cart your family and his to Disney with room to spare and
swallows 4-by-8 sheets of plywood whole. It also makes a great fort
for the kids between outings.
</P>
<P>
   But the practical man is missing the point. His pals would never
drive an '85 Chevy or a '73 Dodge because cars like those are just
too old and ugly. But who has more style? The drone who drives what
everyone else does, or the practical man, whose wheels are his
alone?
</P>
<P>
   Q&AMP;A FROM READERS
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man,
</P>
<P>
   Due to the hostile nature of your response to my recent
suggestion to include a Practical Woman column, I can only deduce
that you feel threatened by the possibility that there are actually
women who are as practical (if not more so) than men.
</P>
<P>
   I envisioned a utopia of practicality, with both the male and
female pragmatic viewpoints disseminated. Alas, you actually
exhibited the kind of reaction you seem to dislike yourself _
emotional and insecure.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I will still read your column, but I will never have the
same respect for you, Practical Man.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sincerely, Wendi Ladika (a.k.a. I would've made a great
Practical Woman)
</P>
<P>
   A: All right, Wendi. The practical man sugarcoated it last time,
but now he must speak the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Give it up. What could you possibly write about? The practical
way to buy your 25th pair of shoes? How to spot a bargain on the
shopping channel? Ten makeup tips for the practical woman?
</P>
<P>
   The practical man isn't practical because he's a man. He scorns
stupidity of any gender and laughs as loudly at sports fans as he
does at fashion models. Any practical woman, if she were truly
practical, would do the same, write the same column _ and put him
out of a job. So once again: Scram, Wendi!
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man,
</P>
<P>
   While reading your column recently, I almost had to throw up at
your description of how to extract peas from a child's nose.
</P>
<P>
   What struck me was that, the day before, I had just been reading
``Angela's Ashes'' and had come upon the image of the father
sucking stuff from a child's nose. This was something I had never
heard of in all my 71 long years on this earth, and I found the
image totally, totally disgusting. And I was trying to put that
picture away from my mind when I came across your write-up.
</P>
<P>
   Is this thing going to keep haunting me now?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ramona Rougerie, West Palm Beach
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, Ramona, a pea up the nose is nothing. Someday the
practical man will tell the tale of Little Peter's Potty and the
Mystery Marble. That's the image that's still haunting him.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man,
</P>
<P>
   I enjoyed your April 2 column. When one of my daughters stuffed
a cherry pit up her nose, I panicked and called my doctor who told
me to bring her right down. Instead, I poured some black pepper
into my palm and asked her to sniff it. Out popped the pit along
with the sneeze that ensued _ thus saving the doctor's time and my
daughter's discomfort. Pass it along!
</P>

 &HT;    Steiger reflects on long career of triumphs, failures
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 74, Rod Steiger looks back at a long career of more than 100
films and TV movies and sees plenty enough that's good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 60 percent virgin and 40 percent whore,'' he says bluntly.
``I've not sold out that much. I've made my own triumphs, and I've
made my own mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   In movies he's portrayed Rasputin, Pontius Pilate, Rudolph Hess,
Mussolini, Napoleon and Al Capone. He landed his first Oscar
nomination for his second film: 1954's best picture winner, ``On
the Waterfront,'' opposite Marlon Brando. Later came ``The
Pawnbroker,'' the tale of a tormented Auschwitz survivor, and
another Oscar nomination. Then he won best actor as the Mississippi
bigot in the racially ignited ``In the Heat of the Night.'' A few
years later came one of his biggest mistakes. He turned down
``Patton,'' which ultimately went to George C. Scott, and instead
filmed ``Waterloo.''
</P>
<P>
   At 8 tonight, Steiger recaps much of his career in Turner
Classic Movies' ``Private Screenings: Rod Steiger,'' a thoroughly
interesting and often revealing hourlong interview hosted by Robert
Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Screenings,'' Steiger talks openly about his love-hate
relationship with his alcoholic mother, his absent father and key
events that led to some of his greatest movie scenes. For example,
his renowned ``silent scream'' in ``The Pawnbroker'' was inspired
by his recollection of seeing Picasso's ``Guernica'' with its
powerful images of Spanish figures, heads titled back and arms
raised upward, in complete despair.
</P>
<P>
   Steiger came to Atlanta late last year to film ``Screenings''
and visited a few art galleries in Buckhead. Age has made it much
more difficult for him to walk. He covers his enormous frame
head-to-toe in black knit. When he takes off his hat, his bald head
and sagging jowls make him resemble Darth Vader _ minus the mask.
But his voice still booms, his passion for work remains unbridled
(last year, he played supporting roles in ``Crazy in Alabama,''
``End of Days'' and Oscar nominee Denzel Washington's ``The
Hurricane'').
</P>
<P>
   Steiger also sat down at TCM to a hefty lunch of fried chicken,
mashed potatoes and pecan pie and talked about his years as an
actor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a quote recently where you were lamenting that TV
acting was creeping into the movies. What did you mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't the acting. It was the diminishing of the time for
rehearsing. We don't get hardly any time anymore. You know, movies
would be 80 percent better if actors would do more homework. They
don't, especially the ones who think they are gifted. Because many
of them don't come from the theater. So they don't understand that
rehearsing gives you the courage to do more things. When you don't
feel secure, you unconsciously resort to a cliche whether you are a
reporter or a mechanic or anything.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There was a story going around a while back that you and the
writer for ``Crazy in Alabama'' got into a big row. Seems you
weren't speaking the dialogue as written.
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know. I improvise a lot. I think an actor should
change whatever makes him feel comfortable except the thought of a
line. Or the cue. It's like porridge. If it's too hot, maybe you
want to put some more milk in it. Go ahead, I don't care. As long
as the point is ultimately the same. The porridge and the cue are
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read over and over again that you turned down ``Patton''
but have never read why. So why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your strength depends on how you feel, physically and
mentally. I had had all these successes _ the Academy Award or
whatever it was. So my philosophies were stronger. I said I'm not
going to glamorize a guy who had to do with killing and war. I was
a schmuck. It was a very big business, professional mistake. 'Cause
if I had done ``Patton'' half as good as Mr. Scott, I would have
walked into ``The Godfather.'' But I said, ah no, I'm not going to
do this. So we all make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But in turning it down, you played Napoleon in ``Waterloo.''
Wasn't that about war?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's different. That's historical. ``Patton'' showed the
ruthless killing. When you see something that's 100 years ago, it's
more of a story.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which of your films do you think speaks most to the public?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The Pawnbroker'' spoke to a lot of people who were not
Jewish. Of course, one of the essences of the film is loneliness.
And that touches anybody. I think ``The Harder They Fall'' taught a
lot of people who weren't interested in boxing what the boxing
world was like. But that's a peripheral perk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private Screenings: Rod Steiger''
</P>
<P>
   8 tonight on Turner Classic Movies, followed by 1967's ``In the
Heat of the Night'' (9 p.m.), a repeat of ``Screenings'' (11 p.m.),
1959's ``Al Capone'' (midnight) and 1965's ``Doctor Zhivago'' (2
a.m.). Three more films air Friday on Steiger's 75th birthday:
1968's ``No Way to Treat a Lady'' (8 p.m.), 1956's ``The Harder
They Fall'' (10 p.m.) and the 1956 Western ``Jubal'' (midnight).

 &HT;    An accident, a celebrity, a mystery
 &HT;    By Lyle Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Andrew LaRocco and James Ward saw a fellow
motorist emerge from a burning wreck last winter, they rushed to
her aid.
</P>
<P>
   LaRocco says he got her to roll on the ground to extinguish the
flames that had charred her clothes and skin. Joining him moments
later, Ward says he helped move her and stayed by her side as she
softly uttered prayers.
</P>
<P>
   But when the story became national news, neither man got any
credit. It all went instead to pop idol Usher Raymond, the
20-year-old recording artist and movie star who lives in
Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Even though LaRocco and Ward said they never saw Raymond, the
woman's son heard that Raymond had intervened and went on a local
radio station to thank him. Usher accepted his gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the tale of Raymond as a celebrity-hero was born. But
Raymond won't talk about what role he played.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never wanted it publicized in the first place,'' says
Jonetta Patton, the star's mother and manager. ``He did it out of
the goodness of his heart. Usher doesn't want to talk about it
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident took place about 10 p.m. Jan 17. Danielle Marcia
Wright, 47, of Marietta, Ga., was driving east on I-285 in a Ford
Mustang convertible. The Mustang crashed into a retaining wall,
then was hit by another car, and exploded. Wright died Feb. 24 at
Grady Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   LaRocco, Ward and three other eyewitnesses who were contacted by
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said they did not see Raymond. The
officer who took statements at the scene didn't see him either. ``I
remember his face because I met him at a Hawks game last year,''
says DeKalb Officer R.L. Knock. ``My son has one of his albums.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Wright's son, Army Sgt. Norris Sanders, went to Grady
to see his mother, he says nurses told him that Raymond had been
there to visit. He says Raymond also tried to call his family. ``My
grandmother spoke to him, but she didn't know who he was and she
lost the number,'' Sanders says. So Sanders called Ryan Cameron,
morning disc jockey for Hot-97.5 radio, to contact Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron persuaded Raymond to speak with Sanders by telephone on
his March 3 show. It was a brief but heartwarming exchange in which
Sanders expressed his gratitude and Raymond confirmed that he had
helped Wright at the accident scene.
</P>
<P>
   The tape of the conversation cannot be found, Cameron's producer
says now. But Cameron remembers the conversation this way: ``Usher
happened onto the scene after the collision occurred, and he at
least helped put out the fire on Mrs. Wright. He was holding her on
the ground on the scene. Mrs. Wright was praying, saying, 'God is
good.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ward remembers her uttering the same phrase.
</P>
<P>
   After the radio show aired, the story of Raymond's heroism
whipsawed through the music media. MTV.com ran a story on its Web
site, which included an audio clip of his voice from the radio
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just prayed to God and asked that (he) allow me to do the
right thing, because I didn't want to make it worse than it
actually was. I did the best that I could,'' Raymond says on the
clip.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders remains convinced that Raymond helped his mother.
LaRocco and several other witnesses at the scene said they never
saw Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard Usher on the radio, I thought he must have been
talking about another accident,'' says Dani Bethea, 28, of Atlanta,
who also stopped to help and later gave her statement to police.
</P>
<P>
   LaRocco, a 31-year-old Avondale Estates, Ga., resident who owns
an employee benefits company, says he was driving behind Wright's
car and saw the crash. As he stopped to help, LaRocco says, he saw
Wright punch a hole in the burning roof. Enveloped in flames, she
clambered across the trunk and fell to her knees.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, 50, is a paramedic for a private ambulance service who was
returning home after teaching a course in emergency treatment. He
remembers the aftermath of the accident vividly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked her up to move her, but there was nothing to hold
her by because so much of her body was burning,'' says Ward, who
also placed his jacket over her. ``She was saying `God is good. God
is great.'''
</P>
<P>
   LaRocco is adamant that Raymond didn't assist. Ward is nearly as
sure. ``I don't think anyone else put a jacket over her. I guess it
could have happened, but I don't think so.''
</P>

 &HT;    Dressing for success has new meaning for women in business world
today
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Rebekah Lowe remembers one of the
earliest career-building tips she received as a young woman
starting out in business: If you're pregnant, you should never
mention anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the elephant in the living room,'' said
Lowe, East Florida regional executive for Wachovia Bank. ``Heaven
forbid anyone realize I'm female.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, who manages bank operations from Titusville to Miami, says
those views have changed profoundly over the past 10 years as women
have established themselves as competent and confident
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am much more comfortable,'' said Lowe, 41, from her office
in downtown West Palm Beach. ``I have felt the need and desire to
be far more integrated with my personal and work life ... People I
work with know plenty about my husband and my children and my golf
game.''
</P>
<P>
   While pioneering business women often felt compelled to avoid
acknowledging their home lives and to cover up their sexuality,
women in today's work force are freer to express _ and even
celebrate _ their beauty and femininity.
</P>
<P>
   And they are finding it can be good for their careers. After
all, men traditionally have relied on the power of charm and a good
golf game to boost their business image.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get in the door with your looks and prove it with
your brains, more power to you,'' said Michelle Brown, manager of
communications and public relations for Triarc Restaurant Group,
the Fort Lauderdale-based franchiser of Arby's.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 31, is typical of a new generation of women in business
who are unapologetic about using more than confidence and smarts to
get ahead. The shift in attitude is evident in the way women dress
and interact at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Boxy business suits and masculine bow ties have given way to
soft twin sets and colorful pantsuits. And women are comfortable
offering a nurturing ear to a male colleague as well as engaging in
friendly banter, teasing and even flirtation.
</P>
<P>
   `PART OF THE PACKAGE'
</P>
<P>
   ``Society in general is moving off this model of how the
corporate person should look and respond,'' said Rosalind Murray,
executive director of Board Connection, which recruits and trains
people for the boards of nonprofit groups in Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, she said, ``people are no longer trying to keep
those things that make them a woman in a little box that you open
at 5 o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's morning ritual includes makeup, fragrance, jewelry and a
classic, yet always womanly, outfit. ``For me, beauty equates
professionalism,'' said Brown, who lives in Lake Worth. And as the
mother of two young boys, she says talking about her kids at the
office helps her connect with others and build work relationships
with women and men.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, 41, who also serves as president of the Palm Beach
County chapter of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women, a
leadership and advocacy group, said her style of dress has softened
and become more comfortable over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might throw on a silk suit,'' she said. ``I also like to
dress down some days, wear Capri pants and a sweater set. Before, I
would never show any cleavage at all. Now, I might show some _ it's
part of the package.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more of an expression of who I am as opposed to
what people want me to look like as a woman in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that doesn't mean dressing inappropriately. But,
Murray reasons, men are never told, ``make sure you are less
handsome at work.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of self-assuredness comes from knowing and believing
in yourself, a confidence made possible by the women who marched
off to work 30 years ago, said Gayle Landen, a local consultant and
past president of the Executive Women of the Palm Beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this has happened because we have paid our dues,'' said
Landen, president of Landen, Wells &AMP; Associates, a business
consulting firm in Palm Beach Gardens. ``There were many women who
started in the '60s and '70s that wore the corporate uniforms and
got places on the board and mentored to others.''
</P>
<P>
   As a consultant for General Motors Corp. in the early 1980s,
Landen remembers seeing a room of women executives all dressed in
navy blue and black suits. Today, she said, you'll also see pants,
designer suits and bright colors.
</P>
<P>
   Carly Fiorina, who became chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Co.
last year, was pictured on a recent magazine cover wearing a
stylish red pantsuit. The attractive, 45-year-old CEO narrates one
of the company's new TV spots, appearing in tight close-up.
</P>
<P>
   LETTING THEIR HAIR DOWN
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty is an asset in our society, no matter what sex you
are,'' said Murray, of Board Connection. ``To mask it could be
taking away some opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as recently as a few years ago, women, especially
younger ones in positions of power or authority, felt pressure to
conform to the once popular view that when it comes to women,
attractiveness and intelligence don't mix.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Rep. Sharon Merchant (R-North Palm Beach) said she felt
she had to look ``conservative and smart'' when she first ran for
office at age 28. As a result, she wore dark suits and always
pulled back her hair.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 36, Merchant wears ``whatever color I want, and I
don't wear my hair up that much anymore.'' Why? ``I've just gotten
more comfortable with the role I play,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Karen Marcus, who at 32 was the youngest woman ever
elected to the Palm Beach County Commission, said she wore long
skirts and high-neck blouses and put her hair in a matronly bun for
years after she was elected in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, 47, said she consciously downplayed her beauty in the
early years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had people tell me I couldn't run because I'm too
attractive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Marcus, who admits she ``couldn't wait to get out of those
suits,'' feels more comfortable wearing stylish clothes that are
flattering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around long enough _ I've at least proven there is
some substance behind the outside,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Young women moving up in business today, however, feel less
compelled to suppress the very things that make them attractive as
women. Much of that has to do with the success of women like
Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart women now are pretty _ pretty women are smart,'' said
Brown, of Triarc Restaurant Group. ``You have more and more
examples nowadays of attractive, intelligent women.''
</P>
<P>
   Look no further than the pages of Fortune or The Wall Street
Journal for proof of that.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard, there is Jill Barad,
who last month stepped down as CEO of Mattel Inc., and Andrea Jung,
who became Avon Products Inc.'s first woman CEO last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, nearly 12 percent of the 11,681 corporate officers in
America's top 500 companies were women, up from 8.7 percent five
years earlier, according to a study released last year by the
women's research group Catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   `ONE BIG FAMILY'
</P>
<P>
   While women still struggle to balance their family and work
lives, the idea that a woman can be young, attractive, maternal and
at the same time excel at the office is no longer questioned by
many women in their 20s and 30s. Kate Betts, the former fashion
news director at Vogue, last year took the top job at Harper's
Bazaar, the country's oldest fashion magazine. Three days after
accepting the high-profile job, Betts gave birth to her first
child, at 35.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Dunn, the 35-year-old vice president of investor
relations and public relations for Office Depot Inc., had her first
child six months ago. Dunn said she never worries about how
investors or colleagues perceive the way she looks or dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really counts is do you know the numbers,'' she said. ``I
don't think I have to prove myself. I have to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, who handled investor relations for Talbots Inc. before
joining Office Depot nearly two years ago, is the only woman on a
wing of offices that houses the Delray Beach-based company's top
executives, including CEO David Fuente and Chief Financial Officer
Barry Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   At a fairly senior level herself, Dunn feels free to joke with
her male colleagues, as well as to talk with them about family
life. ``They all have kids or grandkids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This freedom, which some have referred to as the feminization of
the workplace, is evident at the West Palm Beach law firm of
Ackerman, Link &AMP; Sartory, where the managing partner, 35-year-old
Wendy Sartory Link, balances practicing law and caring for
17-month-old twins.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that only four of the 20 people on the firm's staff
are men. But, Link said, ``our work culture is that we are one big
family. We work together to get things done. The men share stories
about their families every bit as much as the women do.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm, which specializes in business and securities law, has
received awards for its gender- and family-friendly policies from
the Florida Bar Association, the Economic Council and the Business
Development Board of Palm Beach County. For example, all workers
get paid time off to spend at their children's schools.
</P>
<P>
   Those types of policies are becoming more prevalent as career
women have made child rearing a concern for working parents of both
sexes.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment of women firmly and comfortably in the
workplace has not only meant that women feel free to be themselves,
but also that the skills women bring to the business world are
increasingly valued, said Landen, the business consultant.
</P>
<P>
   `THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING'
</P>
<P>
   ``They build better families and teams,'' Landen said. ``They
listen better and they are not afraid to take risks. They have
fierce advocacy for what they believe in. They take great joy in
watching those behind them grow or their children grow and
flourish. Women have a great sense of celebration and joy _ that
makes it exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning. Women have the right kinds of
skills and they are comfortable with themselves. They are going to
dress and decorate their homes and drive the cars that express
themselves as a whole woman.

   CUBA-ELIAN _ MIAMI _ As the saga of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez
appears to be either winding down or coming to to a head, the
little boy's Miami family is expected to meet with
government-appointed child psychologists about how best to transfer
Elian to his father's custody. The Miami family, their backs
clearly to the wall with Attorney General Janet Reno remaining
steadfast in her insistence that they turn over the boy, are
expected to appeal to Florida state family court for relief from
federal pressure. The Miami exile community, meanwhile, continues
its vigil outside the family's Little Havana home to prevent Elian
being taken by federal immigration officials. Developing.

LISTEN UP, GANG _ GOOD OLD BILL GATES NEEDS OUR HELP 
 
</HEADLINE>
   By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as soon as I finish my coffee this morning, I'm going to
get on the phone and start organizing an effort to form a human
chain around Bill Gates' house.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, I've never much cared for the fellow. But as I
try to make sense of what the devil's been happening to my paltry
401(k) fund lately, I can't help but think we need to keep the
Justice Department's mitts off him right now. He may be a greedy,
scheming monopolist, but by gum, he's our greedy, scheming
monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of people, I grumble at the mere mention of his name
anymore. I can trace my contempt to the maddening evening a few
years ago when I tried to use Microsoft Word to update my resume.
</P>
<P>
   I was so crazed and bug-eyed by the time I finished erasing the
unwelcome indentations and herding paragraphs back where they
belonged, the only person I could have beaten out for a job was
Theodore Kaczynski, and that's only if he grew his beard back.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, to me, symbolizes all that went wrong with
technology after, roughly, the creation of that primitive
electronic game, ``Pong.'' Back then, the ball moved ever-so-slowly
between the paddles, and we could all grasp the point of the
information age.
</P>
<P>
   It's grown dizzyingly fast and complex since then. Most of us
have no choice but to imitate John McEnroe. We scream obscenities
and throw operator's manuals at the line judge _ the unblinking,
poker-faced Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   My dislike for him grew even more intense a couple of years ago
when I read that he makes about $150 a second.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Templeton, the founder of an Internet newspaper called
ClariNet, did the math. In 1998, Billy Boy was worth an estimated
$40 billion, a sum accumulated over the course of 22 years. That
works out to about $500,000 a hour, assuming he put in a yeomanly
14 hours every business day.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Gates rakes in about $150 a second. As Templeton noted, if
Gates walked down the sidewalk and spotted a $500 bill on the
ground, it might not be worth his while to take the four seconds
necessary to bend down and pick it up. Call me jealous, but I just
can't like a guy like that _ unless, of course, I happen to be
walking behind him on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Love him or hate him, though, I think we all need him right now.
</P>
<P>
   About a week ago, a fellow in Amsterdam posted information on
his financial Web site about a stock offering by a California-based
company called F/Rite Air, pronounced ``Fried Air.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, Webmaster Raymond Spanjar told visitors to his
site, had just developed an ``air ionizer'' that produces good
feelings rivaling Prozac. The product is so promising, he said, the
U.S. Air Force is testing it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure. Uh-huh. We ask our fighter pilots to test all of our
pharmaceuticals and mood-altering gizmos. As you've probably
discerned, good old Raymond was staging an April Fool's Day prank.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few folks took him seriously, though. He announced on
his site that he had reserved 1 million shares and would sell them
to investors. According to the Reuters news agency, the offers
poured it. Before Raymond confessed it was a joke, he'd tallied up
15 million guilders, or $6.49 million worth of orders.
</P>
<P>
   The scary thing, Raymond says, is that not a single person asked
for a prospectus for F/Rite Air. In the birthplace of tulipmania,
people were ready to fork over money because, well, any silly idea
could make a person a millionaire nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Amsterdam, of course. Look at the chief executive
officers of our country's biggest companies. In its annual survey
of CEO pay, Bloomberg News reports that compensation packages
jumped 20.9 percent in 1999, thanks largely to dizzying profitable
stock options.
</P>
<P>
   The median CEO received $4.4 million in total pay, and the
average pay _ skewed by the biggest packages _ was a whopping $10.4
million a year. The list of big earners increasingly includes heads
of high-tech companies, some of which are still earning little or
no real profit.
</P>
<P>
   It's all castles in the air, in other words. Fried air, in some
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Right about now, good old cyberbaron Bill Gates looks about as
reliable as a friendly game of Pong. Join hands, won't you, please?

   SEOUL, South Korea _ An unusual catalog of emotions _ shock,
relief, wariness _ were on display Monday as South Koreans learned
that their country's president would go to North Korea in June for
the first-ever summit meeting with his communist counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   One reaction, nearly universal, was shock that a meeting few had
imagined possible had been successfully negotiated in secret. In
almost every case, the surprise was followed with a happy sense of
relief that the Cold War might finally be ending in one of its last
redoubts.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the practical question, asked by almost all: What will
it cost us?
</P>
<P>
   Such a mood-dampening question, on an occasion seemingly fit for
celebration, was an expression of the extraordinary circumstances
of a diplomatic breakthrough whose basis has still not been
publicly explained.
</P>
<P>
   Why, indeed, after years of snubbing South Korea as an
insignificant puppet of the United States, had the North Korean
government chosen the eve of crucial national elections in the
South to offer that country its most precious diplomatic plum?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all waiting for the details of what we must give them
and what we can expect from North Korea,'' said Yeon Ha-cheong, the
dean of the school of marketing, and an expert in relations with
that country at Myongai University, in Seoul. ``North Korea will
certainly demand lots of things.''
</P>
<P>
   After announcing the breakthrough Monday, the South Korean
government compounded the mystery by providing almost no
information about the secret negotiations that had led to the
agreement with the North. The government did say that the task of
fixing an agenda for the talks would be left to diplomats in the
weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That left many South Korean experts on North Korean diplomatic
behavior wondering aloud Monday who was playing whom. To hear them
speak, either the South Korean government was cynically
manipulating the issue of national unification for vote-getting
purposes, or the leadership was being had by a Pyongyang government
that sensed it was desperate for a pre-election breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, the legislative vote here on Thursday will
determine how much power the South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung,
wields for his remaining three years in office.
</P>
<P>
   And in addition to finally rewarding Kim for the steep political
risks he has taken in reaching out to the North, several analysts
here said that Pyongyang likely calculated that the eve of the vote
was the moment to strike a diplomatic deal at the highest price.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of meeting cannot come all of the sudden, out of
nowhere,'' said Cho Dong-ho, head of North Korean economic studies
at the Korea Development Institute, a private nonprofit group. ``No
one knows in detail, but the basic agenda must be a longer-term
framework of political contacts between us, and of course economic
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although North Korea is widely believed to be past the worst of
its catastrophic economic difficulties of the last decade, when
200,000 or more people died of starvation, the country is still
afflicted with debilitating power shortages.
</P>
<P>
   One potential reward that was widely mentioned Monday as a
possible recompense for giving the South Korean president such a
diplomatic vindication on the eve of South Korea's elections was a
reconnection of the power grids between the two countries, enabling
the booming South to furnish desperately needed electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about quid pro quos has only been magnified by North
Korea's recent diplomatic behavior. For years, following the end of
the Cold War and the loss of most of its communist allies, the
country bore the title of the world's most isolated regime.
</P>
<P>
   But North Korea has recently emerged as one of the most
diplomatically active countries, as it has rushed to establish ties
with a wide range of countries. And in most instances, formal ties,
or even serious diplomatic contacts, have come at a steep price
tag.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent reports have circulated in recent weeks that
Pyongyang, since agreeing to resume official talks with Japan, has
sought $5 billion in ``reparations'' from that country for Tokyo's
brutal colonial past in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, too, has often been put in a position where
it has had to commit to helping ease North Korea's economic
catastrophe _ through major food or fuel deliveries _ in exchange
for Pyongyang's cooperation in suspending nuclear weapons
development or in halting the testing of long range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kim's political rivals, feeling threatened by a dramatic
diplomatic turnabout after weeks of campaigning against his
so-called Sunshine Policy _ the program of steady diplomatic and
financial engagement with North Korea that produced the
breakthrough _ by deeming it a fruitless sellout of South Korea,
Monday clung to the line that the coming summit meeting, with its
hidden and presumably high costs, was no victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government must have paid a huge price, or agreed to some
secret conditions to reach this deal, but that side has not been
revealed,'' said Jan Kwang-keun, a spokesman for the Grand National
Party, the main opposition group. ``We want to remind people that
such compensations involve taxpayers' money.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The public's reaction, although largely positive, was often
laden with complex sentiments and anxieties that are the legacy of
the two countries' shared history of wartime violence,
yield-no-quarter ideological jousting and harshly contrasting
economic fates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really think these countries will unify anytime soon?''
asked Han Kyoung-ok, a 51-year-old woman who was preparing to board
a train to Pusan at midday. ``For people of my generation, this is
good news. But younger people have grown soft in this country, and
now I fear that the northerners, who have lived through so much,
will out-compete us.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, this statement reflected the fact that in the span of
her life _ roughly the period since June 1950 when the war that
left the countries divided broke out _ Han has witnessed an
extraordinary turnabout in the fortunes of the both countries.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of their separate histories, the communist
North, although more sparsely peopled, was by far the more
prosperous of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, though, and accelerating more each year, South
Korea has outstripped its neighbor, becoming one of the world's
most energetic and entrepreneurial societies. The Stalinist North,
though still heavily armed, has meanwhile flirted with economic
collapse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like Han, several people here expressed trepidation about the
diplomatic opening with the North and the unpredictability of
renewing high-level contact between countries that share the same
language, history and culture but that have been so divided by
politics and economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't support unification, because things are nice the way
they are now,'' said Hwang Ji-hwa, a 21-year-old woman, who spoke
in downtown Seoul. ``There are just too many differences between
our countries. If we try to unify, things might get out of hand.''

JAPAN RETHINKING PLANS TO OPEN BANKING INDUSTRY TO NON-BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS graf before optional trim to change `admitting' to
`acknowledging')  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Plans to allow non-banks to enter the banking business
here are faltering.
</P>
<P>
   Hideyuki Aizawa, an influential politician who heads the ruling
party's Financial Issues Research Committee, is urging financial
regulators to reconsider plans to issue banking licenses to
companies like Sony Corp. and the retailer Ito-Yokado, saying the
banking laws need to be redrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that the regulators should not consider this
issue too lightly,'' Aizawa said in a telephone interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that laws in the United States prohibit non-financial
companies from operating banks. ``Usually the regulators here
always say, `It's done in the U.S., it's done in the U.S,' but in
this case, it is not done in the U.S.,'' Aizawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been eagerly anticipating the entrance of new
players into the banking business here in hopes that they would
shake up the staid, clubby world of Japanese banking and bring some
competitiveness to the market. Sony intends to build a bank online,
while Ito-Yokadohas been preparing to add a bank to the many other
services its 7-Eleven convenience store affiliate provides.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate is becoming increasingly politicized. Elections
are looming, and the small- and mid-sized regional banks that might
suffer the most from the competition of Internet banking and other
new entrants are among the most loyal supporters of politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Michio Ochi, the former head of the body that is overseeing the
restructuring of the banking industry here, the Financial
Reconstruction Commission, lost his job for essentially
acknowledging this relationship. Ochi had suggested that he would
intervene on behalf of bankers if they thought his inspectors were
too harsh. The opposition seized on Ochi's remarks as proof that
the ruling party favors bankers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The brief scandal over Ochi's slip-up has been widely cited as
contributing to the cause of the stroke that felled former Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi earlier this month. Obuchi is hospitalized
and fighting for his life.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Aizawa has worked to raise legitimate questions about allowing
corporations to run banking businesses, and some analysts agree
that the regulators may need to give the subject greater
consideration. ``The point is that the standards have to be
clear,'' said Setsuko Akiba, a banking analyst at Deutsche
Securities in Tokyo. ``Without standards, it is premature to
discuss whether the entry of new players like Sony and Ito-Yokado
is appropriate or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Aizawa and others question whether it is fair to allow other
companies to enter the banking business while circumscribing the
ability of banks to invest in other businesses. ``If we are to
approve the advance of other businesses into banking, then we have
to allow banks to advance into other businesses,'' Aizawa said.
``Unless we do so, we are not establishing equal footing for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he expressed concerns about the government's
responsibilities if a bank controlled by a corporation should
encounter financial difficulties.``The Japanese government has put
trillions of yen into Japanese banks already to shore them up, so
if similar problems occur in banks set up by businesses outside the
banking field, similar obligations could arise,'' he said. ``So our
position is to require the regulators to be very careful about this
issue.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To some extent, though, the regulators have already sanctified
non-bank ownership of banks. In February, the Financial
Reconstruction Commission gave a consortium led by Softbank Corp.
the exclusive right to negotiate to buy the failed Nippon Credit
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Although some banks are expected to participate in the
consortium, Softbank, one of the world's largest Internet
incubators, and Orix Corp., a leasing company, lead the group and
would hold the biggest stakes in Nippon Credit Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Softbank's credit is rated ``speculative'' by
Moody's Investors Service, while both Sony and Ito-Yokado enjoy
very high credit ratings. Questions have been raised about how
regulators can refuse to grant Sony and Ito-Yokado a banking
license if an existing bank is being sold to Softbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there are a group of companies bidding for Nippon Credit
Bank, so it's a little different,'' Aizawa said, although he noted
that many people were raising that question.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have already tried to block the Softbank bid, citing
as yet unspecified conflicts of interest relating to its adviser,
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. Goldman, Sachs advised the government on its
sale of the Long-Term Credit Bank, another failed bank, to a group
led by Ripplewood Holdings LLC, a Wall Street investment bank, and
politicians have raised questions about whether Goldman's work on
that deal gave it an unfair advantage in helping the Softbank group
prepare its bid for Nippon Credit.

 &HT;    Viewers tuning in to `Later Today'
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sitting in their cozy ``Later Today'' kitchen set,
Jodi Applegate, Florence Henderson and Asha Blake are doing what
they do best: goofing off.
</P>
<P>
   It's 10:05 a.m. The gabby trio just finished taping their
daytime series. Now it's time to tape what is TV's most annoying
tag line _ ``It's like `Today,' only later.''
</P>
<P>
   Applegate is the first to flub her line. She tries again. The
forever bouncy anchor stumbles once more, still unable to say the
name of her show without stammering. The third time, however,
Applegate's delivery is flawless. But now Henderson, looking mighty
elegant with $500,000 worth of Harry Winston diamonds draped around
her neck (it was for an Oscar fashion show segment), hams it up by
pronouncing later ``Laaaaa-tahhhhhhhh.'' Blake, the Halle Berry
clone, is in stitches.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments pass. Now Ma Brady belts out the word later as if
she's performing an aria at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure our slogan is a bit hokey,'' Blake admits later in her
dressing room. ``But it's grown on us. It's fun and the audience
has come to expect us to have fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And more viewers are having fun watching ``Later Today.''
Developed and produced by NBC News, ``Later Today'' was created to
capitalize on ``Today's'' colossal success. Like its mighty cousin,
``Later Today'' is a mixture of hard news, consumer information and
celebrity chit-chat. One moment Applegate is wondering if Leelee
Sobieski's co-star was a good kisser in the film ``Here on Earth,''
the next she's rolling on the floor giving a dog CPR. The show's
primary emphasis, however, is giving viewers news they can use.
There have been segments, for instance, on overcoming shyness, how
to find the right diet and enjoying sex after 45.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reviews, however, weren't kind. TV Guide said ``Later
Today'' was ``especially disappointing.'' The New York Daily News
called it ``as shallow as a birdbath.'' The New York Times
proclaimed the show was ``unoriginal (and) unexciting.'' The
Orlando Sentinel cracked it should be called ``Later Insipidity.''
</P>
<P>
   Applegate, who co-anchored ``Weekend Today'' on NBC as well as
serving as an MSNBC daytime anchor, shrugs off those early reviews.
``The original `Today' show was panned in 1952,'' says the
35-year-old New York University graduate, ``so it doesn't matter at
all. In the long run, what matters is, do the viewers like it?''
</P>
<P>
   And more apparently do. The numbers tell the story: Last
September, ``Later Today'' averaged a 2.1 rating and 2.4 million
viewers. As of the week of March 27, those numbers were up to a 2.3
rating and 2.6 million viewers, representing a 21 percent increase
over ``Leeza,'' the show that aired in the same time slot on NBC
last year. By comparison, ``The View,'' the popular ABC gabfest
``Later Today'' is usually compared to, averages a 2.7 rating and
2.9 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But the road to increased ratings and more viewers has been a
rocky one. Like any new show, ``Later Today'' continues to be a
work in progress. Gone are those insipid true and false questions
the hosts asked the audience about ``Today.'' Also, Applegate,
Henderson and Blake no longer cram 5,000 topics to discuss at the
top of the hour. Celebrity interviews are longer, and so are many
of the show's segments. For example, a recent segment on Mary
Vincent, a woman who was raped and brutalized 20 years ago, ran for
16 minutes _ the length of two segments. ``Early on, we never would
have done that,'' says Michael Bass, ``Later Today's'' executive
producer. ``Before, we were jamming too many things into one show
and we weren't getting enough information across. Now the pacing is
a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass, who is also ``Today's'' senior broadcast producer, points
out that ``Later Today'' is taking more risks. The true and false
bit with the audience may be history, but that hasn't stopped the
show from turning the studio audience into another guest. ``We want
to use the studio audience to our advantage,'' Bass says. ``Instead
of doing a regular fashion show, we did a game show. We had people
from the audience as contestants and they had to decide if
something was purchased at a bargain store like Target or at a
designer place on Fifth Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the problems with a hybrid show like ``Later Today''
is it must marry the delicate mix of hard news and fluff. For
instance, on a recent show, ``Later Today'' rebroadcast Katie
Couric's interview with John and Patsy Ramsey. The mood in the
studio was somber and deadly quiet. A few minutes later, though,
there was the bubbly Henderson, presiding over a wild Oscar fashion
show. ``It's a difficult balance,'' says Blake, 37. ``One moment,
it's hard news, then you're cooking truffles. It's not always
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The on-air chemistry between Applegate, Henderson and Blake
wasn't easy to develop, either. Unlike the women on ``The View,''
the ``Later Today'' conversations and friendly you-go-girl chat
sessions often felt forced and stilted. Even Bass admits the
chemistry ``wasn't so great'' in the beginning. But Blake notes
that was to be expected early on. ``It's like when you meet
somebody for the first time when you're dating,'' says the
Minnesota native and former co-anchor of ABC News' ``World News
Now.'' ``You tell them who you are, and you're listening to who
they are and after a year or two, you hit them on the shoulder and
say, 'What the heck are you wearing?' You feel comfortable around
them. Now I can say, 'Florence, that's a hideous color of
lipstick.'''
</P>
<P>
   Applegate, who amazingly can turn her nose into a blaring
trumpet (she does dead-on Chuck Mangione tunes), readily admits
meeting the former ``Brady Bunch'' star was intimidating. ``Who
among us did not grow up watching `The Brady Bunch'?'' she says.
``That was a little surreal. It was like meeting Mr. Spock or
Captain Kirk.''
</P>
<P>
   And Applegate still can't get over Henderson's girlish figure.
``She has four children, she's been on this earth 30 years longer
than I have and she has the cutest little figure that I never
had,'' she marvels. ``Well, maybe I had it for five minutes when I
was 11.''
</P>
<P>
   Three women. One TV show. Can they all really get along?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever is the opposite of the catty, back fighting
stereotype, that's what we are,'' Applegate says. ``We're pals and
friends and often go out together.''

   1. WHY DO THEY HATE HILLARY SO MUCH?, by Jodie T. Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the outpouring of high-pitched, even hate-filled
books on the subject of Hillary Clinton, the hideous possibility of
her election to be the junior senator from the Empire State is
looming large in many prolific minds. What, exactly are the Hillary
Haters so worried about? What sort of senator would she be that she
evokes such visceral response?
</P>
<P>
   She will, first and foremost, be disciplined and diligent, well
informed and well prepared. She also knows how to talk. Anyone who
has ever heard her will have to agree that she is a most
accomplished public speaker with a sometimes uncanny poise.
</P>
<P>
   Next, she will be willing to compromise -- this may come as a
surprise. But Mrs. Clinton has been trained in compromise ever
since she first arrived in Arkansas and discovered that her
plain-Jane, eyeglassed image didn't play well with the Razorbacks.
So she got blonded and contact-lensed, and now, if there is any
concern about her appearance among her detractors, it's that she's
too photogenic -- at least for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   And she will draw attention -- not just to herself but to the
important business of policymaking. She will be devoted to her job
and to the idea of public service. My goodness. Who could possibly
want an elected representative like that?

   2. THE ORTHODOX JEW AND THE VICE-PRESIDENCY By Judith Shulevitz.
</P>
<P>
   Could an Orthodox Jew serve as president of the United States?
The question isn't strictly Talmudic anymore, since the name of an
Orthodox Jew has cropped up on Democratic vice-presidential
candidate short-lists.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman -- who is clearly a long shot -- is a
Democrat from Connecticut whose presumed appeal for Al Gore lies in
his right-of-center politics, his religious commitment (which makes
him attractive to social conservatives), and his early condemnation
of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky (which would help
Gore distance himself from the president's perceived moral
turpitude).
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman is also what Jews call ``Shomer Shabbas'' -- he
observes the rules that say what a Jew can and can't do between
sunset Friday night and sunset Saturday night. Among the many
things he can't do: drive or be driven, turn lights on or off, talk
on the telephone, operate anything powered by electricity, or
write.
</P>
<P>
   Would his embrace of these religious restrictions disqualify him
from the vice-presidency?

   3. THE COSMO GIRL'S DIRTY LITTLE SECRET ISN'T SEX, by David
Plotz
</P>
<P>
   Four years after Helen Gurley Brown was pushed out as
Cosmopolitan's editor, the superannuated ``girl'' is in the news
again. She is making the media rounds to flog her new memoir, ``I'm
Wild Again.'' Brown appears on its cover in a slinky,
fire-engine-red dress. She reveals that she was briefly a Hollywood
mogul's kept woman in the late '40s. She gloats that she got breast
implants five years ago -- when she was 73. She repeats her
favorite aphorism: ``Sex is one of the three best things we have,
and I don't know the other two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Wild Again,'' in short, would seem to cement Brown's
reputation as a retrograde sex monkey, a Cosmo girl who has
graduated to her twilight years just as daffily sex-crazed and
man-centric as she was a generation (or two, or three) ago.
</P>
<P>
   But on closer inspection, ``I'm Wild Again'' is a strangely
inapt title and a poor description of Brown's life. She's not wild
again (and she may never have been very wild in the first place).
This is the autobiography of a puritan. The Cosmo girl's dirty
little secret isn't sex. It's work.

&HT;     BUSH INVITES GAY REPUBLICANS TO PARLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's first-ever meeting with
gay Republicans may bolster his image as a ``compassionate
conservative'' but the session this Thursday in Austin, Texas, has
irked leaders of a nationwide gay GOP group who weren't invited.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said Monday
the two-term governor looks forward to his invitation-only meeting
with 13 gay Republicans, including rank-and-file members of the Log
Cabin Republicans, a national organization of gay Republicans.
Among those not invited were leaders of the Log Cabin organization,
which endorsed Sen. John McGain, R-Ariz., in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Republicans are important in this election,'' Tucker said.
``We have to unify our party to be successful in November. Part of
unifying is reaching out and being inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   During his hard-fought presidential primary campaign when he was
seeking the support of conservatives, Bush refused to meet with gay
Republicans or representatives of the 11,000-member Log Cabin
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush explained at the time that such a meeting ``creates a huge
political scene'' and that he ``didn't want to create a ruckus.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush announced plans last week to meet with the GOP gays at the
governor's mansion, saying the post-primary season is ``a different
time.''
</P>
<P>
   `It's important for me to unify our party. And I welcome the gay
Americans who support me, some of whom are members of the Log Cabin
Republican club,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gays and lesbians voters made up about 5 percent of the
electorate nationwide in 1996, according to exit polls conducted by
Voters News Service during voting that year.
</P>
<P>
   But the gay community tends to support Democrats for federal
office more often than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in California's March 7 primary _ in which voters
could cast popular votes for candidates in either party _ 2 percent
of voters in the GOP primary and 11 percent of voters in the
Democratic primary told exit poll surveys they were gay.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said that Bush wants to discuss the ``common goal of
ending the Clinton-Gore era'' as well as ``other issues of
importance to the governor and the group.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker added: ``The governor always likes to take the
opportunity to talk about why he's running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said Bush would discuss education, tax cuts, a defense
buildup, and steps to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. She
said she did not know if Bush would discuss proposals for
broadening the federal campaign to combat AIDS or steps to tackle
the discrimination that ranks as a top priority for many gay and
lesbian activists.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential nominees and the Log Cabin Republicans have a
stormy history. Republican nominee Bob Dole, a former Senate
majority leader from Kansas, rejected a campaign donation from Log
Cabin Republicans in 1996 in a bid to cement political support from
voters who might be offended.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's meeting has stirred controversy within the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   David Hanson, a leader of Log Cabin Republicans in California
from San Juan Capistrano, Calif., wrote to Bush last week to
complain that the exclusive meeting with gay Republicans in Austin
was merely ``an effort to end the media story'' rather than an
attempt to ``deal forthrightly'' with the issues that concern gay
civil rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, the
nationwide organization founded in 1978 that raises about $100,000
every two years to help Republican candidates in federal elections,
said he has not been invited to meet with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Tafel's organization ran $20,000 in radio advertisements before
the March 7 Super-Tuesday primaries that offered support for
McCain, Bush's rival.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1,800-word memo to members on the organization's website,
Tafel said Bush's refusal to meet with the national leadership of
the Log Cabin Republicans ``has illuminated many of the flaws in
his campaign which may have an impact on our party's chances in
November.''
</P>
<P>
   Tafel said that Bush ``demands loyalty'' before considering a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Tafel adds: ``Bush, far from being a uniter who is
compassionate, has actually played upon divisions to win the
nomination and now shows little desire to heal them. A candidate
who cannot unite the Republican party won't win this elector.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Schmid, an alternative GOP delegate to the GOP convention
from Washington, D.C., who serves on the board of the Human Rights
Campaign, the largest gay rights advocacy organization in the
nation, said he was meeting with Bush in an effort to ``improve the
understanding of gay people and gay issues within the Republican
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid added that Bush was holding the first meeting in history
between openly gay Republicans and a presumptive GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows that Gov. Bush is trying to unite the party and
broaden the level of support for his candidacy,'' Schmid said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said that he hoped that leaders of the Log Cabin
Republicans eventually ``will be invited to such a meeting in the
future,'' adding that the first session with the presumptive GOP
nominee was being reserved for ``gay Republicans who have worked
with the campaign for the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   Among others who have been invited to take part are:
</P>
<P>
   _ David Greer, chairman of the Pennsylvania Log Cabin
Republicans;
</P>
<P>
   _ Rebecca Maestri, a member of the Northern Virginia chapter of
Log Cabin Republican Club;
</P>
<P>
   _ David Catania, a city council member in Washington, D.C.;
</P>
<P>
   _ Plattsburgh, N.Y., Mayor Jim Stewart;
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Log Cabin Republicans favor ``full equality'' for gays,
including granting the legal protections of marriage to same-sex
couples. Bush has voiced opposition to sanctioning gay marriages.
He has been ambiguous about whether he would appoint openly gay
people to posts in federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the Bush campaign is aware of Tafel's criticism but
added: ``I really won't want to respond to him directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the Bush campaign would await the outcome of
Thursday's meeting to map its next overtures to gay Republicans and
gay Americans for the fall campaign.

 &HT;    Summer school for the 55-and-over set: It's the latest thing
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When you're over 55, you don't want to
spend your summer sitting on the beach drinking Margaritas.
</P>
<P>
   You want to spend it in summer school.
</P>
<P>
   Because this isn't your kid's summer school, with tired teachers
drumming pre-algebra into less-than-receptive brains. Senior summer
school means classrooms on the side of a mountain in Nepal or
studying music in the Opera House in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Elderhostel, Interhostel, Senior Summer School, Explore. These
are some of the organizations that offer ``schools'' for seniors,
where they can study art, political science, health and religion.
Many times, the classroom goes on the road. And at these schools
there's no homework and no tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stop learning at this point in your life, you're dull
and have nothing to look forward to,'' says Florence
Million-Kleeman of West Palm Beach, who as gone on two Senior
Summer School trips and is planning another one this summer.
``Sitting on a beach would be boring, not to mention getting
melanoma. I want to learn and be a part of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior schools say many, if not most, of their students come
from Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest market is South Florida,'' says Brian Bussian,
program director for Senior Summer School. ``We have a lot of
retired professionals who have worked and traveled a lot.'' These
students spend two to 10 weeks studying college level courses _
political science and international relations are popular _
especially designed for them at schools including the University of
Wisconsin, the University of California, San Diego State
University, the University of Judaism in Los Angeles and Marymount
Manhattan College. While the regular students are gone for the
summer, the seniors can take advantage of inexpensive university
dormitory lodging.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old organization, based in Deerfield Beach, has seen
the number of participants double in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Bussian says, is this age group has the money and
they're not interested in traditional tours. ``They want in-depth
study-tours, small classes, field trips and a home-away-from-home
feeling that a university setting offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sociology experts who study buying trends are not surprised by
the interest in adult travel schools. ``When you're in your 20s and
30s, you buy things. In your 40s and 50s, you buy services,'' says
Minneapolis trends consultant Hazel Reinhardt. ``But after 60, you
seek experiences, travel and study.''
</P>
<P>
   True, says Million-Kleemann. ``I don't want more possessions,''
she says. ``At this point in life you have enough. But I want to
enjoy life as much as God will give me.''
</P>
<P>
   She studied literature at San Diego University for a month last
summer and then went to the University of Judaism in Los Angeles
with Senior Summer School. ``It was the most glorious summer I've
ever had. The classes were wonderful. There was lots of discussion,
and not the strain or stress like when you went to school. You're
just there to learn. You go at your own pace.''
</P>
<P>
   She has signed up for two months in San Diego this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Jaffe, a professor at Florida Atlantic University, and
his wife, Mata, a semi-retired college professor of speech
pathology, have taken seven study-trips with Interhostel, a
nonprofit, international educational organization run by the
University of New Hampshire. Among the places they've visited:
Nepal, France, Morocco, Spain, Guatemala, Mexico, Belize and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their trips are extremely educational,'' says Arthur Jaffe.
``They have alliances with local universities that provide
leadership and professors who are specialists in health, economy
and history.''
</P>
<P>
   Classes often go beyond the classroom, he says. ``They give you
a little carrying stool, and you might stop and sit under a tree,
while a local expert explains what we're on our way to see.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to hear about things, and quite another to go to
a place and see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Nepal, they have so little but they share and take care of
one another. It's wonderful, it's not every man for himself. We can
learn from them. And many Americans would think they were
backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee and Janet Arcand of North Palm Beach have spent two
Christmases in Interhostel programs _ one in Prague and the other
in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Prague, we went to concerts, castles, churches and museums,
and had educational lectures at our hotel about the history of the
area,'' says Janet Arcand. ``We experienced a traditional Czech
Christmas dinner, and they brought in a pastry chef and we made
cookies. The women from the church taught us Christmas carols, and
we went to a lace factory and a Christmas ornament factory. We saw
a ballet, `Romeo and Juliet,' and went to Carlsbad Spa.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna, they attended lectures about the history of Christmas
music and went to three operas.
</P>
<P>
   But probably nothing could compare to attending a New Year's Eve
ball at the Vienna City Hall. Lee wore a tuxedo and Janet wore a
black jeweled gown and they waltzed for the first time in decades.

   Periods of rain will develop in the Middle Atlantic and
Northeastern states Tuesday as warm, moist air passes over chilly
air at the surface. Farther north, the air will be cold enough to
cause scattered patches of snow in New England, with accumulations
likely from the northern Hudson Valley to the Green and White
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, showers will develop ahead of a cold front in the
Ohio and Tennessee Valleys. Some of these showers will be
accompanied by brief bursts of heavy rain. Showers and strong
thunderstorms will develop over Texas as the same front moves into
increasingly warmer and more humid air.
</P>
<P>
   A large area of high pressure over the Western states will
provide abundant sunshine and unseasonably mild readings. Warm
conditions will spread to the Pacific Coast as light offshore
breezes keep skies sunny.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: APRIL PAUSE
</P>
<P>
   Many have heard of the January Thaw, a few days of above
seasonal readings in late January that occurs most years in the
Northeast. There is another less known blip in the temperature
record which happens in early April in the East. Long-term
temperature records show a marked leveling of the average
temperature during the first week of this month, a pause in the
progressive rise to springtime readings at many eastern locations.
The current chilly weather only helps reinforce this April pause. &QL;

 &HT;    As deal fails, Charter Behavioral Health Systems seeks new buyer
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The expected buyer of the core business of Charter
Behavioral Health Systems' 37 hospitals has pulled out of the
proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Alpharetta, Ga.-based Charter said Monday that 30 other
organizations are interested in buying the business of some or all
of the company's psychiatric facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Charter, currently under Chapter 11 protection, said bids for
the hospital business are due into the bankruptcy court next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Crescent Operating said a new subsidiary, COPI
Healthcare, does not expect to close on the purchase of the Charter
business assets. In February, Charter said that it had a firm offer
of $24.5 million from the COPI unit to acquire the hospitals'
business, which has undergone a major downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Crescent Operating did not elaborate on its statement. A related
firm, Texas-based Crescent Real Estate Equities, still owns most of
the Charter buildings and properties.
</P>
<P>
   Six Charter hospitals are in metro Atlanta. ``There's quite a
bit of interest in the Atlanta hospitals,'' said Charter
spokeswoman Karen Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``To sell (the Charter system) as a whole would
allow us to continue business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said after the bids arrive, an auction for the hospitals
will take place, and that Charter will recommend the winner to the
bankruptcy judge. Any sale must be approved by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The court will also eventually decide the issue of severance
packages for more than 4,000 employees of 33 hospitals that Charter
recently closed. Those layoffs have prompted former Charter
employees to sue the company, demanding severance pay and
accumulated vacation pay.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Charter's hospitals in Georgia _ in Athens, Macon, and
Augusta _ have closed, leading to 452 layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Charter has about 5,000 employees nationwide, providing services
for 2,000 hospital patients and for thousands receiving outpatient
services.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently has grappled with lower payments from
health insurers and a U.S. Justice Department investigation into
patient care issues. A ``60 Minutes II'' broadcast last year
alleged patient injuries, deaths and other problems at Charter
facilities. Charter denied systemwide problems exist.

   Taking cautious baby steps, a robotic spacecraft is to settle
Tuesday into a closer orbit of an asteroid it has been circling for
almost two months. Guided by gentle shoves from small thruster
rockets, the craft, NEAR Shoemaker, is taking up a circular orbit
62 miles from the center of the asteroid Eros for more detailed
studies.
</P>
<P>
   After spending about 11 days at this altitude, the craft is to
take another downstep on its way to settling in at a height of 31
miles for months of close-up observations of the pitted, tumbling,
rocky mass below.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to give us our first real chance to understand
the structure of an asteroid,'' said Dr. Andrew F. Cheng, the
project scientist with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics
Laboratory in Laurel, Md., which built the craft for NASA and
controls the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there are many different types of asteroids out
there, perhaps dozens of varieties,'' Cheng said. ``If we ever want
to mine one for minerals or deflect one, we have to know the
structure of these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacecraft have gone by about a half-dozen asteroids, and each
appears very different from the others, scientists say. Some are
coal-black and reflect little light, while others appear bright.
And some seem to be solid rock, while others appear to be
conglomerations of smaller structures and dust loosely held
together by gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft, after a
four-year journey from Earth, on Feb. 14 became the first to orbit
an asteroid and settle in for long-term studies. Last month, the
1,700-pound craft was renamed NEAR Shoemaker in honor of the late
Dr. Eugene M. Shoemaker, a pioneer in the study of asteroid and
comet impacts on the planets.
</P>
<P>
   Eros is one of the larger asteroids, measuring about 21 miles
long and 8 miles thick. It is a potato-shaped rock covered with
craters, unexplained long grooves, and a large gouge in the center.
Because of the asteroid's relatively small size, odd shape and the
fact that it rolls end-over-end instead of turning on its long
axis, orbiting the body is tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Eros' gravitational field is so slight that the spacecraft must
keep its speed down to about 3 mph to stay in orbit. Controllers
are taking so long to lower NEAR Shoemaker to its optimum study
altitude because they must first map variations in the asteroid's
density, and resulting gravitational deviations that could affect
the tenuous orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results from NEAR Shoemaker and its six main
instruments indicate that the cratered asteroid, now 130 million
miles from Earth, is strewn with boulders, rocks and a loose layer
of gravity-bound debris called regolith. Energy from three
unexpected solar flares last month bounced off the asteroid and
allowed the spacecraft's X-ray/gamma ray spectrometer to pick up
signs of surface minerals sooner than planned. The readings suggest
a surface that contains magnesium, aluminum, silicon, calcium and
iron, researchers report.
</P>
<P>
   The so-far successful $224 million mission, scheduled to orbit
and study Eros for a year, was the first launched under NASA's new
Discovery Program of streamlined ``faster, better, cheaper''
planetary missions. The concept has come under scrutiny because of
last year's failures of two Mars spacecraft, and recent reports
that criticized the management of those projects.
</P>
<P>
   NEAR Shoemaker marks the beginning of intensified asteroid
studies in coming years as scientists using Earth-based instruments
and spacecraft try to uncover the nature of the tens of thousands
of rocky bodies circling the sun in a belt between Mars and
Jupiter, and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   This heightened interest is both scientific and practical.
Asteroids are believed to be leftover material from the formation
of the solar system more than 4 billion years ago. And scientists
believe that early asteroids colliding with the primal Earth may
have brought with them minerals, water and even the building blocks
of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life on this planet definitely has been shaped by asteroid
impacts,'' said Dr. Clark R. Chapman, an asteroid expert at the
Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., ``and it
conceivably could happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe the bodies in the asteroid belt are the
remnants of material that failed to form into a planet in the early
years of the solar system, perhaps because of the gravitational
influences of giant Jupiter. Colliding asteroids in this region are
believed to be a primary source of meteoroids that constantly
bombard Earth, some of which survive the heat of passing through
the atmosphere to reach the ground as meteorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there are as many types of asteroids as there are
types of meteoroids, and there are dozens of types of meteoroids,''
Cheng said. ``And there are obviously many asteroids we don't get
meteoroids from.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are particularly interested in an estimated 800 or
900 asteroids that are larger than 1 kilometer, or six-tenths of a
mile, in diameter whose orbits cross that of the Earth. These
so-called near-Earth asteroids, which include Eros, pose the most
obvious threat of one day colliding with Earth and causing massive
damage, although scientists say no such collision is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   While asteroid collisions with Earth are no longer as common as
in prehistoric times, scientists estimate that large ones still
occur every few hundred or thousand years. And in that lies a
practical reason for learning more about them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If, without warning, someone suddenly throws something at you,
it is hard to defend yourself if you do not know what it is. Your
reaction _ to duck, catch it or swat it away _ would be very
different depending on whether the object is a small pillow or a
brick.
</P>
<P>
   Since its formation, Earth has had a lot of things thrown its
way and has the bumps and bruises to prove it. And with more hits
inevitably coming, people are starting to think about doing
something about it. But scientists know so little about asteroids
and their makeup that they can only guess at ways to deflect or
destroy one imminently endangering Earth. Despite suggestions in
recent motion pictures that people can shatter or deflect an
approaching asteroid with large nuclear explosions, some scientists
say this proposed solution may not work with many types of
asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   The dark asteroid Mathilde, a 37-mile-long body that the NEAR
spacecraft passed in 1997 on its way to Eros, appears to be a loose
pile of rubble instead of a solid piece of rock. Readings from the
spacecraft, passing 753 miles from Mathilde, suggest the asteroid
has a density only slightly higher than water and surface evidence
of huge collisions that should have shattered a solid object.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidence suggests that Mathilde swallows up impacts, like
shooting a BB into a wad of fluff,'' said Dr. Donald K. Yeomans of
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ``It would
stay together by just absorbing the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its light density, an asteroid the size of Mathilde
would still cause great damage if it struck another body,
scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Asteroids like Mathilde may be dust bins of debris swept up in
the early days of the solar system and held together by the gravity
of their own mass, some researchers say, but there may be other
types of rubble asteroids created by past collisions.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence suggesting that some solid-looking asteroids
may be fractured inside because of collisions with other objects or
undergoing stresses caused by the gravitational tugging of larger
bodies they pass, some scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Erik Asphaug, an astronomer at the University of California
at Santa Cruz, says the internal structure of asteroids may be
determined by their impact histories. In a paper published two
years ago, Asphaug and colleagues reported that computer
simulations suggested that many asteroids were aggregates of debris
from previous collisions. Some may be a few large fragments held
together by self-gravity and covered with debris, while others are
rubble piles of many smaller pieces, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The simulations indicated that a mile-wide solid asteroid could
shatter into several pieces if hit by a house-sized object, but
still hold together. Subsequent hits pulverized parts of the
asteroid, but old rubble absorbed shock waves and minimized damage
to other parts. The researchers said that this type of internal
structure would make it more difficult to divert an asteroid with a
nuclear explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William F. Bottke of Cornell University said that such
fractured asteroids could be further pulled apart by encounters
with planets and other bodies. This could account for evidence on
Earth, Mars and Venus that about 10 percent of large impact craters
show evidence of a small crater nearby that formed at the same
time, he said. These binary craters suggest that some asteroids
have fragments that stay close to the main body when they crash
into a planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that there could be a lot of rubble asteroids
formed in different ways,'' Bottke said, ``and this changes the
whole picture of what it takes to blow up an asteroid.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. H. Jay Melosh, an impact crater expert at the University of
Arizona, said that this showed a need to come up with alternatives
to nuclear bombs for defending Earth from asteroids. ``There isn't
a big enough bomb in any nation's arsenal to deflect a
one-kilometer asteroid,'' he said. ``It would take a
million-megaton bomb, and I don't think anyone wants a gigaton bomb
orbiting the Earth for asteroid defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Melosh suggests exploring other options, and favors positioning
a giant parabolic mirror made of reflective fabric material near
the threatening asteroid. This mirror could concentrate the Sun's
rays to vaporize the surface of the asteroid, generating an
opposite reaction that slowly pushes the space rock off course.
</P>
<P>
   Other suggestions for moving asteroids include attaching large
rocket engines to them; landing cannonlike devices called mass
drivers to scoop up and hurl asteroid material away, creating an
opposite recoil reaction; or attaching a giant solar sail that
would use the pressure of sunlight to move the body slowly. But
Melosh said that these suggestions required attaching things to
tumbling asteroids covered with loose rubble, a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of these technologies will be developed
until we see a definite threat,'' Melosh said, ``and we will need
several years of warning to do it. But everything depends on first
finding out more about asteroids.''

HOW TO BEAT THE HIGH COST OF MAUI
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAANAPALI, Hawaii _ Any way you cut it, Maui is not cheap. Even
after resigning themselves to overpaying for air fare and
accommodations, the budget-minded find that the cost of visiting
(and living in) Maui is high. Food, gas, lodging ... everything
seems to be at least 20 percent more expensive than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways, however, to save money on incidentals such as
food and souvenirs, as well as popular activities such as luaus,
boat trips and snorkeling without cutting corners.
</P>
<P>
   This is where I like to save: I'm a believer in flying on major
airlines and staying at nice hotels when on vacation. My days of
buying student train passes and staying at hostels are part of a
romantic but unmissed past. But just as I try to avoid paying
retail here at home, I seek every opportunity to get value when I
buy goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   My first great discovery was that there are a Big Kmart and
Costco on the island. They're next door to each other in Kahului,
near the airport, which is pretty centrally located for most
visitors. Some may find the presence of chain stores on Maui
horrifying, a symbol of the encroachment of big, soulless
corporations on paradise. I say, bring on the bargains. These
stores are big for a reason: People shop there by the millions.
</P>
<P>
   We soon found that many of the locals share my view. Our guide
on one of the very popular bike-down-the-volcano tours, when asked
what CDs of Hawaiian music he would recommend, suggested several
CDs ... and added that he'd seen them at a very good price at the
local Costco, which has a respectable Hawaiiana section.
</P>
<P>
   You can't find everything at these ``big box'' stores. You're
probably going to have to pay full price for a really nice aloha
shirt from a department store or a specialty shop like Reyn
Spooner. Costco does carry some luxury goods (Coach handbags,
Orrefors crystal) but it has virtually nothing in the way of unique
Hawaiian collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   I actually held off shopping at Kmart and Costco until several
days into our trip, figuring I'd shop at smaller stores, buy what
seemed unique and price-compare more commonplace items. Though
Kmart's souvenir section was not very large, its prices on items
I'd looked at elsewhere were almost all significantly better.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaiian-made body lotions in various floral scents, which I'd
seen elsewhere at $5 apiece, were $3.50 here. A three-pack of
assorted macadamia nuts was about $1.50 better than what I'd paid
at Hilo Hattie, a gigantic souvenir shop (still worth visiting)
with outlets in Maui, several of the other Hawaiian islands ... and
in Orange County, in case you get the urge to pick up floral leis
after you return to Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't been looking for calendars, but when I saw some lovely
ones at Kmart _ featuring gorgeous scenes of Maui and Hawaii _ for
only 89 cents, I snapped up a few for family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a ``sunshine on sale'' package that many hotels
participate in, offering a free, lavish buffet every morning with a
stay of at least five or six nights, our breakfast was covered
every day. Since we ate a large morning meal, we also saved money
on lunch: Several days, we picked up packaged sandwiches for about
$3 at one of the many ABC Stores _ sort of Hawaiian 7-Elevens _
around the island and ate them outdoors, picnic- style.
</P>
<P>
   ABC also has very good prices on souvenirs, from macadamia nuts
to costume jewelry. We bought two small gift-packaged bottles of
Hawaiian floral cologne for my husband's nieces for $2.50 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Another discovery was the plethora of activity discounters. My
naturally skeptical husband was ... well, naturally skeptical of
outfits that offer savings of 20 percent or more on some of Maui's
most popular things to do. We read the fine print in all the ads:
We were handed one promotional magazine full of activity discount
ads as we left the airport, and picked up another along the way.
</P>
<P>
   A representative at the Aloha Desk at our hotel (virtually every
major hotel has one, with staffers who will recommend and book
activities) cautioned that with the discounters we should know
exactly what we're getting. For example, some rock-bottom
advertised prices for luaus don't include food, just the show.
Also, she said, some discounters lure you with low prices but
require you to listen to timeshare pitches. We avoided these.
</P>
<P>
   We settled on a discounter called Coconuts, located next to a
gas station between Kaanapali and Lahaina; we liked their
``two-fer'' deals, which packaged two activities for one price. We
bought a submarine ride which departs from Lahaina and the popular
Marriott luau for $114 (plus tax) per person. This was a savings of
about 20 percent per person. Similar savings were available on
packages that included a mountain bike or snorkeling trip.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more confounding choices was between companies that
specialize in bike-down-the-volcano trips. Since being launched by
a now-defunct company called Cruiser Bob's some years ago, this has
become one of the most talked-about tourist activities on the
island. More than half a dozen firms are now in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Departures are almost all in the morning, with many trips
requiring you to leave your hotel in the middle of the night (2:30
or 3 a.m.). Finding a company that was reasonably priced and would
pick us up at our hotel at a civilized hour (after 7 a.m.) became
our priority in shopping around.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't even consider the lowest-priced companies, which don't
pick you up and don't provide a guided tour (they just rent you the
bike and drive you to the top of the mountain). All the guided-tour
operators tout their superiority in offering safety and comfort to
riders; in reality, we found they all offer about the same
equipment in terms of bikes, helmets and wind gear (it gets mighty
cool on the mountaintop).
</P>
<P>
   We settled on Cruiser Phil's, a smallish company that probably
gets some mileage out of its similarity in name to Cruiser Bob's.
Phil's isn't in business with the discounters, but offers a
competitive everyday price ($89 when we visited), which includes a
morning snack (coffee and muffins) and a sandwich lunch at a cute
restaurant on the way down the hill. We liked the small size of our
group, and our guides; one was a dreadlocked young Hawaiian who
plays in a reggae band, the other, like so many of the people we
encountered, a middle-age California transplant.
</P>
<P>
   We even tried to be value-conscious when splurging a bit. I
wanted an hour massage at the hotel, which normally runs $85. The
second afternoon of our stay, I went out to have a look at the
outdoor tents where they give oceanside massages. Since they were
totally booked that day, they'd left coupons for $8 off an indoor
massage on their clipboards. I took one, and booked a wonderful
massage for the following day.
</P>
<P>
   We also earned hotel bonus points for the money spent on the
massage and a fairly pricey meal at the hotel on our last night,
since I had signed us up for the hotel's rewards program via the
Internet shortly before our trip. There's nothing to lose in
joining such programs _ membership is free _ and if you travel even
two or three times a year, they can earn you free hotel stays or
airline mileage in short order. &QL;

 &HT;    America's mom has found secret to keeping young
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florence Henderson has just finished
taping ``Later Today'' with co-hosts Jodi Appelgate and Asha Blake.
Sitting in NBC's green room, Henderson looks tired. After all,
she's been up since 5 a.m. But that doesn't stop America's mom from
answering questions about her sex life, ``The View'' and her date
with ``Brady Bunch'' son Barry Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You once said on ``Later Today'' that you have more sex than
Jodi and Asha. Do you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of course I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did you say that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because I think it's true. They brought up some question
about sex, and in listening to them, and their lives, and how tired
they are, and what they go through, I figured I've got to be way
ahead of them. And I'm in better shape.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You still look great at 66. But the interesting thing is, you
have this sexy image about you. A comic told a joke at a Friar's
Club roast that you're now the oldest woman he wants to sleep with.
What's up with that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I love it. I think it's wonderful. I think it's because I
feel comfortable with myself. I am fairly attractive. I love
people. I love women. I love men. I think they feel it and I'm not
judgmental about people, their behavior and their sexual
orientation. I just try to see the good in everyone. When you have
that outlook, it frees you to have a sense of humor and make people
laugh about something that might be sexy or a little risque. I've
always done that. It keeps you young.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the deal with you and Barry Williams?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was very innocent and very sweet. It was one date. We went
to Coconut Grove, a famous hotel. There was this great tenor
singing and Barry was becoming very interested in music then. He
went on to have a very good voice. It was very innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What irks you about Jodi and Asha?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sometimes it's hard to get in a word edgewise. And I think
they feel the same way about me. Three women who are very strong
women, we all have opinions, we all like to talk and what we're
learning, like in any relationship, is how to step back and let the
other one come forward. We don't get a lot of time to talk to each
other on camera. We wish we had more time to talk with each other.
We think that helps the show, so people can see our personalities
and get to know us better. Let them learn to love us, or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you guys were ``Charlie's Angels,'' who would be Farrah
Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd think I'd be Farrah (laughs). I'd have to get a wig.
Kate, whom I know, she's more serious. I'd give Kate to Asha. Well,
Asha can do Kate or Jaclyn. Jodi could do Kate Jackson pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If ``Later Today'' got into a fight with ``The View,'' who'd
win?
</P>
<P>
   A: We'd win. We're all in the same age group. Barbara Walters is
a little older than I am, so she'd be easy to knock off. I can
handle Barbara and I'm sure the other two can handle Joy (Behar)
and Meredith Viera. Jodi and Asha are getting in better shape. It's
like ``The Brady Bunch'' could always take ``The Partridge
Family.'' No contest.

<TEXT>

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The disco beat hasn't stopped, it's just
been turned around. DJs from all around the world are remixing
those hits of yesteryear into high-tech _ but equally danceable _

record shop Dancetarium, these five disco classics are the ones DJs
remix the most:

 &HT;    Coaltion urges Coca-Cola chairman to settle suit
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A coalition of advocacy groups met Monday with
Coca-Cola Chairman Doug Daft to urge him to settle the racial
discrimination lawsuit quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Daft told representatives of the Coalition for the People's
Agenda that the company is preparing a response to a detailed
settlement proposal recently submitted by plaintiffs' attorneys,
said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, chairman of the coalition. The
organization is made up of about 15 groups, including the NAACP of
Georgia, Concerned Black Clergy, the Georgia Association of Black
Elected Officials and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply urged them to get this crisis behind them,'' Lowery
said. ``We urged them to be fair and just with the employees.'' In
addition to Daft, Lowery's group met with Executive Vice President
Carl Ware, who co-chairs the company's Diversity Advisory Council,
and Vice President Ingrid Saunders Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Lowery said he could not predict whether a settlement could be
reached by Saturday, when a bus ``ride for justice'' is scheduled
to leave Atlanta for the annual shareholders meeting in Delaware on
April 19. The planned three-bus convoy, which is scheduled to hold
rallies in three cities before reaching the Wilmington shareholders
meeting, is being organized to pressure the company into settling
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who also met with Daft recently to urge
a settlement, is planning to attend the shareholders meeting, said
Janice Mathis, chief of staff and general counsel for Jackson's
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. ``The only thing that could stop his
attending could be if they reached a settlement,'' Mathis said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal suit, filed by eight current and former employees,
alleges that Coca-Cola has discriminated against African-Americans
in pay, promotions and performance evaluations. The plaintiffs are
seeking class-action status so they can represent about 2,000
current and former black employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the allegations and opposed the
plaintiffs' efforts to make it a class-action case.
</P>
<P>
   Lowery also said his group urged Daft to do a better job of
diversifying the company's board of directors, which includes only
one African-American _ Donald McHenry, former U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He agreed that they ought to address diversity at every level
in Coke, including the board level,'' Lowery said of Daft's
response.

   PERU-ELECT (Lima, Peru) _ As the government vote count suggested
that President Alberto Fujimori is close to winning an outright
re-election victory in Sunday's balloting, international election
observers expressed grave concerns Monday over the way the
government handled ballot boxes and vote tally sheets as well as in
the slowness of the official vote tally. Crying that fraud was
already being committed, Fujimori's main opponent, Alejandro
Toledo, led tens of thousands of people late Sunday night in a
march on the presidential palace demanding that the will of the
people be respected. The crowd was dispersed in the predawn hours
today by policemen firing tear gas, but opposition leaders said a
denial of a second round would bring a mass civil disobedience
campaign that would make the country ungovernable. By Clifford
Krauss.

<P>
   RAMPAGE-KILLERS-III (Salt Lake City) _ With the voices inside
her head ordering her to kill, Lisa Duy walked into Doug's Shoot'n
Sports here to buy a semiautomatic pistol. The manager, Dave
Larsen, ran a background check on her and the agency quickly
approved the sale, having found no record of felony convictions or
mental illness. The only thing unusual, Larsen thought, was that as
she left the store, Duy was wearing the shooting-range ear
protectors he had lent her. Less than two hours later, on Jan. 14,
1999, Duy, ear protectors still in place, walked into the studios
of television station KSL and began firing her new weapon. She shot
more than four dozen times in all, killing a young mother and
wounding the building manager. What the background check had been
unable to detect was that Duy had a long history of psychiatric
problems. Of the 100 episodes of rampage killings examined for this
series by The New York Times, none better illustrates than the case
of Lisa Duy just how difficult it can be to enforce a key provision
of the nation's fundamental gun control law. That provision
prohibits people who have been involuntarily committed to mental
institutions from buying a handgun. But laws in most states guard
the privacy of the mentally ill, so gun background checks typically
fail to turn up mental health histories. By Fox Butterfield.

   TEXAS-BUSH-HEALTH (Undated) _ Public health in Texas is a
measure of George W. Bush's governance. A state with the per capita
income of Oregon (near the middle) has about the same per capita
spending on public health as Mississippi (near the bottom).
Millions are uninsured, including hundreds of thousands of
children, and large percentages of the poor, but Bush and his
officials worked against adding them to the insurance rolls, even
though the federal government offered to pay most of the cost. Bush
paid very little attention to public health issues as governor, and
his top appointed health official is not seen as a strong advocate.

   MARINE-PLANE-CRASH (Washington) _ The V-22 Osprey, a hybrid

kept it alive. Now three of the 15 finished military aircraft have

remaining planes. The aircraft remains expensive, experimental and
exemplary of the way weapons are built for today's U.S. military.

   NY-LOBBY (Albany, N.Y.) _ In flush times, the Legislature has
become a leaner place and partisan politics is only partly to
blame. Stung by embarrassing revelations that Philip Morris treated
scores of lawmakers last year, and then underreported the expense,
the Republican-controlled Senate adopted a voluntary ban on free
meals with lobbyists and gifts over $25. The Democratic-led
Assembly refused to go along, although 10 of its members have
individually pledged to abide by the ban. Now the shrinking
waistlines are just one indication that a deeply entrenched
lobbying culture has begun to change. By Winnie Hu. (1200 words)

SNORKELING _ A SENSORY EXPERIENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By ERIC NOLAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAANAPALI, Hawaii _ ``Hey, there's a sea turtle out here!''
</P>
<P>
   The boyish squeal drifted up from the waters near Black Rock,
off the west coast of Maui. It found its way over the balconies of
the Sheraton Hotel rooms that cling to the rock face, and probably
awakened a few guests trying to sleep in.
</P>
<P>
   Here it was barely past dawn, the sun just now peeking over the
summit of nearby Puu Kukui, and already the cove was astir with
youngsters, paddling along in their swim fins, puffing through
snorkels, peering down into the water through their plastic masks.
</P>
<P>
   You could hardly begrudge them their enthusiasm, though. There
are rich coral beds off this coast, which form habitat for tropical
fish in many strange shapes and brilliant colors. And surveying
them is as simple as plunging into the clear, warm, often-shallow
waters and swimming along the surface of their exotic world.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to behold. The Moorish idol is striped in black,
gold and white, and has a long sash that trails behind its dorsal
fin. The yellow trumpetfish looks like a survivor from a
prehistoric age _ a tubelike fish with eyes positioned well back
from the tip of its flat snout. The saddleback wrasse features many
of the hues from Hawaii's trademark rainbows, including a
translucent blue and a shocking pink.
</P>
<P>
   A snorkel excursion can produce exhilarating surprises, too. On
a February visit to secluded Honolua Bay on Maui's northwest
corner, I was perhaps 150 yards offshore with some other snorkelers
when a pod of spinner dolphins entered the bay and made right for
us. For several minutes, it was all fins and snouts as they
splashed along, some of them leaping out of the water to execute
their corkscrew maneuvers. Then suddenly we couldn't see them.
</P>
<P>
   Another swimmer cried out, and we looked down into the water.
The dolphins _ perhaps 40 or 50 in number _ had submerged and were
passing beneath us, next to us. They swam languidly by, in many
cases passing within 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   One of the noteworthy aspects of snorkeling is its broad appeal.
It's not unusual to see very young children in the water swimming
alongside seniors. Overweight people don't seem to have any trouble
with this endeavor. Furthermore, the gear is not cumbersome or
complicated and is available for rental at numerous outlets around
the islands.
</P>
<P>
   There are also aids for those who aren't strong swimmers or
aren't comfortable with the idea of sticking their faces in the
water and drawing precious air through a narrow plastic tube.
Boogie-board-like floats are available, some of which are equipped
with a plastic porthole in the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Maui's west coast has several excellent snorkeling spots _ which
is fortuitous, because that's where most of the island's tourist
accommodations are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   Some words of caution, though: Always swim with a partner. Be
advised that the southwest shore can get rough in summer, the
northwest shore can be treacherous when the wind is up in winter. A
good rule of thumb is to limit your activity to calm days and stay
in sheltered water. And children _ no matter how well they swim in
your pool at home _ should be watched constantly.

THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Sidebar to snorkling story.) 
 
 
 
 
By ERIC NOLAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grab the snorkel gear, head for the water.
</P>
<P>
   Maui visitors who are inclined to explore nature's aquarium
should consider these sites on the island's west side. They
constitute the region's magnificent seven.
</P>
<P>
   l. Honolua Bay
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of this derives from its massive size and its
designation as a marine sanctuary. There is a stunning variety of
underwater life (I encountered a sea turtle here a few years back),
with coral beds along each edge of the bay. And if you're lucky,
you just might get a chance to swim with dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Positives: In the summer months, Honolua is as tranquil as a
bathtub, and inviting for all levels of swimmers. Snorkel excursion
boats commonly sail up from Lahaina to moor here, so if you drive
up, you'll save a lot of money _ and be able to stay as long as you
wish.
</P>
<P>
   Negatives: The beach is a jumble of smooth boulders, with only
small patches of sand, so it's not particularly friendly for
picnicking or sunbathing. The rocks also make it tricky getting
into the water (although a wrecked boat dock eases entry for some).
There are no facilities. Nor is there a parking lot. Or a highway
sign identifying this bay. Foot access is via rocky dirt road.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Drive north on the Honoapiilani Highway (Route
30) past Kapalua. After passing J.T. Fleming Beach Park, the road
winds along cliffs. The bay is located at a sharp curve to the left
immediately after you begin to descend from the bluffs. Park along
the road, then walk to the beach along a dirt road through lush
jungle. Don't fret over the ``Private Property, Keep Out'' sign _
it pertains to the adjoining land, not the access road itself.
</P>
<P>
   2. Molokini
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the most popular tourist excursions for Maui
visitors, for good reason. From shore you can see this
crescent-shaped sliver of an island that lies between Maui and
Kahoolawe, and it seems to beckon you.
</P>
<P>
   That island is the very tip of a volcanic cone, and the waters
within the crater are 30 feet deep and rich with coral and tropical
fish. (Just around the edge of the island, by contrast, it's 350
feet deep with a freight-train current.)
</P>
<P>
   Here I encountered a snowflake moray eel _ out of its rocky
burrow and swimming across the bottom like a water-borne sidewinder
rattler _ as well as the threadfin butterfly fish with its exotic
striping and colors.
</P>
<P>
   If you pick the right tour company, half the fun of Molokini is
getting there and back. Our choice was Paragon, which employs a
47-foot, 38-passenger catamaran and spends a lot of time under
sail. On the return trip, as we picked up the winds that rip across
Maui's isthmus, captain Greg Thomas got us up to an exhilarating 17
knots. Spray was periodically splashing over the bow as we left two
other Molokini tour boats in our wake.
</P>
<P>
   Positives: The water is much clearer in the crater than it is
back on shore, making the underwater viewing spectacular. The boats
provide gear, and it might be comforting knowing that a guide on
the boat is keeping watch over you. After your exertions, you'll
find sandwiches and iced beer and soft drinks on most boats. If you
undertake only one snorkel outing during your visit, it's hard to
beat this.
</P>
<P>
   Negatives: This excursion is so popular that the tour boats line
up in the crater like station wagons at a drive-in theater. It's
not a particularly intimate interaction with nature.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Plan to set an alarm. To avoid the afternoon
winds, all boats head for Molokini around 7 a.m. from Maalaea
Harbor (south of Lahaina, at the isthmus). Cost can run from $50 to
$70. Paragon information and reservations: (800) 441-2087 or (808)
244-2087.
</P>
<P>
   3. Black Rock
</P>
<P>
   The cliff extends out into the water at the midpoint of popular
Kaanapali Beach, and the mature coral that clings to its base teems
with a wide variety of tropical creatures. The sea turtles that
frequent this neighborhood have become so accustomed to seeing
humans that the Sheraton's dive shop staffers refer to them as
pets. We saw an entire school of yellowstriped goatfish, which have
two thin, tentacle-like fins that protrude from their jaw. The fish
swim along the bottom and use these appendages to root morsels out
of the sandy bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Positives: This spot is extremely convenient to people staying
in one of the Kaanapali resorts. Soft, sandy beach makes it easy to
get in, and gentle water ensures pleasant swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Negatives: Because of its proximity to the major resorts, there
is often a bit of a crowd in the water. Also, be wary of the
daredevils who jump off the cliff overhead. Unless you're staying
here, parking can be a bear.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: From the main highway, turn left at the sign for
the Kaanapali resort area. Black Rock is at the north end of this
region, at the back of the Sheraton hotel. There are a few
beach-access parking spaces located between the Kaanapali Beach
Hotel and the Sheraton; if they're full, you can park in the
Sheraton's multilevel garage at posted rates. Sheraton Maui
information and reservations: (808) 661-0031.
</P>
<P>
   4. Ulua Beach
</P>
<P>
   This is easily the best snorkel spot in the Wailea area, along
Maui's southwest coast. A jumble of rocks forms a point between the
Renaissance hotel and the Wailea Elua condo complex, and the marine
life seems to favor the high-rent locale.
</P>
<P>
   Here I encountered a 2-foot-long, white-spotted pufferfish with
a bulbous, misshapen head that recalled John Hurt in ``The Elephant
Man.'' There were other bizarre creatures, including a unicornfish,
which swims around with a blunt rod protruding from its forehead,
and a school of goatfish perhaps 200 strong.
</P>
<P>
   This spot is popular for scuba instruction, and it's clear these
people want to get maximum use out of that expensive gear they just
bought. It's not unusual to see them don head-to-toe wetsuits,
including booties and even cowls _ then wade out into 10 feet of
80-degree water and dive next to an 8-year-old kid with trunks,
snorkel, mask and no fins.
</P>
<P>
   Positives: Ah, a rarity for some of Hawaii's finer beaches _
facilities. In developing this area, the resorts put in a 38-space
parking lot, rest rooms, shower and foot-washer. There is an
excellent beach here. Don't feel you need to crowd into the sand
that fronts the public-access area. All of Hawaii's beaches are
public; go ahead and get comfortable in front of the condo complex.
There is also a shady knoll to offer relief from the blazing
west-Maui sun.
</P>
<P>
   Negatives: The coral is within a few inches of the water surface
in some places, so if you're not paying attention, an ocean surge
can threaten to beach you on an altogether unfriendly surface.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Drive south on the Piilani Highway from Kihei
until it terminates at the Wailea resort area and turn right to the
coast. Turn right again onto Wailea Alanui, then turn left when you
see the sign for Mokapu Beach/Ulua Beach between the Renaissance
and the Wailea Elua Village.
</P>
<P>
   5. Ahihi Bay/La Perouse Bay
</P>
<P>
   This is the most remote snorkeling spot of the lot. It can be
found where the road turns to dirt and gravel at Maui's extreme
southwest corner. The black-lava coves here were formed by
Haleakala's last-gasp eruption around 1790.
</P>
<P>
   Positives: Most tourists are scared off when the road starts to
give out, so you'll find blessed relief from the crowds of Ulua and
Black Rock. The views of Molokini and Kahoolawe are sensational.
</P>
<P>
   Negatives: That solitude has its down side. When you're the only
two snorkelers in a vast cove, it can be a little spooky.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Follow the only road south of Wailea and Makena
until the asphalt gives out. Ahihi Bay is just past a sign
identifying the Natural Area Reserve. To reach La Perouse Bay,
continue south past a lottery-dream estate to a rough parking area
on the right. A trail from the parking area curls left to the
black-lava crescent.
</P>
<P>
   6. Olowalu Beach
</P>
<P>
   Rough water can be intimidating to novice snorkelers. Here's the
solution: a swimming-pool-like stretch of coast between Lahaina and
the isthmus. It's also known as Mile Marker 14 Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Positives:The water is shallow, and thus warm. You'll likely see
golden coral, unicornfish and urchins hiding in crevices.
</P>
<P>
   Negatives: The beach is smack along the highway, so you're
subjected to the constant roar and rattle of big trucks. There are
portable toilets. The parking area is trashy. Snorkeling is best
done in an idyll; this isn't it.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: From Lahaina, drive south on the main highway
(with the trucks) and watch for the mile-marker signs. Marker 14
and the beach are just past a ``Pass With Care'' sign on the right.
Northbound from Kihei, turn left into the parking area when you see
the emergency call box just past mile-marker 14.
</P>
<P>
   7. Napili Bay
</P>
<P>
   This is a delightful little cove in Maui's low-rent tourist
district just north of Kaanapali. The beach slopes steeply into the
water, and there's a chunk of reef perhaps 100 feet offshore,
square in the middle of the bay. Numerous tropical fish call it
home.
</P>
<P>
   Positives: The beach is lovely, even though the motels are built
a bit too close to the shore for comfort. The water is particularly
calm in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Negatives: Parking is sorely limited. The beach, though
picturesque, is a narrow strip, so there isn't much room to spread
out for a picnic or a post-swim snooze.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Head north of Kaanapali on the main highway and
turn left when you see the signs for Napili (the road is called
Napilihau, but that's irrelevant because it's unmarked). Turn right
at Lower Honoapiilani Road (stop sign) and proceed to Napili Place.
Turn left there, make a U-turn when it's convenient, and park in
the dirt off the right shoulder. Follow the blue and white
``Shoreline Access'' sign to a beach path that cuts between two
motels.

&HT;     STRIPED BASS MAY SOON HAVE NEW LIFELINE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Imagine catching two striped bass at once,
including one that wasn't even hooked?
</P>
<P>
   A miracle? Well, maybe there is still time for miracles for the
striped bass in the San Francisco Bay and Delta.
</P>
<P>
   You see, on a recent trip to the Delta, we really did catch a
striped bass without using even a hook (and we'll get to that).
</P>
<P>
   At the same time came news of another revelation: According to a
well-connected insider, government approval is imminent for a
program to salvage 1.27 million yearling stripers at the Delta
pumps. The baby bass will be transferred to submerged net-pens,
then fed and grown out to yearling size, and released when they are
strong enough to swim away from the suction flow of the pumps.
</P>
<P>
   This is the bombshell that could once again make the Bay-Delta's
striped bass one of the most wide-ranging and productive fisheries
in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Since the California Aqueduct pumps started cranking in 1968,
the striped bass and many other fisheries have gone literally right
down the drain. The pumps take 80,000 gallons of water per second,
and with it go the baby bass, along with salmon, catfish and other
fish, all sent to points south.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe miracles can still happen. In the past few springs,
the Delta pumps have been shut down for several weeks to keep them
from eating endangered salmon and smelt. A side benefit has been
for the striped bass, often kept out of the pumps as well. They
have had improved spawns also boosted by high freshwater flows from
Delta to Bay from seven straight wet years in Northern California.
That is another reason why the striper fishery is on a big rebound.
</P>
<P>
   It is also what inspired this recent trip. I booked a day with
the best striper boat in the land, Fishin' Fool IV, and its
captain, Barry Canevaro, joined by Sacramento radio star Bob Simms,
best-selling novelist John Lescroart, and Borders' book honcho Tom
Hedtke. We left just after dawn from Pittsburg Marina, then toured
all the old favorite spots, Middlegrounds, the Mothball Fleet,
Grizzly Bay, then cruised up the Sacramento River, finding clear,
green water at the spot called the ``Power Lines,'' located
downstream of Rio Vista.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Delta is just loaded with stripers,'' Canevaro said.
``When they head down to the Bay for summer, people aren't going to
believe how many fish there are. In May, I'm going to follow them
right down and move my boat to Richmond.''
</P>
<P>
   We anchored, used ghost shrimp for bait, and after casting out,
immediately began getting nibbles. At times, three rods were
twitching at once, driving us crazy as we tried to hook the bass.
Plenty of times we did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Lescroart caught the first one, a 7-pounder, providing a great
tussle for its size, then in turn, Hedtke hooked up with a near
identical fish, which took off on power dives to the Delta bottom.
This is called ``getting your chain pulled.''
</P>
<P>
   But what pulled my chain was all the ``Delta trout,'' as I call
them, the obvious zillions of healthy baby bass. You could take a
spinning rod with a Kastmaster and catch and release dozens of them
(the best spot is warm-water outfall at the Antioch Power Plant).
These are the future of a fishery that is coming back after being
nearly lost by the rapacious water pumping to benefit Southern
California during the drought in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that all these baby bass are just the start of what
could turn into the biggest fish success story in America.
</P>
<P>
   For years, fishermen have been trying to figure out how to keep
the millions of baby stripers out of the Delta pumps and California
Aqueduct. That is how the salvage program was invented, being run
as a pilot with about 100,000 fish a year. But to expand it, the
Department of Fish and Game is required to obtain what is called a
Section 10 Permit from the National Marine Fisheries Service. It's
been four years now, and still no permit.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes word that approval for this permit is finally at
hand, though no confirmation of that was provided by any agency,
state or federal. The DFG said only that if the permit is approved,
then a press release will be issued. But it is known that the
funding is in place, with money for the program available from
funds raised from the $3.70 Striped Bass Stamp reauthorized in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have given up on the striped bass, this may sound
like a miracle. But this restoration plan is based on simple common
sense.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to a miracle, well, you have to go fishing to
experience one of those. We caught a half-dozen stripers and a
sturgeon on a beautiful blue-sky day where anything seemed
possible. And so it was:
</P>
<P>
   At the end of one battle, Lescroart leaned back with the rod,
persuading a striper to the boat. Just as Canevaro netted the fish,
another striped bass, about a 4-pounder, suddenly appeared and swam
right into the net. Just like that, the net was lifted out of the
water with two fish in it. There it was, a fish caught without
being hooked.
</P>
<P>
   We let the fish go, watching it dance off. Perhaps it was
celebrating, just like we were.

 &HT;    Disco will survive
 &HT;    By Chris Hutchins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The moment is frozen in time _ a roar
from the past ringing powerfully in the present.
</P>
<P>
   Loleatta Holloway is wailing, her high note vibrating through
the ballroom of the Marina Marriott in Fort Lauderdale. Feeling the
note surge through their souls, the crowd of 300 claps, stomps and
dances at the climax of ``Good Vibrations,'' a hip-hop song
released a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at the World Disco Classic 2000 last Saturday have
come to see Holloway. And to dance. To dance like it was yesterday
_ and like there's no tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The late-night performance is just part of this year's Classic,
which was held last weekend (from Thursday to Sunday). The event,
hosted by a group of Florida producers who are disco fans, pays
homage to the '70s dance scene. There have been countless
conversations about dancing tonight. There have been dance
competitions. And times where anyone can come out to the dance
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The dance? It's that quintessential 1970s groove, the Hustle.
And aside from a few swing dancers, it's what everyone is dancing
tonight: A saucy fusion of mambo and salsa, born in the Latino
communities of New York City. It started as a street dance created
by club-hoppers back then. It's a sexy dance, a hunt of sorts. He
leads, she follows. She falls away, he tugs her back. A slippery
dance, a give and take.
</P>
<P>
   There are no formalities and no rules, save one: Keep the
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   That rule is safe tonight. The dancers _ some who have come from
as far away as Canada _ are veterans. Most came of age in the '70s.
They remember the flamboyant clothes, the great times, the
emotional electricity when they Hustled. They were 18 then.
</P>
<P>
   They're in their 40s now. Real-life responsibility kicked in
long ago. Spouse. Kids. Home. The sideburns are gone, the
bell-bottoms traded in for khakis. But that primal power is still
in the dance. And that camaraderie is still here, on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to stay together with this,'' explains
Lighthouse Point resident Robert J. Jacobs. ``Let's face it:
Disco's been out for a long time. I remember when disco was
officially proclaimed `dead' on `Saturday Night Live.' I was bummed
after that. But the dance is still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   It is. According to Drew Axelrod, one of the event's organizers,
more than 600 people attended the Disco Classic during the weekend.
And disco music lives on in the techno remixes of old hits, the
lyric and music samples mixed into what DJs are calling ``Disco
House.''
</P>
<P>
   The behavior of Hustlers has evolved, too. There are few
``divas'' here tonight. Most are dressed in fun, but sensible,
clothes. The dance floor is wooden, not underlit by flashing red,
yellow, blue lights. The first Bee Gees song doesn't come until
9:55, and it's a remix. In fact, the only thing that screams
``discotheque'' is the small, shimmering mirrorball hanging above
the DJ booth.
</P>
<P>
   But the look doesn't matter. It's the music that counts. There's
something about it _ something about the rhythm, the groove, the
dance steps _ that keeps the faithful coming back. People here tell
you: If you don't dance, you won't get it. They talk about Hustle
running ``through your soul,'' about disco being ``a part of
something inside you.'' They use words like ``kinetic'' and
``dreamy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our passion,'' explains Trish Hansberry, who flew in from
Lancaster, Pa., just to dance here. ``It's the thing that gets us
excited, gets the adrenaline pumping. We love to learn. We love to
watch. We just want to get better and better, and that's why we do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Disco isn't dead. The Hustle made a comeback in the early 1990s,
turning on a whole new generation of young people, and bringing
back many of their parents. There are folks here like Brian and
Silvana Gallagher, who won this year's prestigious ``King and Queen
of Hustle'' title. They saw the resurgence as a second chance, and
re-learned the moves. Others, like 56-year-old Bud Rowe, grabbed it
for the first time, and didn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my 50th birthday, I learned that I had a spot on my lung,''
the Harrisburg, Pa., resident says. ``I had to wait a week for a
CAT scan. During that week, I promised myself I'd do whatever my
dream in life was. That was to really learn to dance. That was 6
1/2 years ago. Haven't stopped since.''
</P>
<P>
   And the spot?
</P>
<P>
   ``Turned out to be calcium, nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are the people who've been with disco and the Hustle
from the beginning. Vince Montana Jr., regarded in this community
as the father of disco's orchestral sound, is here tonight. Those
sweeping violins, the sassy brass, the Latin percussion _ it was
all a part of SalSoul, the orchestra he launched in the mid-'70s.
</P>
<P>
   Disco Classic organizers gave him a lifetime achievement award
tonight. He cried as he gave his acceptance speech. He played a few
familiar tunes, like ``Tangerine,'' on a xylophone. Dancers crept
to the floor, timidly at first, and Hustled to his performance. He
was shaking hands and signing autographs the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is inspiring music. It's happy music. It's good for the
soul,'' Montana says. ``You take this other stuff on the radio,
it's distortion. This is happy. People will always go to happiness
before they go to pain. Basically, it's a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. As Holloway hits her high note late in the evening, no
other words can describe the feeling. Hundreds of people dancing,
clapping, whooping praise to Holloway, to Montana, to the music.
They shout for the emotion, for the past, for the present. And,
undoubtedly, for the future.
</P>
<P>
   When Holloway finishes, the audience explodes into applause.
Standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The moment is frozen. The gray hairs, gone. Everyone looks 18
again.

&HT;     SOUTHWEST OFFERS BEST SERVICE; UNITED COMES IN LAST, REPORT
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Southwest Airlines provided the best service to
passengers among the nation's 10 major airlines last year,
according to a study released Monday by university researchers.
</P>
<P>
   But for the industry generally, customer complaints jumped 130
percent in 1999 over 1998, fueling speculation that Congress may be
asked again to approve a passengers' bill of rights regulating the
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-based Southwest, which flies to 55 cities and carries
more than 52 million passengers a year, ranked first in two of the
four categories considered by the study _ baggage-handling and a
low number of customer complaints about it to the Department of
Transportation. It was second in on-time arrivals, landing as
scheduled on 80 percent of its flights. In the fourth category,
bumping passengers because of overbooking, it ranked third worst
among the 10 airlines.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines finished last in the study, partly because of a
287 percent hike in complaints against it last year over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumers are fed up with poor service,'' Brent Bowen,
director of the Aviation Institute at the University of Nebraska at
Omaha, said at a news conference here. Bowen and Dean Headley, an
associate professor of marketing at Wichita (Kansas) State
University's business school, co-authored the study, their 10th
annual report on airline performance.
</P>
<P>
   In the overall rankings for 1999, Continental Airlines finished
second, followed by Delta, Northwest, Alaska Airlines, US Airways,
American Airlines, America West, Trans World Airlines and United.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways suffered the steepest drop from 1998, plummeting from
first to sixth place. The 1998 rankings, after US Airways, were
Continental, American, Delta, Southwest, America West, TWA, Alaska,
Northwest and United.
</P>
<P>
   The report said complaints about US Airways' service nearly
quadrupled, its bumping of passengers more than doubled, it
mishandled baggage 20 percent more often and its percentage of
on-time arrivals dropped 7.5 points from 78.9 percent to 71.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Southwest, only Northwest and Alaska improved their
rankings. ``I think we all know from our flying experiences that
things have gotten worse,'' said Headley, He also said the airlines
``seem to have a problem making sure things happen the way they
promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, flights were less likely to arrive on time, and people
were slightly more likely to be bumped because of overbooking. The
only figure that improved was baggage handling. Luggage arrived
late or was lost by airlines 5.08 times for every 1,000 passengers
last year compared with 5.16 times in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The study's release comes about four months after the 10 major
airlines and four other carriers implemented voluntary plans to
make flying more passenger-friendly in order to avoid a
government-imposed passengers' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure had built for such legislation after passengers
testified before Congress about sitting in a plane on a Detroit
tarmac more than seven hours during a snowstorm and about waiting
nine hours at another airport on a plane that never took off.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of passing any measure, Congress agreed last fall to
temporarily allow the airlines to regulate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Under the voluntary program that went into effect last Dec. 15,
the airlines said they would inform customers if there was a better
rate on another airline and would respond to any consumer
complaints in writing within 60 days. They also promised to update
passengers on the status of delayed planes every 15 to 20 minutes
and to do their best to return mishandled baggage within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, which represents the major
airlines, urged consumers to defer judgment on their performance
until next year's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan was only in place for the last two weeks of 1999,''
said Diana Cronan, an ATA spokeswoman. ``A year from now when this
report comes out I think we'll see a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who led the movement last year for a
passengers' bill of rights, disagreed. Lisa Finkel, a Wyden
spokeswoman, said the new report provides the senator with new
ammunition to seek legislation mandating such rights, which she
said
</P>
<P>
   ``are not given the attention they deserve. There really is a
need for across-the-board changes.''

 &HT;    OIL PIPELINE CRITICS LAUNCH NATIONAL SAFETY CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citizen groups and state officials called Monday
for sharply increased regulation of the national network of
underground pipelines that carry millions of gallons of crude oil,
gasoline and other hazardous substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been shameful neglect of safety by both industry and
regulators,'' Robert Rackleff, a county commissioner of Leon
County, Fla., and a longtime pipeline critic, told participants in
a two-day ``National Pipeline Safety Reform Conference.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents of two boys who died last year in the explosion of a
gasoline pipeline in Bellingham, Wash., also spoke and called for
reform in memory of their sons.
</P>
<P>
   Frank King, whose son died in the explosion, brought tears to
the eyes of the audience when he described a bedside vigil at which
doctors told him 10-year-old Wade, a Little League catcher, was
dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember leaning down by Wade's ear an whispering to him,
'It's okay to go. There's a baseball game going on in heaven, and
they need a left-handed catcher.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the meeting said thousands of leaks in the 1990s
had damaged property, fouled natural areas and caused more than 200
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting attracted representatives of community groups from
Florida to Alaska, as well as lawyers and land owners who are
fighting pipeline projects and local officials who say they are
hamstrung by federal officials who are biased in favor of the
industry they are supposed to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the meeting asked participants to press their
senators and congressmen to support bills that would shift much
responsibility for policing more than 200,000 miles of crude oil
pipelines from the federal Office of Pipeline Safety to state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Association of Oil Pipelines, an industry
group, said that ``devolving authority to the states is not going
to enhance pipeline safety.''
</P>
<P>
   She said unhappiness with pipelines is spreading, partly because
of construction of new lines and partly because of publicity about
accidents, but insisted that the industry has reduced the number of
spills and leaks in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, Texas, lawyer Renea Hicks, who represents ranchers who
are fighting plans to use new and existing pipelines to pump
gasoline across Texas from Houston to El Paso, said pipeline
projects tend to spawn unusual coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the city of Austin and Texas's Lower Colorado River
Authority have joined environmentalists, ranchers and other
conservative landowners in questioning the Longhorn Partners
Pipeline Co. proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers tend to be ``much more conservative in other areas of
politics,'' Hicks said. When they are aligned with city and water
authority officials, ``people cannot complain about there being
environmental crazies out there,'' opposing the project, Hicks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rackleff said intense media interest driven by recent pipeline
leaks, including the one leading to the Bellingham explosion, meant
federal pipeline reform legislation might be passed by Congress
this year.
</P>
<P>
   He said Office of Pipeline Safety statistics indicate more than
300 million gallons have spilled from oil pipelines in the last
decade, ``and that does not include nine out of 10 incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Lois Epstein, an engineer with the national environmental group
Environmental Defense(cq) and an organizer of the meeting, cited a
spill last weekend from a fuel line near the nation's capital as
evidence of lax federal oversight. The leak, from a Potomac
Electric Power Co. pipeline, spilled more than 100,000 gallons of
fuel into Maryland's Patuxent River and surrounding wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pipeline ruptures like the one in Maryland are not isolated
incidents,'' said Epstein. ``The Maryland spill follows several
major oil pipeline ruptures this year that have had enormous
environmental consequences.''

(Production notes at end of review) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Small talk, small talk, with other thoughts going
on behind.'' So chants a character from Noel Coward's ``Shadow
Play,'' a one-act exercise with a strangely surreal flavor from
1935. That phrase has been latched upon by certain critics as a
summing up of the Coward technique: an expert deployment of
frivolous chatter spread like a topcoat of meringue across dark and
stormy depths.
</P>
<P>
   But just what happens when the small talk stops, when the
unspeakable is finally spoken? You might ask a couple of
characters, two men of letters in the autumn of their lives, who
were created by Coward in his later years, the central figures in
the tepidly rendered diptych of plays called ``Suite in Two Keys,''
which opened Monday night at the Lucille Lortel Theater.
</P>
<P>
   One of these men is facing imminent death; the other, the
exposure of the contaminating lie that has governed his adult life.
Small talk has suddenly become a very fragile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Coward himself played these roles when both he and the 20th
century were 66 years old, and the fact that the man of the velvet
epigram was clearly ailing by then is said to have infused these
works with a heart-stirring poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in this latest version, directed by John Tillinger with
Paxton Whitehead in the roles originated by Coward, the two
one-acts only rarely deliver on the haunted promises of their
titles: ``Shadows of the Evening'' and ``A Song at Twilight.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, set in the sitting room of a Lausanne hotel suite
(designed in gleaming curves of wood by James Noone), isn't
excruciating. In its favor it has the ever vivacious Judith Ivey, a
whiz at whipping fully detailed characterizations out of thin air,
and a charmingly modest Hayley Mills, the onetime child movie star
(``Pollyanna,'' ``The Parent Trap'') who is only now, at 53, making
her New York stage debut.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this production keeps mortal shadows pale and unthreatening,
with Whitehead's interpretations usually suggesting nothing more
annihilating than a nasty toothache that is dealt with, by turns,
stoically and peevishly. It is the small talk, after all, that
provides the show's principal diversions.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the creators of this revival had something else in mind
in pairing the one-acts as they have. ``Shadows'' and ``Song'' are
part of a trio of playlets that Coward wrote, with a far more
frivolous, satiric work, ``Come Into the Garden, Maud,'' designed
to alternate with ``Shadows'' as a companion piece to ``Song.''
(When ``Suite'' first opened in New York in 1974, under the title
of ``Noel Coward in Two Keys,'' with Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy and
Anne Baxter, it stuck with the ``Song'' and ``Maud'' combination.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Song,'' which was recently seen in London (by itself) in an
acclaimed production starring Corin and Vanessa Redgrave, has
always been the best of the set, hands down. Though etched in
acidic repartee, it is an earnest work, a tale of moral reckoning
for the pompous Hugo Latymer (Whitehead).
</P>
<P>
   Sir Hugo is a venerated novelist with a waspish tongue, an
efficient, browbeaten German secretary of a wife (Mills) and a
hidden homosexual past. His former lover, Carlotta Gray (Ivey), a
vain and ostensibly silly actress, shows up bearing evidence of
that past, and she is determined to make the novelist, who was
partly inspired by Somerset Maugham, writhe in the acknowledgment
of it.
</P>
<P>
   As a subject this was strong meat for Coward, whose own
homosexuality was never publicly paraded. There is an implicit
element of self-flagellation in the systematic needling of Sir Hugo
by Carlotta that could, and should, set off shivers of vicarious
discomfort in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   That this doesn't happen here has everything to do with
Whitehead, who plays his character on a single note of authority
edged in exasperation, something this actor's booming baritone
conveys effortlessly. For ``Song'' to shake us, however, Sir Hugo
must be both an unpleasant man with a streak of elitist sadism, and
a frightened one. Except for one touchingly rendered moment of
collapse, Whitehead seems rather amiable and utterly
self-possessed.
</P>
<P>
   This throws a disproportionate burden onto Ivey, who with her
strapping American persona is not an obvious choice for Carlotta.
But one should never underestimate this actress' resourcefulness,
and here she works minor miracles in portraying Carlotta as an
aging vamp who is as capable of being wounded as of wounding.
</P>
<P>
   With an accent that slides into grating affectation and a body
that doesn't shy from flaunting itself in unflattering ways, Ivey
finds an abrasive vulgarity in Carlotta without erasing the
necessary flickers of dignity and intelligence. If only Whitehead
gave her more to play against. She actually scares up more
chemistry in her brief scenes with Mills, who is quite endearing in
a low-key way as a Teutonic mouse that roars, in which the
characters dance gently between alliance and enmity.
</P>
<P>
   The two women square off more conventionally in the production's
first playlet, ``Shadows,'' with Ivey as the mistress of a
terminally ill publisher (Whitehead) and Mills as the abandoned
wife who has never consented to a divorce and who has now been
enlisted to help him deal with his death.
</P>
<P>
   The actresses again balance each other nicely, with Ivey a
whirlwind of anxieties to Mills' shaky upper-middle-class
sang-froid, and Whitehead's majestic, valiant poise makes more
sense here. But no one overcomes the perfumed starchiness that
pervades the speeches about greeting death gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Song,'' ``Shadows'' isn't really a departure from
familiar Coward formulas; it feels instead like a variation on the
stiff-upper-lip sentimentality of his patriotic plays and
screenplays. Oh, the brave, brittle wit of these souls in jeopardy
as darkness closes in! ``Shadows,'' at least in this
interpretation, feels distressingly like a waxworks tableau.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the likable but toothless Broadway production of
``Waiting in the Wings,'' another late work by Coward, ``Suite'' is
all the New York theater season has come up with in celebration of
the centenary of the playwright's birth. This doesn't seem right.
Theatergoers being thus introduced to the 20th-century's master of
sophisticated comedy will wonder where on earth the bubbles are in
that fabled Coward champagne.

TO BE YOUNG IN ROME, CIRCA 1750

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a city where Jacques-Louis David insisted on working to
execute a momentous commission from the French king; where a
21-year-old aspiring artist from Philadelphia named Benjamin West
was taken to meet the pope; where Fragonard, Piranesi, Antonio
Canova, Angelika Kauffmann and Jean-Antoine Houdon lived, dined,
traded ideas and drank coffee together.
</P>
<P>
   That was Rome in the 18th century. With these artists and many
of other nationalities studying, working, competing and
cross-pollinating, cosmopolitan Rome _ not Paris _ was the cultural
capital of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the thesis of ``The Splendor of 18th-Century
Rome,'' a blockbuster exhibition on view through May 28 at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art. Its team of four curators wants to
disprove the art-historical tenet that Rome ceded its position as
the center of the art universe to Paris at the end of the 17th
century. It is a notion, they say, that gained currency only in the
early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rome is where all the artistic sparks were going on,'' said
Joseph J. Rishel, a senior curator of European paintings at the
Philadelphia museum and one of the organizers. ``It was like Paris
in the 19th century and New York in the late 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this small town of 150,000 people,'' he continued, ``there
were a remarkable number of artists running around. Art and art
news was a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In both art and architecture, quite a bit was accomplished.
Between 1700 and 1800, the exhibition shows, artists in Rome
perfected several late Baroque styles, made innovations in
traditional religious imagery, resuscitated interest in classical
antiquities, stimulated Neo-Classicism and helped lay the
groundwork for Romanticism. True, some of the best-known artists of
the period were French, like David and Houdon, but it is also true
that they blossomed in Rome and produced many of their masterpieces
there.
</P>
<P>
   How radical is the exhibition's thesis? ``This is practically
not taught at all,'' said Keith Christiansen, a curator of European
paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art who is not associated
with the exhibition but says he agrees with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rediscovery,'' he said. ``Our taste for the 18th
century has been Chardin and Watteau. But you don't get to David by
going through Chardin and Watteau; you get to David by going
through Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   With 438 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, religious
artifacts and decorative objects made by more than 160 artists,
``Splendor'' is the most complicated show the Philadelphia museum
has organized to date. The works came from 186 museums, churches,
institutions and private collectors in 16 countries. The curators
called on 65 other scholars to contribute to the huge catalog,
which they hope will become a classic.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it took nine years to make ``Splendor'' a reality. But
the exhibition's roots stretch back even further, to Anthony M.
Clark, an art historian and museum director who died in 1976 at age
53 (while jogging in Rome). In the mid-1950s, Clark had begun
researching and championing 18th-century Rome's role as a cultural
mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the scholars who are now the exhibition's curators
worked with Clark and were infected by his point of view: Rishel;
Ann Percy, the drawings curator at the Philadelphia museum; and
Edgar Peters Bowron, the European art curator at the Museum of Fine
Arts, Houston (where ``Splendor'' will run from June 25 through
Sept. 17).
</P>
<P>
   Clark also knew the fourth organizing curator, Dean Walker,
senior curator of European decorative arts and sculpture at the
Philadelphia museum, and influenced many of the catalog
contributors. In turn, they have imparted Clark's passion for the
Eternal City to a second generation of scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting his revisionism was a big incentive for the
exhibition's organizers, but hardly the only one. Rome in the 18th
century was a visual delight. Civic and religious leaders
commissioned the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain. They built
churches, piazzas, palaces, fountains, monuments, gardens and
galleries. They embellished existing structures, including St.
Peter's Basilica, whose interior was still incomplete at the time.
Rich patrons, both secular and ecclesiastical, nurtured artists
with commissions for paintings and sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Recreating that grandeur was part of the lure and the challenge
for the curators.
</P>
<P>
   Rishel recalls that the idea began to take shape in 1991, when
he, Percy, Bowron and others met for a weekend in Umbria with
Stefano Susinno, an art historian at the University of Rome III who
was part of the exhibition team. ``We filled his house in the
country with books from the University of Rome,'' Rishel said. ``We
swam, we ate, we drank and we played party games, like each
choosing the five most important works we wanted to make the
point.''
</P>
<P>
   To chronicle an entire century, though, hundreds of objects
would be needed. The curators began making lists of those they
might want to borrow, then circulated them and consulted with other
experts. They traveled in Italy and to many other places to observe
firsthand the works that might be used to make their point. As
usual, those trips included visits to places inaccessible to the
public, like the 17th-century Quirinale palazzo of the Principessa
Pallavicini, who agreed to lend a prayer bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just throw your nets as wide as you can,'' said Walker.
``The appeal you make is that you can't do the show without the
object you're requesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The curators produced a master list and a databank of images on
the Philadelphia museum's computer. Then they began winnowing.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Rishel said, the choices were guided by how well an
object fit the themes chosen to give structure to the exhibition:
the makings of modern Rome, Rome as the city of God, palatial Rome,
the private lives of Romans and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The curators said they had surprisingly little trouble arranging
loans. The city of Rome and the Italian government had given their
blessings in 1995, and, as the number of lenders illustrates, other
institutions were enthusiastic about the exhibition's theme.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a rich brew, even though the show lacks brand-name
artists known to the public. ``There aren't any from this time,''
said Walker. ``Seventeenth-century Baroque artists and 19th-century
artists of many schools simply outshine them in common knowledge.
Being able to play star maker, to shine a light on artists that
they believe ought to be better-known, is part of the joy in
curating this show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are any artists of the caliber of a
Bernini or a Caravaggio but there is a host of artists just beneath
that,'' Christiansen of the Met said.
</P>
<P>
   Curators ticked off a number of favorites. There is Giuseppe
Cades. ``He's our pet, a kind of imp who made a self-portrait that
looks like Brad Pitt,'' Rishel said, adding that his altarpiece,
``St. Peter Appearing to Saints Lucy and Agatha,'' was ``one of the
great sleepers of this exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   There is Anton Raphael Mengs, a German who was celebrated as a
new force in painting of his day, evident in his ``Adoration of the
Shepherds.'' At one point, Mengs goes to Spain to paint and meets
Goya, who then goes to Rome, Rishel said. ``Goya would not look
like Goya without Mengs,'' Rishel said.
</P>
<P>
   There is Pierre Legros II, ``a transcendentally great artist who
inherits the fallout of Bernini, refines it, turns it around and
sends sculpture in a new direction that takes you to Houdon,''
Rishel said.
</P>
<P>
   There is Benedetto Luti, who influenced Fragonard and Boucher
and whose ``St. Charles Borromeo Administering Extreme Unction to
Victims of the Plague'' is, Rishel said, ``the most beautiful
painting in the show.'' (His choice for that distinction, however,
has been known to shift from time to time, his colleagues warned.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to mention Rusconi _ I love him,'' Walker insisted.
Carlo Rusconi has four sculptures in the exhibition, including a
marble bust of Pope Clement XI's aunt.
</P>
<P>
   They cited Carlos Maratti (``a god,'' Rishel said), Batoni, of
course (the ``grand old man, who is all about beauty,'' he went on)
and many more.
</P>
<P>
   The public will ultimately decide which, if any, of the
little-known artists in this vast exhibition become brand names. So
far attendance has been good. And, Walker said, ``they are staying
for a long time. That's the best compliment.''

BUSH HAS DONE LITTLE TO IMPROVE TEXAS' POOR HEALTH RECORD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas has had one of the nation's worst public health records
for decades. More than a quarter of its citizens have no health
insurance. Its Mexican border is a hotbed of contagion. The state
ranks near the top in the nation in rates of AIDS, diabetes,
tuberculosis and teen-age pregnancy, and near the bottom in
immunizations, mammograms and access to physicians.
</P>
<P>
   But since George W. Bush became governor in 1995, he has not
made health a priority, his aides acknowledge. He has never made a
speech on the subject, his press office says. His administration
opposed a patient's bill of rights in 1995 before grudgingly
accepting it in 1997, and fought unsuccessfully to limit access to
the new federal Children's Health Insurance Program in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   With health care near the top of the political agenda, Bush is
planning to start discussing health issues soon, possibly as early
as this week. Democrats, not waiting for his proposals, have been
slamming him for his record in Texas. But politics aside, two
things are clear: Texas' health problems run far deeper than the
identity of any office-holder in Austin, and Bush has not tried to
tackle them, despite a large state budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In the critical area of expanding insurance coverage, Bush's
administration has moved slowly. Among Texans of working age, the
percentage without coverage rose slightly under Bush and is higher
than in any state but Arizona. The numbers are even worse among
poor children, and hundreds of thousands of them are not enrolled
in Medicaid even though they qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to be interviewed for this article, but the views
expressed by the state's commissioner of health, Dr. William R.
Archer III, cast a light on the Bush administration's approach to
the issue. (Archer said the governor asked him to apply for the
commissioner's job; he was formally chosen by the Board of Health
in 1997, and took office after Bush approved the appointment.)
</P>
<P>
   Almost alone among health experts in Texas, Archer minimizes the
importance of the low rate of health insurance _ a protection that
two-fifths of the state's poor children lack. In an interview,
Archer said that while ``eventually we have to insure everybody,''
he believed the uninsured were still getting care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think insurance is important,'' he said. ``But I don't think
it's the most important thing.'' He said he doubted that coverage
made much real difference to health.
</P>
<P>
   When told of Archer's view, one of the state's leaders in public
health, Dr. Ron Anderson of Parkland Hospital in Dallas, said,
``Then he hasn't read the literature. Shame on him!''
</P>
<P>
   Archer also accused Texas doctors of opposing preventive health
care out of misplaced concern for their own billings. ``If I can
prevent certain diseases upstream, and then there is no need to
treat that disease, then there is nothing to charge against,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And he has stirred disputes with his efforts to move his
department away from the traditional services it has provided to
examine the cultural and spiritual causes of unhealthy behavior and
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said Texas' high teen-age pregnancy rate came
about because the state's Hispanic population lacked ``the belief
in your culture that getting pregnant is a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to go to an Hispanic community and say `Well, we
need to get you into family planning,' they say, `No, I want to be
pregnant,''' he said. ``It doesn't work very well.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a private research
organization, Hispanic teen-agers in Texas had a higher pregnancy
rate than whites or blacks, but the white rate was among the
nation's highest, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the health problems of Texas go back far beyond Bush and
Archer. Texas ranks 25th in per-capita income, just ahead of
Oregon, but taxes itself lightly and provides a modest level of
public services. Only six states collect a smaller percentage of
their citizens' personal income in state and local taxes than Texas
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flip side of having no income tax is having a very low
level of services,'' said Anne Dunkelberg, a senior policy analyst
at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a nonprofit research
group in Austin representing low-income taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Archer hit the nail on the head when he explained why the state
tolerated having 598,000 children eligible for Medicaid _ the
federal-state health plan for the poor _ but not enrolled in the
program: ``The problem is that the Legislature knows that if we are
successful, and we got all those kids registered, they would not
balance their budgets any more. It's not one person saying `Don't
do this.' It's not one agency saying `Don't do this.' It's sort of
`Why would we all rock the boat at this point?'''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Archer, most prominent health experts in Texas see
the low insurance rates as the state's biggest health problem.
Clair Jordan, executive director of the Texas Nurses Association,
said ``uninsured children end up in the most costly place _ the
emergency room.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Elliott Naishtat, a Democrat who is chairman of the
House Human Services Committee, said, ``The biggest health problem
in Texas is the exorbitant number of people, primarily children,
who have no health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Without insurance, said Jose Camacho, head of the Texas
Association of Community Health centers, children get only sporadic
treatment at best for ear infections, asthma and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance coverage in Texas has been stagnant for several
years. According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the
Uninsured, among Texans 19 to 65 years old, 27.5 percent were
uninsured in 1998, compared to 19.7 percent for the nation. In
1994, before Bush took office, the Texas percentage was 26.5 and
the national figure 17.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among poor children the coverage was much worse. In 1998 39.1
percent of Texans under 18 living at no more than twice the poverty
level lacked insurance, compared to 25.7 percent nationally. In
1994, 36.7 percent of poor children in Texas and 22.8 percent of
poor children nationally were uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for the low rates of insurance, including
migratory labor, a large rural population and many low-wage workers
in nonunion jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the single biggest reason is probably the state's Medicaid
program, which has some of the nation's most severe limits and
complicated eligibility rules and thus makes Texas ``one of the
most difficult states for someone to figure out how to get
enrolled,'' according to Diane Rowland, executive vice president of
the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group that
focuses on health issues.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Garnet Coleman, a Democrat from Houston who is vice
chairman of the House Public Health Committee, contended the state
had created an ``atmosphere of fear'' around applying for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Bertha Rochel, a housewife interviewed at an El Paso clinic,
said some of her neighbors did not seek Medicaid because ``they are
afraid and maybe some of their children are illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some others would find their citizenship applications barred if
they sought government benefits now. Camacho pointed to the Texas
rule that missing an appointment meant a Medicaid applicant had to
start over.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children without health insurance _ now at 1.4 to
1.5 million _ may drop sharply in the next year when Texas finally
starts enrolling children in the children's health insurance
program, known as CHIP, which was enacted by Congress in 1997. Bush
let the question wait until the 1999 legislative session, and
fought to limit the program's coverage to children with family
incomes up to 150 percent of the poverty line, although the federal
law allowed covering children up to 200 percent of the poverty
level.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush approach would have excluded 200,000 of the 500,000 who
became eligible when the Legislature insisted on the higher level.
Bush, who declined to be interviewed for this article, said at a
news conference in Sacramento, Calif., on Thursday, ``I signed the
200 percent bill'' and would not say why he pushed for 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The reason given at the time for Bush's position, legislators
said, was a fear that a big new program would be costly by itself
and turn up a ``spillover'' of many thousands who were already
eligible for Medicaid, where the income ceiling is 100 percent of
poverty. The federal government reimburses Texas 61.5 cents out of
every dollar spent for Medicaid, and will pay 75 cents on the
dollar for CHIP.
</P>
<P>
   The state has never used the millions of federal dollars made
available by the 1996 welfare law to reach out to potential
Medicaid enrollees, but has a large effort planned for CHIP. Don
Gilbert, the state Commissioner of Health and Human Services (which
handles Medicaid enrollment), said he expected to enroll 420,000
children in CHIP and perhaps another 120,000 in Medicaid over the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The worst health problems in Texas, with disease rates at Third
World levels, is on the Mexican border. Almost a fourth of the
state's population lives in 43 border counties along the 1,264
miles of the Rio Grande River from El Paso to Brownsville, and as
far from the river as San Antonio, about 125 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Except for San Antonio, it is a poor area. El Paso, Laredo,
McAllen and Brownsville are four of the five poorest cities in the
country. About a third of the population lives below the federal
poverty level. All but two of the counties have a shortage of
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   A state report published in 1998 observed that ``health
conditions in the Texas-Mexico border are among the worst in the
U.S., so distressful that reports on health conditions suggest a
remote country in need of medical missionaries, not a part of
Texas.'' For example, it said, ``cases of hepatitis A, a
gastrointestinal virus borne by contaminated food and water, are
four times as common in the Rio Grande Valley as in the rest of
Texas.'' Tuberculosis, diabetes, and dengue fever are other
high-incidence diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The border is an area where some improvement has been made in
recent years, but very slowly, said Dr. Laurance N. Nickey, a
retired city-county health director who now serves on the
bi-national border health commission. He said 72,000 people (about
a tenth of El Paso's population) live in unincorporated colonias,
or settlements, where ``some of the water is safe to drink,'' and
less than half have safe sewerage.
</P>
<P>
   As primitive as some conditions are on the U.S. side of the
border, they are worse in Mexico. Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.6
million people across from El Paso, is just building its first two
sewage treatment plants. Until now, a 17-mile open trench, mostly
unlined, has been used for sewage disposal, and it pollutes the
groundwater on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said Bush had persuaded the Mexican authorities to put
money into tuberculosis control, a move they had resisted because
the border states in Mexico are not nearly its poorest.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso alone sees about 65 million legal border crossings a
year. ``With this kind of a rate of crossings,'' said Nickey, ``you
don't keep measles on one side of the border and chicken pox on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share the same air. We share the same water. We share the
same pollution. We share the same hazardous waste,'' he said. And
because the border counties are a gateway to the rest of Texas and
the rest of the country, he said, ``it's not just a border issue.
It involves the whole United States.''

TOKYO GOVERNOR CRITICIZED FOR ANTI-IMMIGRANT COMMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The governor of Tokyo has set off a swell of criticism
in diplomatic circles and foreign communities here by saying that
immigrants in Japan, mainly people of Korean and Chinese descent,
were likely to riot after a major earthquake. The governor,
Shintaro Ishihara, called on Japan's military to be prepared to
maintain order during such an uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the shock and dismay of many Japanese and foreigners
alike, Ishihara referred to immigrants as sangokujin, a derogatory
term used in Japan after the country was defeated in World War II
to tell Korean and Chinese residents to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atrocious crimes have been committed again and again by
sangokujin and other foreigners,'' Ishihara said during the weekend
at a ceremony of the Ground Self-Defense Force, Japan's equivalent
of an army. ``We can expect them to riot in the event of a
disastrous earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sangokujin'' literally means people from third countries and
was used, not as an insult, by the Allied Forces who occupied Japan
after World War II to refer to people who were not Japanese or from
the occupying forces. But the Japanese gave the word a xenophobic
twist, and it is rarely used today except as a sharp insult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police have their limits,'' Ishihara said. ``I hope you will
not only fight against disasters but also maintain public security
on such occasions. I hope you will show the Japanese people and the
Tokyo people what the military is for in a state.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's comments were particularly painful to many
Koreans living in Japan because they revived memories of the racial
violence that flared after an earthquake struck Tokyo and Yokohama
in 1923, killing 97,000 people. Korean residents were blamed for
setting fires and looting, and several thousand ethnic Koreans in
these cities were massacred by Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``These remarks bring the nightmare home to us of the
groundless, hostile rumor of the 1923 earthquake by which many
innocent comrades were victimized just because they were
foreigners,'' the Korean Resident Union in Japan, which represents
about 600,000 South Koreans, said in a statement. ``The comment is
also something that has the potential to ruin friendships between
many Japanese and many foreign residents in Japan who had hoped to
create a society in which they can coexist.''
</P>
<P>
   Chu Kyu-ho, the political minister for the South Korean Embassy
in Tokyo, said that while Ishihara's remarks were not likely to
sour the current good relations between the countries, the governor
had damaged Japan's reputation internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the Japanese people will disavow his remarks
because they are so inappropriate and so ridiculous,'' Chu said.
``But what really worries me is that many Japanese don't know their
own history and may not even understand what's behind this sort of
remark.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Korean residents of Japan are descendants of Koreans who
were forcibly brought here to work as laborers during Japan's
colonization of the Korean peninsula in the early 1900s. Choe
Kwan-ik, deputy director of international affairs for the General
Association of Korean Residents in Japan, which represents
displaced North Koreans in Japan, said that until Japan apologizes
for the atrocities it committed in Asia and makes reparations, its
officials would continue to make comments like Ishihara's.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   South Korean and Chinese have long expressed concern that
Ishihara, who was elected last April, would use his position as
governor of Japan's most populous region as a stage from which to
promote his nationalist views. A spokesman for Ishihara said he was
traveling Monday and would have no comment. The outspoken governor,
who is best known for his 1989 anti-American book, ``The Japan That
Can Say No,'' has in the past called for Japan to develop nuclear
weapons and dismissed the 1937 Rape of Nanking, in which Japanese
troops killed tens of thousands of Chinese, as a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists and political analysts noted that Ishihara's
comments came at a time when an undercurrent of intolerance for
foreigners was growing in Japanese society although the country is
suffering from a sharp decline in its economy and population and
must increasingly rely on immigrants to get by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our birthrate is shrinking and the number of elderly is
growing so quickly that we will need foreign laborers to nurse
them,'' said Hiroshi Tanaka, a civics professor at Ryukoku
University in Kyoto. ``People realize that we can't survive without
foreigners, but that's no reason to be afraid.''

<P>
   The impact was in the close-ups. When the naked television
camera came in tight on Richard Dreyfuss or Brian Dennehy, when
their anguished faces filled the screen and their characters' souls
filled your heart, then it was clear that the drama transcended the
stunt. In those moments the CBS adaptation of ``Fail Safe,''
broadcast live to much of the country on Sunday night, lived up to
its billing as an event. It proved that this medium's intimate
immediacy is an underused asset waiting to be exploited in the
service of compelling storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   The show's ultimate impact was blunted by far too much talky
(and often preachy) exposition, by some of the project's
self-imposed technical limitations and by the stop-and-start rhythm
dictated by the commercials. But ``Fail Safe'' demonstrated the
vast potential of a carefully mounted television production _ not a
bargain-basement movie, not a stage play glimpsed from the
footlights _ to thrill an audience.
</P>
<P>
   This grim morality tale of the Cold War, with its
slap-you-in-the-face 1960s warning about the imminent danger of
world destruction, seems an odd choice as the vehicle for
television's redemption. In 1962, when the novel by Harvey Wheeler
and Eugene Burdick was published, and in 1964, when the Sidney
Lumet film version was released, the story of an accidental attack
on Moscow by American bombers tapped fears as real as the morning
headlines. The spare, serious film, following on the heels of the
wildly satirical ``Dr. Strangelove,'' was enthusiastically
welcomed. In The New York Times, Bosley Crowther wrote, ``It packs
a melodramatic wallop that will rattle a lot of chattering teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The relentless publicity for Sunday's show announced by every
available means that the film had had a profound effect on young
George Clooney, who grew up to become a big-deal actor and the
godfather of the television version. He had the standing to dictate
the terms of engagement for this black-and-white production.
</P>
<P>
   His vision may have been flawed, but it convinced CBS to mount
its first live drama in 39 years and attracted a cadre of fine
actors, the writer Walter Bernstein (author of the 1964 movie
script) and the film director Stephen Frears (``High Fidelity,''
``The Grifters''). Their efforts probably did not set many teeth to
chattering, but the show packed its own kind of wallop.
</P>
<P>
   As the misguided bomber speeds to its target, the story darts
among four locations. In the Omaha war room, a weary general
(Dennehy) tries to guide his men through the crisis under the gaze
of two visitors, an acerbic congressman (Sam Elliott) and a
computer executive (James Cromwell) whose company made the
equipment that has been programmed to choreograph the attack. In
the cockpit of the last bomber to make it to Moscow, the pilots
(Clooney and Don Cheadle) carry out their assignment as they, too,
have been programmed.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting of high-level strategists, the secretary of defense
(Norman Lloyd) tries to keep order as a cold-blooded consultant
(Hank Azaria) takes boundless joy in the events that a moral
warrior (Harvey Keitel) sees only as a tragedy. And in Washington
the noble president (Dreyfuss) confronts his powerlessness as he
tries to bargain by telephone with his Soviet counterpart with the
aid of a translator (Noah Wyle).
</P>
<P>
   Each of these characters is a one-dimensional, one-adjective
pawn in a chess game headed for tragic checkmate. (This sterling
president may be one of the show's most anachronistic elements.)
They all spend most of the drama's two hours explaining to one
another what has happened and what is about to happen. So Dreyfuss'
president must say to Wyle: ``OK Buck. Tell you what we're gonna
do. I'm going to talk to the Soviet premier.'' Then he does.
</P>
<P>
   But when you've forgotten the speeches, you'll remember the
looks on those faces. Some combination of the actors' talent,
Frears' skill, Clooney's commitment and the adrenaline that must
have been surging produced those moments. There was ice in Azaria's
eyes. There was the deepest kind of loss in Keitel's. Life was in
those details.
</P>
<P>
   Let there be no more talk of going back to the Golden Age of
Television. Memories of such golden ages _ of baseball, of
newspapers, of doughnuts _ tend to be hopelessly clouded by
nostalgia. Yes, television used to have live drama nearly every
night because that was one of the things that early television knew
how to do. But for every ``Marty'' and ``Requiem for a
Heavyweight'' there were hours of fodder, cranked out to feed the
hungry medium.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney and his team chose to accept only some of the old
limitations. The play was shown in letter-box format (with black
bands across the top and bottom of the screen), to provide stark
vertical images, some looking into deep, lavishly assembled sets.
But commercial television doesn't need slavish homages to the past.
It does need to deepen its vocabulary, and now it knows it can.
There are books and plays calling out more compellingly for
adaptation than ``Fail Safe.'' There are writers who can be
encouraged to produce memorable new scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Is a broadcast renaissance at hand? Get serious. But if the
networks do get serious, even once in a while, there could be
golden moments ahead.

&HT;     DRAFT MAY OFFER NINERS WITH A MUCH-NEEDED QB 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three years ago, the 49ers thought they had
their idealized Quarterback of the Future when they made Jim
Druckenmiller their No. 1 pick in the 1997 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Druckenmiller is more likely Miami's
quarterback of the future. He was ridden out of San Francisco on a
trail of disparaging comments by general manager Bill Walsh just
before the start of the '99 season.
</P>
<P>
   With Steve Young's status still unsettled and Jeff Garcia the
only other quarterback on the roster, the 49ers are compelled to
look for a QB in the upcoming draft. Whether Young returns or walks
away from the game, the time is now for San Francisco to find and
develop a quarterback for the club to rebuild around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get the best quarterback we can,'' coach Steve
Mariucci said. ``Whoever it is, we'll develop him and improve his
skills.``
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the QB cornucopia of 1999, there's only one quarterback
of first-round quality in this draft, Marshall's Chad Pennington.
If they stay where they are at No. 12, the 49ers should have a
chance to get Pennington _ if they really like him that high.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci sounded less than fired up about Pennington, saying,
``I think he's a good player. I believe he'll be the first
quarterback who's going to be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Through hard work, Pennington built himself into a
6-foot-3-inch, 229-pound prospect. After leading the Thundering
Herd (college football's best nickname) to a 13-0 record and
passing for 3,797 yards and 37 touchdowns last season, he spent six
weeks at the International Performance Institute in Bradenton,
Fla., honing his body to professional standards.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington is smart (3.8 grade-point average) and fast enough
for a quarterback (4.9 for 40 yards). He's a polished player at the
position, lacking only the same kind of cannon arm that did so much
good for Druckenmiller while he was a 49er. In other words,
Pennington can make most all of the throws a quarterback has to
make, particularly in San Francisco's style of offense.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Pennington, the 49ers like three other quarterbacks
in this draft _ Tim Rattay of Louisiana Tech, Tee Martin of
Tennessee and Giovanni Carmazzi of Hofstra. Of the three, Carmazzi
might be the best prospect, although he played on a lower level of
competition in college. Martin was Peyton Manning's backup in
1996-97. Rattay is just a shade over 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three would be guys we like, in addition to Pennington,''
said Terry Donahue, the 49ers director of player personnel.
``They're guys we'd like to have, those mobile-type quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Since defense is such a screaming maniac of a need for the
49ers, they might take a pass on Pennington at No. 12 and go for a
cornerback, linebacker or defensive end instead. All told, the
49ers have 10 picks in the draft's seven rounds, including three in
the first 35 selections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to find some defensive starters and certainly add to
our defensive depth,'' Mariucci said. ``We want to add to our
quarterback depth chart and probably one offensive lineman. We're
certainly going to major on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   However, with the way most draft projections play out,
Pennington at No. 12 seems to make the most sense, especially since
the 49ers figure to have a shot at the best cornerback in the
draft, Ohio State's Ahmed Plummer, when their turn comes up again
in the first round at No. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking generally about cornerbacks, Mariucci said, ``That
would be our hope, to get at least one starter and another guy who
would eventually start.''
</P>
<P>
   They may already have such a player on the roster. Cornerback
Anthony Parker, last year's fourth-round pick, did not play at all
in '99 because of a knee injury. Neither did defensive tackle
Reggie McGrew, last year's No. 1 pick. Guard Tyrone Hopson and wide
receiver Tai Streets played sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and McGrew could see significant playing time this
season, and Streets could be the third receiver if Jerry Rice does
not return. In a sense, the 49ers are looking at Parker, McGrew and
Streets as delayed draft picks to augment the players they will
select next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at them as redshirt freshmen,'' Mariucci said. ``Last
year's class will add to this year's class. We'll have a lot of
youth on the field. We're going to make that a positive thing.
We're going to start with a fairly young team and develop them into
professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers will go into this draft with a mandate to get faster,
especially on the edges on both sides of the ball. Streets should
bring improved speed to the wide receiver group. On defense last
year, the 49ers were routinely torched by receivers simply running
past their collection of no-talent cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a very fast team,'' Donahue said. ``We need to
become a faster team. We're trying to put an emphasis on speed and
trying to say, if nothing else, let's be sure we come out of here
with increased speed.''
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to leave out quarterback Chris Redman as a
prospect. The Louisville slugger did himself no good by running a
plodding 5.3 time for 40 yards at the combine; there are 300-pound
offensive linemen who run faster than that.
</P>
<P>
   Other than quarterback and cornerback, the 49ers will try to
find an outside linebacker to take Lee Woodall's spot in the lineup
(Michigan State's Julian Peterson?); a strong safety to compete
with Zack Bronson for the starting job (Tennessee's Deon Grant?);
an offensive tackle with offensive tackle size (Mississippi's Todd
Wade? Wisconsin's Chris McIntosh?); and a defensive end with
pass-rush skills (Virginia Tech's John Engelberger?)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fun,'' Donahue said. ``Last year, Jevon
Kearse was a sure-fire top 10 pick, guaranteed. And he went 16th.
There are a lot of different things that happen on draft day. And
it's exciting.''

WASHINGTON BRACES FOR PROTESTS AT GLOBAL ECONOMICS MEETINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Pa.)   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A law enforcement armada from a half-dozen city and
federal agencies is preparing for mass rallies here this week as
protesters try to extend the demonstrations against global
economics that plunged Seattle into violent street confrontations
in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the process of training drills with our mounted units
and SWAT teams,'' said Sgt. Rob MacLean of the U.S. Park Police.
``If a situation occurs like the one in Seattle, we'll be
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the Metropolitan Police Department has been studying
the shortcomings of Seattle's attempt at protest control and
stocking up on fresh tear gas and rubber bullets. The department,
which has deep experience in containing capital demonstrations, has
trained a special force of 1,400 officers in the latest
baton-and-shield techniques of crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are emphasizing the city's openness to peaceful
protests while also preparing for the civil disobedience that some
demonstrators have threatened will disrupt meetings of the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arrests will be quick, swift and certain,'' the executive
assistant police chief, Terrance W. Gainer, has warned potential
troublemakers as the department readies detention areas in the
event of mass arrests. ``We won't be caught sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's National Guard unit will be available to assist, but
there is no plan to place soldiers among the hundreds of federal
and city officers who will be assigned to keep the capital clear of
trouble. The law enforcement effort includes the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Secret Service and U.S. Marshals Service, plus
dozens of bomb detection specialists from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman said that seven demonstrators were arrested
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were John Passacantando, executive director of Ozone
Action, and Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth,
who were arrested by Metropolitan Police officers when they refused
to climb down from a truck near the World Bank headquarters on
Pennsylvania Avenue, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Using the top of the large truck as a makeshift stage, the heads
of the two national environmental groups, along with about 50
people, gathered in the street to protest the World Bank's
financing of oil, gas and mining projects.
</P>
<P>
   Under the umbrella title Mobilization for Global Justice,
organizers are promising that thousands of protesters from a raft
of causes with global economic implications _ from famine to
deforestation, political corruption to global warming _ will come
to Washington this weekend. A planned week of teach-ins, legal
rallies and street entertainment is to culminate April 16 and 17,
when protesters vow to block the two world economic gatherings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In planning bus caravans, mass feeding operations and lessons in
street protest, organizers are disavowing violence but emphasizing
their intentions to build on the events in Seattle. There, police
eventually arrested 600 people in three days of protests that
veered into vandalism during a meeting of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finance ministers and international bureaucrats who shape
the world economy to make the rich richer and the poor poorer need
to know that Seattle was not just a bump on their road to global
domination,'' the mobilization group is emphasizing on its Web site
(www.a16.org).
</P>
<P>
   Police intelligence specialists have been trying to track the
Seattle protesters' efforts to enlarge their cause nationally.
Detectives from the Philadelphia Police Department plan to monitor
the Washington protest in preparation for the Republican Party
convention in Philadelphia this summer. Some of the protest groups
from the Seattle and Washington demonstrations have put the
convention on their target list.
</P>
<P>
   During past protests where civil disobedience was threatened,
the police have not hesitated to close off large parts of downtown
Washington and tightly limit protesters to well-patrolled, confined
areas. No such plan has yet been announced. Last summer streets
were closed when a neo-Nazi group obtained a rally permit and
attracted thousands of angry counter-demonstrators. There was no
confrontation, as only a few neo-Nazis showed up, and the city
spent an estimated $1 million in overtime pay for hundreds of
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be nice, but we don't expect it this time,'' said

 &HT;    What is the future of American theater?
 &HT;    Expect shorter works and maybe a gimmick or two
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Rape, misunderstood artists and new
</P>
<P>
   technologies.
</P>
<P>
   These are the preoccupations of the American theater in this new
millennium, or at least the issues consuming the Tony Award-winning
Actors Theatre of Louisville. As it has for the past 24 years, it
took the temperature of the American stage and its playwrights last
weekend with a fevered showcase of premieres known collectively as
the Humana Festival of New American Plays.
</P>
<P>
   For 72 hours, this genteel Southern town became the center of
the theater world, unveiling seven full-length plays, three
10-minute scripts and five brief scenes delivered over, yes, the
telephone. In total, 31 writers' work was represented, giving the
perhaps illusory impression that the American theater is busy and
healthy, though mired in dark, brooding subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The festival built its reputation on sending to New York such
acclaimed plays as D.L. Coburn's ``The Gin Game'' and Beth Henley's
``Crimes of the Heart.'' In recent years, as Broadway has grown
indifferent to new plays, the festival has sent its wares into the
nonprofit regional network. The city of Manalapan's Florida Stage
has been a prime consumer, for instance, producing six festival
scripts in the past seven seasons, including such intriguing works
as ``Keely &AMP; Du,'' ``Below the Belt'' and its current show, ``God's
Man in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the festival produces so much new work, theater writers
search it closely for clues to the mind-set of today's American
playwrights. Actors Theatre producing director Jon Jory who leaves
the company this fall after 31 years to teach theater at Seattle's
University of Washington _ notes that his selections have never
been based on thematic similarities. However, he recalls reading
with amusement a decade ago that the most significant recurring
motif of that year's festival was ``offstage barking dogs.'' Anyone
remember that trend filtering elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   'Years of turmoil'
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was hard to miss this festival's preoccupation with
the consequences of sexual violence, mainly but not exclusively
against women. The aftermath of date rape is the subject of two
emerging 20-something writers, Stephen Belber (''Tape'') and
Alexandra Cunningham (''No. 11,'' ``Blue and White''). Veteran
playwright Charles L. Mee gives sexual politics a classical and
often comic spin with ``Big Love,'' a modern version of Aeschylus,
in which 50 sisters who are forced into marriage resolve to kill
the grooms on their wedding night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in personal terms, the past 30 years of turmoil in the
relations between men and women has churned up a lot of passion,''
comments Mee. ``I think a lot of men who were reluctant to speak up
for their own points of view have started speaking out a little
more. I think a lot of people have looked back at the Greeks
specifically to see what we've forgotten about what it is to be
human.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida Stage producing director Louis Tyrrell is high on Mee's
``Big Love'' but is more interested in obtaining the rights to
Belber's ``Tape,'' perhaps for next season. ``The threads of the
piece created solid fabric,'' he enthuses. ``It deals with
contemporary values in a very important way, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at the festival were City Theatre co-producers Susie
Westfall and Stephanie Norman, who have already arranged to produce
10-minute plays by Tina Howe and David Ives in this year's Summer
Shorts in Miami. And it will likely be just a matter of time before
some company in South Florida grabs the festival's hit, Jane
Martin's ``Anton in Show Business,'' particularly popular with the
industry audience of critics, artistic directors and film
executives.
</P>
<P>
   It is both a satirical valentine to the theater and _ to stretch
the thematic tie-in a bit _ an illustration of how artistic efforts
get raped in the name of corporate sponsorship, star package
productions and unbridled ego. Also looking to show business for
metaphor was director Anne Bogart, who conceived and directed ``War
of the Worlds,'' a production full of stage magic about the
tumultuous, rejected career of Orson Welles, from ``Wunderkind'' to
jug-wine pitchman.
</P>
<P>
   If these were the most compelling plays the festival uncovered
this year _ from more than 700 scripts submitted _ that is also a
reflection of the dearth of plays dealing with larger political
subjects, of dissent and unrest. Perhaps it is a reflection of good
economic times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone in the country has been benefitting from the
economy, but for those who are, for the moment that's one worry
removed that allows your mind to move elsewhere,'' Jory suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Just because financial indicators are positive, some theater
artists still feel beleaguered. The latest perceived threat seems
to be the Internet, which not only keeps theatergoers in their
homes but is seen as a competing delivery system for theatrical
material.
</P>
<P>
   Bogart disagrees, believing there will be a backlash in the
years ahead. ``I think there's more and more of a longing to
breathe common air with other people,'' she says. ``The more
computerized and virtual we live our lives, the bigger theater can
become.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fear the Internet, Mee sees it as a potential boon.
``I think it's the global culture that's going to change the
theater, because the Internet has shrunk the globe. It has to
affect the way we make plays. It's a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Impact of technology
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, because of interchange with other cultures and
traditions, the American theater has become more stylized. More and
more, the neo-Expressionistic influences of Eastern Europe, the
abstractions of the Asian stage and the formalism of the classics
have been showing up in new productions over here. ``There was this
crashing realization that realism was just another style. That was
the lagoon we swam in, and it didn't occur to us that it was part
of a larger ocean,'' Jory says. ``A lot of it came from exposure to
other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology continues to have a major impact on theatrical form,
and the festival has been dabbling with its own experiments in play
delivery. Last year's festival featured plays printed on T-shirts.
A more enduring novelty _ some would say ``gimmick'' _ is ``The
Phone Play.'' For the second consecutive year, Actors Theatre
patrons lined up to listen to two- to three-minute conversation
snippets over phones installed in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is persuaded. ``It doesn't excite me at all,'' says
Bogart. ``I'm not drawn to pick up a phone. But whatever gets
people in the building, I celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the American theater, looking back from the
perspective of one more century, is going to point to ``The Phone
Play'' as its central esthetic,'' concedes Jory, its initiator.
Still, it is a novelty that creates attention and attendance for
his festival, which is its own justification. He further predicts
that a year or two from now, as the search for new forms continues,
that bank of phones might well be replaced by a pod of
Internet-linked computers.
</P>
<P>
   Phone plays may be brief by necessity, but they point out
another trend in theater _ the intermission-less play. Five of the
seven ``full-length'' plays presented at the Humana Festival ran
about 90 minutes, without a halftime strolling opportunity for the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something wonderful about an audience coming in and
being in that world until they're released from it,'' says Mee,
whose ``Big Love'' has no intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think actors love the idea that the audience doesn't have a
chance to get out,'' Jory adds.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sir Peter Hall flew in to Louisville last
week for a media blitz to publicize a production of a new 15-hour
play called ``Tantalus,'' based on ancient Greek political history,
which he will premiere in Denver in October. It purports to be the
longest single production in the 2,500-year history of theater.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is a sign of the theater's health in the new millennium
that every trend has an equal and opposite counter-trend.

TESTS OF CAMPSITE SHOW HUMAN OCCUPATION OF VIRGINIA 15,000 YEARS
AGO 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ New dating tests and other evidence are
encouraging archaeologists to think that a campsite in southeastern
Virginia was occupied by people more than 15,000 years ago and thus
could contain the earliest known traces of human beings in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   The findings appear to lend further support to the growing
belief that the New World was occupied thousands or tens of
thousands of years earlier than once thought. When, where and how
people first came to the New World is the oldest mystery of
American archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   In reports here at the annual meeting of the Society for
American Archaeology, scientists described strong new evidence that
they said confirmed an early age for campfire charcoal, stone tools
and other remains at a site called Cactus Hills, 45 miles southeast
of Richmond. Other archaeologists said they were impressed by the
research, but were reserving judgment pending further
investigations at Cactus Hill and other sites in the eastern United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph M. McAvoy, director of the Cactus Hill excavations,
reported new radiocarbon tests showing human occupation at two
distinct levels in the sandy soil at Cactus Hill. The upper level,
about two feet deep, was dated at about 11,000 years ago. A few
inches below, white-pine charcoal was dated at 15,000 years, but
could be as old as 17,000.
</P>
<P>
   What is especially remarkable, archaeologists said, is that the
discovery appears to reveal two distinct cultures at the two
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The people who built campfires there 11,000 years ago had stone
projectile points made in the style developed by what are known as
the Clovis people. Similar stone weapons were first discovered in
the 1930s near the town of Clovis, N.M., and have since been found
at many sites dated at 10,000 to 11,200 years ago. For several
decades, these people were assumed to be the founding population of
today's American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, after years of bitter dispute, leading
archaeologists established that an apparently pre-Clovis people had
been living as far south as Chile at least 12,500 years ago. Now,
at Cactus Hill's lower level, archaeologists have found blade-type
stone tools that appear to have been used for butchering meat and
processing hides, but nothing closely resembling Clovis spear
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the pre-Clovis world,'' said Dr. Dennis Stanford,
an archaeologist at the Smithsonian Institution, commenting on the
mounting evidence of earlier American occupation. Other places
where pre-Clovis people may have lived in the Eastern United States
include the Meadowcroft rock shelter near Pittsburgh and the Topper
site near the Savannah River in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McAvoy and other scientists who examined Cactus Hill said they
had ruled out the possibility that contamination or shifting of
deposits had given them false dates. An independent dating test
produced similar ages and confirmed that the sands were not
redeposited from younger levels into the deeper levels. Mineralized
plant remains also supported the conclusion that people were living
there 15,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, this is not even a close call,'' McAvoy said
of the evidence for a pre-Clovis occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robson Bonnichsen, an archaeologist at Oregon State
University in Corvallis, said the ``many lines of evidence''
advanced by McAvoy's team were ``really impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must now take Cactus Hill seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The site is just south of the Nottoway River in Sussex County on
land owned by the International Paper Corp. The first traces of the
campsite were first found in the 1980s. McAvoy began excavation
there in 1993 with the support of the Virginia Department of
Historic Resources and the National Geographic Society.

   ATLANTA _ Home Depot will begin selling Maytag brands at
warehouse stores next month as the retailer rolls out a major
appliance expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The Maytag partnership fills a void left by Whirlpool Corp.,
which was dropped from Home Depot's appliance launch this year
after the manufacturer had problems making deliveries during the
first few months of the rollout.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have expected Home Depot to partner with Maytag as it
continued the launch with only General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maytag is a necessary addition to our business,'' said Davis
Poole, manager of logistics and implementation for Atlanta-based
Home Depot's national appliance rollout. ``We had been looking at
them from the beginning.'' Home Depot already sells Maytag brands
at 15 Expo Design Centers.
</P>
<P>
   Maytag brands, including its Jenn-Air cooking appliances, will
debut at Home Depot stores in Jacksonville, Fla., next month. Home
Depot will expand distribution to selected markets several weeks
later and expects all of its U.S. stores to carry Maytag appliances
by year end.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric appliances are available at nearly 400 stores
now and should be in most of Home Depot's U.S. stores by the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
   Appliances could add as much as $2 billion in annual sales to
Home Depot, according to analysts' estimates. Sears, which sells
about $5 billion in appliances a year, has long dominated the
category although it faces increasing competition from Circuit
City, Best Buy and Lowe's Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City, for example, announced last month it was testing
freestanding appliance stores in Virginia and Florida.

<P>
   HILVERSUM, Netherlands _ Oprah Winfrey dropped out of shock
television long ago. Maury Povich migrated from audience shout
fests to the million-dollar quiz biz. Even Fox TV was shaken enough
by the fallout from ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' to
quash a plan to crash a jet into the desert for prime-time
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But a European producer, John de Mol, is convinced that
``reality'' television hasn't come close to the boundaries of the
possible. Witness his latest brainstorm, ``Chains of Love,'' a
post-millennial evolution of ``The Dating Game'' that had its
premiere last week on Dutch television.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Chains,'' four men compete for a date with one woman while
all five are chained together in handcuffs and ankle-irons for five
days. The woman cuts loose the suitors one at a time until the one
man left on the last day gets a big cash prize and the date.
</P>
<P>
   Too outlandish for the United States? Perhaps. But de Mol, chief
executive of Endemol Entertainment Holdings, is already exporting
voyeuristic game shows across Europe, and CBS will soon be
producing his most recent hit show, ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Making good on the Orwellian reference, ``Big Brother'' is a
game show based on five men and five women who are sealed for 100
days in a house where cameras and microphones record them 24 hours
a day. Every two weeks, viewers vote to oust one of the characters.
At the end, the surviving player wins about $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, television regulators in the state of Hesse were so
offended by ``Big Brother'' that they tried to ban it last month.
They failed, and the one-hour show is now drawing about 2.5
million, or 15 percent, of viewers six nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Big Brother'' catches on with Americans, de Mol is ready to
export scores of other shows to the United States. There is ``The
Bus,'' where contestants ride cross country for 16 weeks. Or ``In
the Money,'' in which roving camera crews offer people money to do
things like sit on raw eggs and imitate a hen.
</P>
<P>
   And there is ``Now or Never,'' a pilot program de Mol has
produced with Jerry Springer, the bad boy of American talk-show
hosts. In ``Now or Never,'' which has not yet been picked up by
broadcasters, Springer plans to confront guests plagued by strange
phobias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I can look at our catalog and think of 20 or 25
formats which could work in the United States,'' de Mol said,
sitting behind his huge, delta-shaped glass desk.
</P>
<P>
   Right or wrong, Endemol Entertainment is part of an important
change in European media. Until recently, European commercial
broadcasters relied overwhelmingly on American shows _ dubbed
versions of Melrose Place, locally produced clones of ``Wheel of
Fortune'' (``Glucksrad'' in Germany) and brazen imitations of
talk-show hosts from Oprah to David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   The big reason is that most European countries didn't even begin
commercial television until 15 years ago. Before that, most
television was government-owned and taxpayer-financed _ more
educational than American television but less entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   That situation changed radically after the mid-1980s, when
governments gave licenses to for-profit broadcasters, and cable
television vastly expanded the number of channels reaching the
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, spurred by big demand for new programming, European
producers are filling more and more of the gap _ often with
astonishing results.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans have been leading the charge in voyeuristic
``reality-based'' shows. It was a British company, Celador, that
created ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' And it is another
British company, Castaway, that developed ``Survivor,'' a game show
in which contestants are dropped onto a desert island.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Endemol that has dominated the production of game
shows at the very edge of television. The was created just four
years ago when de Mol merged his television company with that of
Joop van Ende, a well-known Dutch theater and television producer.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the two men set their sights on creating
programs that could easily be cloned for the rest of Europe. They
also started buying smaller production companies in France,
Portugal, Spain, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Endemol produces nearly 400 separate television
``formats,'' seizing on game shows and other reality-based programs
as the easiest to export. In 1999, Endemol's sales reached 963
million Dutch gilders (about $414 million) and they are expected to
top 1 billion Dutch gliders this year.
</P>
<P>
   But it was ``Big Brother,'' started in the Netherlands last
year, that really put Endemol on the map. Though it sounds like a
knock-off of shows like MTV's ``Real World,'' de Mol took pains to
give it added edge.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After carefully selecting attractive young people in their 20s
and early 30s, the producers look for ways to promote tension and
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants have no idea what viewers think of them, but
viewers can log their preferences on the show's Web site and check
each person's popularity ratings at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants are also given ``assignments,'' like chopping
wood to keep a fire going for 24 hours. But the main source of
tension, besides being recorded on camera at all times, is that the
contestants have to vote for throwing each other out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Though the show was a smash hit in the Netherlands and is
currently attracting about 15 percent of the audience at 8 p.m. in
Germany, critics say the show is often dull.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the highlight of the show last Monday came when a
mechanic named Zladko, who had been recommended to leave, angrily
accused the other contestants of ganging up on him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such dullness, the show has mesmerized the media and
many young viewers in both Holland and Germany. When the first
contest reached its final vote in Holland on Dec. 30, one-quarter
of the population tuned in to watch.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, where the first contest began one month ago, ``Big
Brother'' attracted a torrent of advance publicity and ethical
debate. When a contestant named Despina voluntarily quit the show
after the first week, she became front-page news in Bild, the
country's biggest-circulation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My explanation is that our everyday life has become very
boring and non-dramatic,'' said Jens Jessen, chief culture editor
of Die Zeit, the much-respected German newsweekly. ``People are
missing the real life in their lives, so they want a substitute
life.''
</P>
<P>
   A 23-year-old student near Dortmund, who was bounced from ``Big
Brother'' on the first vote, said he had not been burdened by the
loss of his privacy. But the student, Thomas, who is prohibited
from giving his last name until the current contest is over,
predicted that the show was in real danger of becoming boring once
the novelty wore off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be more of these kinds of shows in
Germany,'' he said. ``But I don't know how far you can take it. You
will have to change the concept, make it more interesting. So
they've now thought up the idea of chaining people together and
that in my opinion is at the boundary of shamelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   De Mol is not worried. Last month, thanks in large part to ``Big
Brother,'' the Spanish telephone company Telefonica reached a deal
to acquire Endemol Entertainment for approximately $5 billion in
Telefonica stock.
</P>
<P>
   De Mol will turn over his job as chief executive officer, but
remain in charge of developing new programs. And he clearly has not
exhausted all the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer the question that has been asked 100,000 times,
which is `where are the limits and how far are you going?' '' he
said. ``You can't give a general answer to that. You have to take
it on a case-by-case basis.''

AIR-SERVICE WOES CONTINUE TO PLAGUE PASSENGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite airlines' efforts to stall congressional attempts to
mandate better passenger treatment by announcing improvements in
customer service, the nation's major air carriers saw consumer
complaints increase 130 percent last year, according to an annual
survey by university researchers.
</P>
<P>
   And, given the demand for air travel and the limited capacity in
airport terminals, on runways, and in airplanes, things are likely
to get worse, according to an author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal performance by airlines in 1999 comes after increased
anger by passengers over shoddy treatment _ exemplified by
passengers being stuck for hours on snowbound Northwest Airlines
aircraft in Detroit. That anger resulted in calls by politicians
for passenger protections and a concerted effort by the airlines to
improve service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continued declining industry performance quality in 1999 gives
cause for Congress to again seriously consider the passage of an
Airline Passengers' Bill of Rights,'' wrote Dean Headley and Brent
Bowen, coauthors of the study conducted annually since 1991 by the
Wichita State University business school and and the Aviation
Institute at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. ``Many consumers
believe that the airlines have not delivered on promises to
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the poor service, airlines are enjoying profitable
times, even with dramatic increases in fuel prices. Airlines are
reporting near record loads, with planes being more than 70 percent
full on average.
</P>
<P>
   Those heavy loads are expected to continue _ demand is
forecasted by the federal government to increase by more than 3
percent a year. System capacity remains constrained, which means
things will get much worse before they get better, Headley said in
a telephone interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is scary when you look at the increase in demand versus the
lack of capacity. The bottom-line picture is that it will be five
years at least before there are new runways that can change
capacity,'' Headley said. ``By the time we get to that point, it is
entirely possible that every day at the airport will look like the
Wednesday before Thanksgiving. And what will that do to customer
complaints and attitudes? It will get a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual study ranks carriers based on customer complaints to
the Department of Transportation and uses federal statistics for
on-time arrivals, lost baggage complaints, and the number of
passengers bumped from flights because of overbookings. It ranked
Southwest Airlines as the best of the 10 major airlines.
Continental finished second, followed by Delta, Northwest, and
Alaska Airlines. US Airways, which held the top spot in 1998,
dropped to sixth, followed by American, America West, TWA and
United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The only area in which the industry improved from 1998 to 1999
was mishandled baggage. The number of complaints was down to 5.08
per 1,000 passengers from 5.16 per 1,000 passengers in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On-time arrivals declined to 76.1 percent in 1999 from 77.2
percent the previous year and involuntary denied boardings
increased slightly to 0.88 per 10,000 passengers. Consumer
complaints increased from 1.08 per 100,000 passengers to 2.48 per
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Air Transport Association, which worked with
the airlines to develop improved customer service pledges that went
into effect in December, was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The study also chided the airlines for ``many anti-consumer
oriented rules developed recently to enhance perceived productivity
at the expense of consumer comfort'' that have led to increased
complaints. Among the new rules cited are strict limits to carry-on
bags, limiting pre-boarding to children, and not allowing consumers
to take earlier connecting flights when seats are available.
</P>
<P>
   The study says the airlines are not solely to blame and that the
Federal Aviation Administration needs to do more to improve the
national airspace system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not expediting the implementation of GPS navigation and
approaches, free-flight, ground incursion management, data-link and
other enhancements to handling increased capacity in a constrained
system will soon have a direct and noticeable deteriorating effect
on consumers' attitudes and confidence in the use of airline
services,'' the study says.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA spokesman said the language in this year's report is
``virtually identical to what they said in 1999 and they overlooked
some of the tremendous strides we made in the last year.'' New
computers have been installed in the nation's 21 en route centers
and new display systems are being installed as well.

CMGI TO OFFER `POINTS' TO WEB SITE VISITORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those frequent-user points you're used to racking up with
airlines and credit cards are coming at you on the Internet, too.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI Inc., the Andover, Mass. venture investment firm, is
launching a ``CMGI points'' program, so that online visitors to its
many sites can earn travel and gifts, through an alliance with
Netcentives Inc. CMGI said it would acquire 4.9 percent of San
Francisco-based Netcentives's shares as part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Netcentives shares jumped 16 percent to $27.25, while CMGI
shares slumped 10.5 percent in a down day for Nasdaq stocks, to
$83.9375.
</P>
<P>
   The move reflects CMGI's effort to develop loyalty among Web
users _ a challenge for all business-to-consumer Internet players.
Companies are looking for ``sticky traffic,'' or customers who will
come back regularly to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   This also marks CMGI's first effort to push its own brand. While
any of its 70 companies that choose to participate can tout their
own name on the reward program, links to sister companies will show
CMGI's name and let users build up points in the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Rewards will include airline miles, as well as thousands of
gifts, from golf clubs to jewelry. Netcentives's technology tracks
the time users spend on each site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purpose is really to help our companies get big fast,''
said Bill White, executive vice president of marketing at CMGI. He
calls rewards programs a ``natural evolution'' on the Web.
``They're very popular with influential consumers in the
traditional world.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Frankel, chief of Internet research at Adams, Harkness &AMP;
Hill, a Boston investment banking firm, said such plans are likely
to help build brand loyalty. He notes that iwon.com (not a CMGI
company) is drawing traffic by offering lotteries worth thousands
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In CMGI's case, he said, ``Here's a way to earn points without
spending money. You can get something for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   CMGI's AltaVista search engine will be the first unit to employ
the points program, next month. Netcentives said clients for its
``click rewards'' program include America Online, American Express,
barnesandnoble.com, and Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   The recent shakeup in Internet stocks has awakened investors'
concerns about how companies that depend on Web traffic will fare.
Roughly half of CMGI's investments are in b-to-c companies, which
sell to consumers instead of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   White said CMGI is still a big believer in b-to-c.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aim to let our companies demonstrate their success relative
to their competitors,'' he said. No gimmick can replace top
technology and services, White said. But ``they do help provide
retention, and they are an incentive to get somebody to try
something new.''

FOR THE RED SOX, A HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ New century. New season. New paint on the old park. New
center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Same old hope.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday is the 100th home opener for the Boston Red Sox.
(itals)One hundred.(unitals) That's one for every bottle of beer on
the wall, one for every point scored by Wilt Chamberlain in
Hershey, Pa., in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's first American League home opener was played at the
Huntington Avenue Grounds (corner of Huntington and Rogers
Avenues), and Cy Young beat Connie Mack's Athletics, 12-4, in front
of 11,500 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-eight years ago, five days after the Titanic sank in the
North Atlantic, the Red Sox opened their new park with a 7-6
victory over the New York Highlanders in front of 27,000 fans.
Bleacher seats cost 25 cents and John F. Kennedy's grandfather
threw out the ceremonial first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Weather permitting, Ramon Martinez will throw the first pitch of
the 2000 Fenway season Tuesday to Minnesota Twin Todd Walker, and
35,000 fans will fill the ballyard that's been home to the Red Sox
since Woodrow Wilson was president.
</P>
<P>
   Olde Fenway, state-of-the-art in 1912, has become
state-of-the-heart, a crumbling edifice slated for demolition
sometime this decade. The Red Sox play their home games in the
oldest park in the major leagues, and the rickety joint has been
home to more sorrow than success since the last World Series winner
played here in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Red Sox of great expectations started their season with
a limp 2-4 road trip through Seattle and Anaheim, but that won't
dampen the spirits of thousands of Boston baseball fans who once
again are absolutely convinced that . . . this is the year.
</P>
<P>
   The cover of Sports Illustrated's baseball preview said the Red
Sox will win the World Series. Sage Larry King is similarly on
record, as is half the population of Red Sox Nation. Some of these
expectations are based on fact and reality. Some are trendy, others
downright delusional.
</P>
<P>
   What is abundantly clear is that many New England sports fans
are counting on the Red Sox to ease the dull pain inflicted by
various Patriots, Bruins, and Celtics since the Sox closed out
their magnificent 1999 season with a playoff loss to the world
champion Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, New England needs the Red Sox to be good. The
region's ever-fragile psyche has been shaken by the buffooneries,
ineptitude, and abject underachievement of men who throw footballs,
hit slapshots, and dribble basketballs.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, Bruins, and Celtics all finished out of the
playoffs. Pete Carroll was fired, Pat Burns is likely to get the
gate, and Rick Pitino sometimes sounds as if he's losing his mind.
The Sox, often a source of ridicule and disappointment, are the
last line of defense in Boston's desperate attempt to avoid the tag
of Loserville, USA. It is an unusual position for the franchise
that virtually invented ``wait till next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox players know the situation. From the first day of spring
training, veterans Pedro Martinez, Nomar Garciaparra, John
Valentin, and Mike Stanley were reminded of the excitement the Sox
were generating back home in the frozen North. Newcomer Carl
Everett can't possibly grasp the magnitude of the mission _ he
hasn't been in Boston yet _ but it'll be painfully obvious in a
couple of hours when he takes his position in center field and gets
his first showers of praise or poison (depending on what he did in
his previous at-bat).
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is not an easy game. Tom Hanks brings home the point in
``A League of Their Own'' when he tells Geena Davis, ``If it was
easy, everybody'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true. Who among us wouldn't trade places today with
Everett, just for the chance to patrol the great green patch of
Fenway's center lawn in front of 35,000 passionate fans eager to
make comparisons to Ken Griffey or Willie Mays?
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Red Sox claim they are up to the task. There was no
overreaction when they dropped four straight to the Mariners and
Angels. Manager Jimy Williams is not given to panic. The Sox know
who they are. Assembled in the image of bloodless creator Dan
Duquette, they will not succumb to the hype, hope, or occasional
horror created by outsiders. Cheer, boo, rip, praise. It matters
not to the 25 men in the Boston clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   First pitch is at 1:05. Celebrating 100 years of major league
baseball on the landfill from Huntington to Brookline Avenue, the
cowhide-covered sphere is passed from Cy Young to Ramon Martinez.

DETROIT HOPES NEW BALLPARK IS BIG PLAYER IN CITY'S REDEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Also being filed in `s' category.) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Few cities have talked more about or waited longer for
a visible symbol of resurrection than this one, the nation's
poorest.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the patience will be rewarded on Tuesday, with the
inaugural game at Comerica Park, the new $300 million home of the
Detroit Tigers baseball team and the showpiece of a burgeoning
entertainment district in downtown Detroit. The stadium was built
with city, county, state and private money, and was named for its
corporate sponsor, Comerica Bank in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders are convinced that the ornate open-air stadium,
with its synchronized water fountains and 50-foot Ferris wheel,
will drive investment _ not to mention thousands of visitors _ back
downtown, just as Jacobs Field and Camden Yards transformed
Cleveland and Baltimore into banner cities for urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of banners, Tigers officials are quietly picking out
spots to display a World Series banner, should the
down-on-their-luck Tigers rally and bring home the championship, a
feat this 99-year-old franchise has not accomplish since 1984. And
the way the team is limping along _ at 1-5, the Tigers have the
worst record in baseball _ fans will probably wait a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've endured a lot of rhetoric over the years,'' said Denise
Illitch, the daughter of Tigers owner Mike Illitch and the
president of Olympia Development, which is handling projects
surrounding Comerica Park. The Illitch family also owns the Detroit
Red Wings hockey team, which plays at Joe Louis Arena on the city's
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this ballpark is real. It's proof things are changing,''
Ms. Illitch said.
</P>
<P>
   Change is whirling all around the ballpark. Later this week,
construction will begin on an $800 million office complex several
blocks south that will become the headquarters of Compuware Corp.,
which makes software for managing corporate networks. The company
is moving from Farmington Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Just east of the stadium, construction crews are excavating the
site of Ford Field, a brick-and-glass stadium with a dome, also
costing about $300 million, that will sit alongside Comerica Park
and bring the Detroit Lions football team back to the city for the
first time in 26 years. The Lions, who now play in the Silverdome
in suburban Pontiac, plan to open Ford Field in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 3 million people expected to visit Comerica Park
this season will not have to worry about parking or traffic.
They'll walk to the 40,000-seat ballpark. Forty-seven townhouses,
with price tags of $140,000 to $250,000 are being built across the
street, on land that for years had been used by prostitutes and
drug users
</P>
<P>
   Signs advertising loft space pop up daily in the windows of
deserted office buildings nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But most surprising is the nightlife that has crept back, now
that two of the three voter-approved casinos have opened temporary
sites on the fringe of downtown. On most evenings the parking lots
at the MGM Grand and the Motorcity Casino resemble those of
suburban shopping malls. Eventually the casinos will build near the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one here, not even the ever-jubilant Mayor Dennis
Archer, is ready to proclaim Detroit completely reborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not where we want to be,'' Archer said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Huge swaths of the city are dominated by weed-choked lots and
abandoned houses. Some basic services like street lighting and bus
service are still unreliable. That is why many Detroit residents
say they are reluctant to believe the city's renaissance will ever
extend beyond downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd that we're spending hundreds of millions of
dollars on a new ballpark when we can't keep our libraries open
regular hours and our kids don't even have safe playgrounds,'' said
Frank Rashid, a lifelong resident and founder of the Tiger Stadium
Fan Club, which pleaded with city officials to revitalize Tiger
Stadium. The famed ballpark sits empty about a mile from Comerica
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is fixated on shortcuts to revitalization,'' Rashid
said, ``the big Jesus Christ projects that do nothing but deliver
false promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban planning and economic experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is no evidence that building a new sports stadium
resurrects a downtown or a city,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, an
economics professor at Smith College. ``In cities that are
investing in several downtown projects all at once, there is
additional activity, but it's mostly from the transfer of income
and employment from surrounding communities into the downtown area.
You rarely see a great spread effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mayor contended that Comerica Park is crucial to
Detroit's comeback, if for no other reason than as an morale boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comerica Park will help restore the excitement of urban living
that has been missing far too long from downtown Detroit,'' Archer
said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Comerica Park was designed to dazzle. Life-size
stone tigers and baseball bats guard the entrances. Inside the
ballpark, children can ride a Ferris wheel with seats shaped like
baseballs or a carousel featuring 30 handpainted tigers. The
low-rise outfield stands are expected to be another attraction,
with their postcard view of the city's skyline. Along the wall in
left-center field, huge stainless steel statues of Hall of Fame
players like Hank Greenberg, Ty Cobb and Charlie Gehringer will
keep watch. And the 10-story-tall scoreboard is the largest in
baseball, the Tiger organization says.
</P>
<P>
   As it is with most things, Comerica Park's grandeur comes at a
price. Now that the team offers luxury seats, the price of an
average home game ticket has doubled to $24.83, the fourth highest
in baseball, according to Team Marketing Report.
</P>
<P>
   But even that has done little to spoil this city's excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit has lost so much and had to wait so long for something
to be proud of,'' said 63-year-old Bernard Battistelli, a longtime
Tiger fan, who typically attends 10 to 15 home games a year. ``I'd
rather pay a little extra than sit around another 10 years waiting
for a rebirth.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ It's Opening Day in Detroit, and it will be a very
bittersweet affair for those who love baseball.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Tigers will be entering the 21st century in
Comerica Park, and not beloved Tiger Stadium. Don't for one
millisecond think Boston and Chicago have cornered the market on
ballpark passion. For many people, myself included, there never was
a better pure baseball experience than spending a sunny day
ensconced in the upper deck at the Grand Old Lady at the corner of
Michigan and Trumbull.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tigers and the city of Detroit have chosen to
acknowledge the cold-blooded reality of the modern-day baseball
business. Please never forget that it is a business, and always has
been. Hence, the word ``professional.'' I loved Tiger Stadium, but
I didn't have to run a franchise there. And you may love Fenway
Park, but you don't have to run a business there, either.
</P>
<P>
   It also happens to be Opening Day here, in hallowed Fenway Park
(weather permitting, of course). It will not be the last Opening
Day played in baseball's oldest park. There will be one next year,
and the year after that and the year after that. If all goes well,
Opening Day in 2004 will find the Red Sox playing in a new
ballpark. If all goes only partially well, postpone that date by a
year. Don't even think about prolonging this necessary change any
longer than that. If there isn't a new ballpark by 2006, there more
than likely won't be any Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   This being Boston, the subject of a new ballpark is a touchy
affair. It is first necessary to demonstrate what should be obvious
to any rational sports fan; namely, that a new ballpark is
desirable. Should that be accomplished, the matter of location
becomes an issue. There is, of course, the distasteful subject of
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Boston, there is even a fourth contingency. The hardest
decision of all might be to determine just what the new ballpark
should look like.
</P>
<P>
   It is often amusing listening to some of the Fenway Park zealots
argue that time should stand still forever. They will rhapsodize
about the Good Old Days when Tom Yawkey owned the team. They have
convinced themselves that the Old Man will file some sort of
celestial class-action suit if the Red Sox dare leave Fenway for
some new edifice.
</P>
<P>
   What they almost undoubtedly don't know is that for many years
prior to his death in 1976, Yawkey pined for a new ballpark. He may
have liked to play pepper at Fenway when the team was on the road,
but he was still a businessman at heart and he was not as
emotionally attached to Fenway as these people might think.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for example, is Yawkey, as quoted in the June 24, 1967,
issue of The Sporting News: ``You ask me how I feel about the
stadium and I ask you what has changed about the stadium picture
since I left here last fall? As far as I can see, nothing has
happened. My position is the same as it was six months ago. I feel
the stadium is necessary for Boston, this state and all of New
England.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, Fenway Park, after years of benign neglect
(check out attendance figures in the '50s and early '60s), has
become some sort of certified baseball hallowed ground. Dewy-eyed
people talk about how daddy, grandpa, or Uncle Louie took him or
her to that famous First Game. OK, fine. People rhapsodize about
The Wall. Going to Fenway has become the New England baseball fan's
version of going to church. That is to say, many people don't go
because they really want to go. They go because they feel they
(itals)should go(unitals). It validates them as proper New
Englanders. Meanwhile, they show up waiting for something bad to
happen. It should be pointed out that the last time people went to
Fenway Park in good spirits was Oct. 2, 1978 _ innings one through
six. From the moment you-know-who hit the ball you-know-where,
cynicism has become the predominant outlook of people trooping into
the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Except when Pedro pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The ballpark in question has its charms, but it also happens to
be thoroughly uncomfortable, which is hardly surprising, since it
was built in 1912 for tiny people born in the 19th century. Take it
from a 6-foot-1-inch season ticket-holder who cannot put his feet
on the ground without his knees smacking up firmly against the seat
in front of him. A whopping 19 percent of the seats are in the
bleachers. Of the remaining 81 percent, a great many are actually
very bad seats, a figure that would include just about everything
from first base to the bleachers. Don't even talk about parking.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway being small and poorly configured, is it any wonder that
its average ticket price is the highest in the major leagues? The
franchise being so desperate for income, is it really a surprise
that management would feel forced to construct something as hideous
as the truly loathsome 600 Club, a monstrosity that both spoils the
park aesthetically and gobbles up space that could have been better
used by both (itals)real(unitals) fans and _ OK, I'll say it out
loud _ a press corps that operates from a press box that is so
useless for so many that the only logical conclusion is that it was
constructed this way out of spite?
</P>
<P>
   A new park is the only answer, and by a new park that should
mean a (itals)new park(unitals), not the old park with better aisle
space. I take it from the monster ad supplement I saw in the Sunday
paper that the Red Sox higher-ups are planning on a new park with
the same 37-foot wall. Does anyone really think that will make
people who love the original feel any better about its passing?
We're kinda gonna know that neither Jimmie Foxx nor Wade Boggs ever
hit one off the new wall, so whom are they kidding?
</P>
<P>
   This is the faux Las Vegas-style approach to ballpark
construction. If there is to be a new park, it must develop its own
character. If you want a wall, fine, have a wall. Make it high
enough to stop something, say 15 or 17 feet high. Or put up a
scoreboard wall, a la right field in Camden Yards. But constructing
another 37-foot wall is classically retrograde Boston, and totally
pathetic. We will be mocked for not knowing the difference between
history and parody, and rightfully so.
</P>
<P>
   History. Don't get me started. I love history, but this is a
town where people all too often choose to wallow in history rather
than to honor it. History is only important if it can be used as a
tool to help us manage our future. There are any number of ways we
can honor the history of Fenway Park. I welcome that discussion,
but it can wait until we move into the new blank.com Ballpark, and
the sooner the better.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China on Monday rejected the official U.S.
explanation for the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
during NATO's air war against Yugoslavia last year, and again
demanded a ``thorough and comprehensive'' investigation. But U.S.
officials declared the matter closed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for China's foreign ministry in Beijing, Zhu
Bangzao, criticized the Central Intelligence Agency's dismissal of
a mid-level officer blamed for the attack as inadequate and
reiterated China's demands that the Clinton administration ``punish
those responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   China's response indicated that its government remained deeply
suspicious of U.S. assurances that the bombing on May 7, which
killed three Chinese and wounded at least 20 others, was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect we're going to have to agree to disagree on this,''
a senior administration official said Monday, adding that there
were no plans to further investigate the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, 11 months after the bombing, the CIA dismissed
one officer and punished six others for their roles in identifying
and approving the target, which officials have said was intended to
be a military supply headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's spokesman insisted in a statement that the bombing
was ``a tragic accident,'' which officials have blamed on mistakes
made by the dismissed officer in locating the supply headquarters
on a map.
</P>
<P>
   Under Secretary of State Thomas R. Pickering notified the
Chinese ambassador to the United States of the punishment on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman disdained the
official U.S. explanation Monday. ``To pretend that the United
States did not know the position of the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia is not credible,'' Zhu said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   What officials have said was the intended target, the Federal
Directorate of Supply and Procurement, was nearly 1,000 feet from
the embassy in the New Belgrade section of the capital, and Zhu
said the two buildings did not resemble each other. ``It was
impossible for the U.S. side to mix up these two buildings,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's spokesman, James P. Rubin, responded
Monday that the investigations had been ``thorough and complete.''
He said the administration had gone to great lengths to explain to
the Chinese the circumstances leading up to the bombing, and
described the dismissal of the agency officer and the punishment of
six others as ``appropriate steps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have followed through and implemented fully our commitment
to the Chinese to brief them fully on the results,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the embassy caused grave strains in relations
between the United States and China, leading to attacks by mobs on
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and a suspension of military ties and
other contacts with U.S. diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the attack, many Chinese officials and news
reports described the strike as deliberate, but Zhu did not repeat
that assertion Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For months afterwards, Chinese officials repeatedly raised the
bombing in meetings with U.S. officials, even as the two countries
made progress on other matters, like China's planned membership in
the World Trade Organization. More recently, Chinese officials had
moderated their complaints and in some meetings did not raise the
issue at all, according to administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the United States agreed to pay $28 million to
compensate China for the damage caused to the building. It had
previously agreed to pay $4.5 million to the families of those who
were killed. In return, China agreed to pay $2.8 million for damage
to the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zhu said that the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade had ``unmistakable
markings'' that should have prevented its bombing. He expressed
disbelief at U.S. assertions that reviews after the target was
picked failed to detect the mapping error U.S. officials have
described.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said the targeting error was not detected
during numerous reviews because military databases used during the
war did not note the current location of the Chinese Embassy, which
moved from its old location in central Belgrade more than four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's sharply worded criticism from China reflected the anger
still lingering over the attack. Defense and administration
officials in Washington say the Chinese position appears intended
in part for domestic consumption in China, but they also say the
bombing has deeply wounded Chinese pride.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, the Chinese spokesman, alluded to that Monday when he said
the attack ``greatly hurt the dignity of the Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an extremely serious international unlawful act,'' he
said.

DETROIT HOPES NEW BALLPARK IS BIG PLAYER IN CITY'S REDEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Also being filed in `a' category.) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Few cities have talked more about or waited longer for
a visible symbol of resurrection than this one, the nation's
poorest.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the patience will be rewarded on Tuesday, with the
inaugural game at Comerica Park, the new $300 million home of the
Detroit Tigers baseball team and the showpiece of a burgeoning
entertainment district in downtown Detroit. The stadium was built
with city, county, state and private money, and was named for its
corporate sponsor, Comerica Bank in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders are convinced that the ornate open-air stadium,
with its synchronized water fountains and 50-foot Ferris wheel,
will drive investment _ not to mention thousands of visitors _ back
downtown, just as Jacobs Field and Camden Yards transformed
Cleveland and Baltimore into banner cities for urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of banners, Tigers officials are quietly picking out
spots to display a World Series banner, should the
down-on-their-luck Tigers rally and bring home the championship, a
feat this 99-year-old franchise has not accomplish since 1984. And
the way the team is limping along _ at 1-5, the Tigers have the
worst record in baseball _ fans will probably wait a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've endured a lot of rhetoric over the years,'' said Denise
Illitch, the daughter of Tigers owner Mike Illitch and the
president of Olympia Development, which is handling projects
surrounding Comerica Park. The Illitch family also owns the Detroit
Red Wings hockey team, which plays at Joe Louis Arena on the city's
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this ballpark is real. It's proof things are changing,''
Ms. Illitch said.
</P>
<P>
   Change is whirling all around the ballpark. Later this week,
construction will begin on an $800 million office complex several
blocks south that will become the headquarters of Compuware Corp.,
which makes software for managing corporate networks. The company
is moving from Farmington Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Just east of the stadium, construction crews are excavating the
site of Ford Field, a brick-and-glass stadium with a dome, also
costing about $300 million, that will sit alongside Comerica Park
and bring the Detroit Lions football team back to the city for the
first time in 26 years. The Lions, who now play in the Silverdome
in suburban Pontiac, plan to open Ford Field in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 3 million people expected to visit Comerica Park
this season will not have to worry about parking or traffic.
They'll walk to the 40,000-seat ballpark. Forty-seven townhouses,
with price tags of $140,000 to $250,000 are being built across the
street, on land that for years had been used by prostitutes and
drug users
</P>
<P>
   Signs advertising loft space pop up daily in the windows of
deserted office buildings nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But most surprising is the nightlife that has crept back, now
that two of the three voter-approved casinos have opened temporary
sites on the fringe of downtown. On most evenings the parking lots
at the MGM Grand and the Motorcity Casino resemble those of
suburban shopping malls. Eventually the casinos will build near the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one here, not even the ever-jubilant Mayor Dennis
Archer, is ready to proclaim Detroit completely reborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not where we want to be,'' Archer said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Huge swaths of the city are dominated by weed-choked lots and
abandoned houses. Some basic services like street lighting and bus
service are still unreliable. That is why many Detroit residents
say they are reluctant to believe the city's renaissance will ever
extend beyond downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd that we're spending hundreds of millions of
dollars on a new ballpark when we can't keep our libraries open
regular hours and our kids don't even have safe playgrounds,'' said
Frank Rashid, a lifelong resident and founder of the Tiger Stadium
Fan Club, which pleaded with city officials to revitalize Tiger
Stadium. The famed ballpark sits empty about a mile from Comerica
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is fixated on shortcuts to revitalization,'' Rashid
said, ``the big Jesus Christ projects that do nothing but deliver
false promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban planning and economic experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is no evidence that building a new sports stadium
resurrects a downtown or a city,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, an
economics professor at Smith College. ``In cities that are
investing in several downtown projects all at once, there is
additional activity, but it's mostly from the transfer of income
and employment from surrounding communities into the downtown area.
You rarely see a great spread effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mayor contended that Comerica Park is crucial to
Detroit's comeback, if for no other reason than as an morale boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comerica Park will help restore the excitement of urban living
that has been missing far too long from downtown Detroit,'' Archer
said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Comerica Park was designed to dazzle. Life-size
stone tigers and baseball bats guard the entrances. Inside the
ballpark, children can ride a Ferris wheel with seats shaped like
baseballs or a carousel featuring 30 handpainted tigers. The
low-rise outfield stands are expected to be another attraction,
with their postcard view of the city's skyline. Along the wall in
left-center field, huge stainless steel statues of Hall of Fame
players like Hank Greenberg, Ty Cobb and Charlie Gehringer will
keep watch. And the 10-story-tall scoreboard is the largest in
baseball, the Tiger organization says.
</P>
<P>
   As it is with most things, Comerica Park's grandeur comes at a
price. Now that the team offers luxury seats, the price of an
average home game ticket has doubled to $24.83, the fourth highest
in baseball, according to Team Marketing Report.
</P>
<P>
   But even that has done little to spoil this city's excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit has lost so much and had to wait so long for something
to be proud of,'' said 63-year-old Bernard Battistelli, a longtime
Tiger fan, who typically attends 10 to 15 home games a year. ``I'd
rather pay a little extra than sit around another 10 years waiting
for a rebirth.''

   &QL;  RIO GRANDE: SEVENTH MOST ENDANGERED RIVER
</P>
<P>
   By Alison Vekshin
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, April 10 -- Excessive water consumption and
over-engineering of riverbed habitat threaten the Rio Grande, which
ranked seventh among the nation's 13 most endangered rivers,
according to a survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   American Rivers, a national, non-profit conservation group,
ranked the rivers based on their serious and immediate
environmental degradation. It cited research published in
Conservation Biology, a scientific journal, that shows animals
living in the nation's rivers and streams are dying at a rate five
times faster than animals living on land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dams, dikes, ditching and draining have altered our rivers to
such an extent that today in America our native fish are homeless
in most parts of the country,'' said Rebecca Wodder, the group's
president. ``These days, if you're a fish, a river is a dangerous
place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1,960-mile Rio Grande, the nation's fifth longest river, has
been experiencing uncontrolled growth. Diversions for irrigation
have drained so much water that some sections have been left
completely dry, the report said. Combined with diversions for
municipal use, they claim almost 95 percent of the Rio Grande's
average annual flow.
</P>
<P>
   Other threats to the Rio Grande include flood control, land
development and pollution, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio Grande last made the group's endangered list in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds ironic but the river needs more water,'' said Steve
Harris, executive director at Rio Grande Restoration.
</P>
<P>
   He said El Paso's and Albuquerque's plans to divert more water
from the river will make the river go dry more often for longer
periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   Best Metcalf, U.S. director of the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo Basin
Coalition, said the Rio Grande Valley's population is burgeoning
and is relying on the river's water.
</P>
<P>
   Fluctuation in water flow is the river's main problem, said
Daniel Malanchuk, chief of the El Paso regulatory office of the
Albuquerque Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's a problem that it's a border river between two
nations with different sets of laws.'' The report found that in
general, dams, levees and stabilized riverbanks have destroyed
river habitat and are contributing to the extinction of native fish
and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   At least 123 North American freshwater species have become
extinct since the beginning of the 20th century, said Anthony
Ricciardi of Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The group has been issuing an annual list of endangered rivers
for 15 years. The Lower Snake River, which flows through
Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Wyoming, ranked first on the list.
The Missouri River, which spans from Montana to Missouri, ranked
second.

EXILES SEEK `MIRACLE' TO KEEP BOY FROM GOING BACK TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Even as relatives caring for Elian Gonzalez met Monday
with a team of government psychiatrists to determine the best way
to hand the boy over to his father, the struggle to keep him with
them continued in court and on the streets of Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   With a mid-evening prayer vigil planned near the house Elian now
calls home, many in the Cuban exile community held out hope that
another ``miracle'' would occur -- a reference to Elian's survival
and Thanksgiving Day rescue off the south Florida coast. Still, a
reunion between father and son appeared imminent, the demonstrators
conceded for the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment, it looks like it's all over,'' said Yohanny
Martin, 25, a salesman who has made almost daily pilgrimmages to
the house. ``But it's not all over. That wouldn't be justice for
Elian, who has to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, reversed himself Monday
and said he would travel to Miami to pick up his son under certain
conditions, among them a neutral location for the transfer. Miami
Police Department spokesman Angel Calzadilla reiterated that
officers would keep the peace outside the house but would not enter
it to help federal officials remove Elian.
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney General Janet Reno has been adamant in her efforts
to reunite Elian with his father, who arrived in Washington last
week with his second wife and their infant son. The only unresolved
issues, according to federal officials, are when, where and how the
reunion will occur.
</P>
<P>
   The mayors of Miami and Miami-Dade County, both Cuban-Americans,
planned to meet with Reno Tuesday in Washington to ask for a 30-day
transfer of custody, a delay they said would give Elian time to
adjust to leaving the American family he has come to know for the
Cuban one that has claimed him from the start. Miami Mayor Jose
Carollo noted that Elian was already ``snatched'' from one mother,
when she drowned enroute to Miami, and that it would be unhealthy
to take him suddenly from the young cousin to whom he has become
attached.
</P>
<P>
   That cousin, 21-year-old Marisleysis Gonzalez, remained
hospitalized Monday for exhaustion. At the family's request, their
meeting with two government psychiatrists, a psychologist and
officials with the Immigration and Naturalization Service was moved
from another location to the hospital where she is being treated.
Neither side had any comment after the session.
</P>
<P>
   James McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, had his own meeting
planned with Juan Miguel Gonzalez, along with the congressman's
wife, Lisa, and their toddler son. They carried a gift with them
for Gonzalez's 6-month-old boy: a little brush and comb set with
the US Capitol pictured on the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to tell you, I'm watching this guy on TV and my heart
aches for him,'' McGovern said. ``I couldn't imagine having my son
pulled away from me. I don't think I could bear it. It's probably
something I appreciate more now that I'm a father. I don't know
what I would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying his long-term interest was in normalizing relations with
Cuba, McGovern added that he hopes President Clinton will do
something before leaving office that no other president has done:
``Look at the right wing Cuban exile community and say `No.' This
craziness has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, however, the family was not yet taking no for an
answer Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives, led by Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, met
by minutes the deadline to formally appeal the federal court ruling
that gave Reno the right to return Elian to his father in Cuba. A
court hearing is scheduled for May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the family's last-ditch efforts appeared unlikely to
pan out. Although she issued no ruling and set a hearing date for
next week, Circuit Court Judge Jennifer D. Bailey said the
relatives' appeal for custody seems to have little legal merit and
that they have shown little evidence that returning Elian to his
father would harm the child.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the house in Little Havana, however, protesters remained
firm in their conviction that returning Elian to a communist
country would not only be harmful but immoral. Few are predicting
violence anymore, and the smaller-than-usual crowd Monday afternoon
was calm if a bit downcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a certain element of bluff, the threats and the
warnings to do things that would be more self-destructive than
anything else. . .,'' said Max Castro, a University of Miami
political science professor who favors returning Elian to his
father, even if it means the child will grow up in Cuba. ``They
realized to a certain degree that they were shooting themselves in
the foot, so they figured, 'Let's stand down on this one.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With a rush-hour traffic slowdown at Miami International Airport
scrubbed last Friday, Cuban demonstrators were still vowing to form
a human chain to stop federal officials from removing Elian from
his great-uncle's home. But they continued to insist they would
welcome the father, whose stated desire to return to Cuba, they
said, is simply the communist line he has been fed by Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father says what Fidel wants him to say,'' said Alfredo
Latour, 64, who worked for a Spanish-language magazine publisher
before he retired. ``Nobody wants to live in Cuba. Everyone wants
to leave, but they can't. And if he wants to stay there, well it
doesn't make any sense.''

   EUROPE-SHOCK-TV (Hilversum, the Netherlands) _ Oprah Winfrey
dropped out of shock television long ago. Maury Povich migrated
from audience shoutfests to the million-dollar-quiz biz. Even Fox
TV was shaken enough by the fallout from ``Who Wants to Marry a
Millionaire?'' to quash a plan to crash a jet into the desert for
prime time entertainment. But the European producer John de Mol is
serenely undeterred. Witness his latest brainstorm, ``Chains of
Love,'' a post-millenial evolution of ``The Dating Game'' in which
contestants compete for a date while chained together for up to
five days in handcuffs and ankle irons. By Edmund L. Andrews. (1375

   ZIMBABWE-LAND (Chegutu, Zimbabwe) _ About 4,500 white farmers
own more than half of Zimbabwe's fertile farms, including more than
2 million acres of fallow land that Western donors agree could be
better used by peasant farmers. But despite repeated threats over
the past 20 years, the government has never seized any property
without paying for it, land experts and commercial farmers say. By

   RUSSIA-ARMS (Moscow) _ In the first major test of a new and more
centrist parliamentary majority in Russia, President-elect Vladimir
Putin reached agreement Monday with his legislative allies to bring
a long-delayed nuclear arms reduction treaty to a ratification vote
in parliament as early as Friday. Proponents of ratifying the
treaty, known as START II, predicted Monday that they have the
votes to win. The decision to move forward immediately with the
vote in the wake of Putin's victory in last month's presidential
election was hailed as a significant advance of the arms control
agenda here, one that had been blocked for five years by a
Communist-led coalition that dominated the parliament. By Patrick
E. Tyler. (1000 words)

<P>
   CHINA-NEIGHBORHOODS (Shenyang, China) _ For urban Chinese who
are middle-aged and beyond, the old ``neighborhood committees''
that watched over every household are among the more obnoxious
memories of the early decades of Communist rule. Staffed, as lore
has it, by one's nosiest neighbors, the committees were empowered
to scrutinize every visitor, report every antisocial activity and
even monitor pregnancies. On the more positive side, they also
sorted out neighborly disputes, watched out for burglars or fallen
power lines, and sometimes even ran convenient food shops. Over the
last 20 years, with the decline of Marxist fervor and the emergence
of a more diverse society, the committees waned but they never
quite disappeared. Now, with experiments here and 19 other cities,
the government is trying to reinvent this venerable institution,
replacing the legendary ``seven grannies with eight teeth between
them'' with more professional, somewhat younger staffs that can
link up citizens up with vital social services. By Erik Eckholm.

   DISABLED-STUDENTS (Undated) _ Mark Breimhorst cannot take tests
the way other students do: He has no hands. So when he was applying
to business schools in 1998, Breimhorst received permission from
the Educational Testing Service to take the Graduate Management
Admissions Test on a computer with a trackball, and was given 25
percent more time to accommodate his disability. Under the
longstanding policy of the testing service, his results were mailed
out with the notation, ``Scores Obtained Under Special
Conditions.'' Breimhorst, a 29-year-old graduate of Stanford
University, was not admitted to business school. Now, in a federal
lawsuit that could affect hundreds of thousands of students with
disabilities, he is challenging the way the testing service flags
the scores of students who use accommodations to take the exams.
The lawsuit asserts that such flagging is a kind of scarlet letter.

   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush insists he has made no
list yet, and Vice President Al Gore only last week initiated a
formal process to study the backgrounds of dozens of possible
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   They may be taking their time, but the rest of the political
world isn't. Since the only mystery left about the Republican and
Democratic presidential tickets is the identity of the running
mates, the national game of ``who'' is already in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor Gore has the luxury of an easy pick _ an
obvious party star who would automatically be everyone's first
choice. The two most prominent potential candidates have
emphatically ruled themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain would bring political punch,
personality and foreign policy credibility to a Bush ticket. But
the governor prefers a veep ``who likes me.'' Any such latent
sentiment between the two surely died in the nasty South Carolina
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Colin Powell's bipartisan popularity rests in part
on his resistance to political activism. Although McCain, if
properly wooed, might change his mind, Powell never would. His wife
Alma is known to fear that as the first black candidate on a
national ticket, he might be killed.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Democrats who have similar broad party-expanding
appeal. House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt comes closest, but
his current role is pivotal in the Democratic campaign to regain
control of the House. He is more important to the party right where
he is.
</P>
<P>
   So the usual suspects are governors and members of Congress who
might balance the ticket by being helpful in key states or among
certain ethnic, generational or religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the first rule of veepdom is to be seen and not
heard, like a juvenile, and to never hurt the ticket. This rule,
however, has not always worked out well in practice.
</P>
<P>
   The most frivolous modern pick was Barry Goldwater's choice of a
snappy wordsmith, Rep. William Miller of New York in 1964 because
``he will drive (President) Lyndon (Johnson) nuts.'' Miller did
nothing of the sort, instead spending the campaign playing cards
with his traveling entourage.
</P>
<P>
   The most comfortable pick was George Bush the elder's 1988
selection of Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana because he liked the
younger man and saw him as non-threatening. But Quayle was a
political disaster, from his limp military record to his dismal
debate performance with his Democratic counterpart, the much
smarter Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The boldest was former Vice President Walter Mondale's 1984
choice of Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New York, a pioneering act of
gender bravery driven by Mondale's grim assessment of how badly he
trailed President Reagan. But while Mondale cleared the candidate's
background for scandal he failed to look into that of her spouse.
The financial messes involving Ferraro's husband were discovered
too late.
</P>
<P>
   In the past a typical approach was simply to embrace a defeated
rival in hopes of uniting the party. Thus Ronald Reagan took George
Bush, Michael Dukakis took Bentsen and Bob Dole took Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   Geographical balance led Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson to pick
Sen. John Sparkman of Alabama, John F. Kennedy to pick Sen. Johnson
of Texas and Richard Nixon to take Maryland Gov. Spiro Agnew.
</P>
<P>
   But that theory evaporated with Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's
1992 selection of Sen. Al Gore from neighboring Tennessee. The
pairing clicked so well that geography is now merely one of many
factors to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the veep is supposed to bring an alternate ideology to
the ticket to reassure voters that the nominee is not unacceptably
hard-line about the issues he campaigns on. This tactic does not
work well since vice presidents are not independent entities.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge is currently a prospect for
Bush's short list because he is a Catholic from a big northeastern
state who is pro-choice and might soften Bush's anti-abortion
image. New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, also pro-choice, is
similarly attractive if Bush decides not to give up on the
Northeast, his weakest region.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ferraro did nothing to save Mondale (no male could
have either), the notion of a female vice president is still alive.
But women do not necessarily vote for other women. They did not go
for Elizabeth Dole, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore recently appointed former Secretary of State Warren
Christopher to examine the personal stories and financial records
of hordes of prospects. People who don't feel like cooperating get
dropped _ as well they should.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates should not be confronted with unpleasant
surprises, as George McGovern was in 1972. His running mate, Sen.
Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, turned out to have had electric-shock
treatments for depression that he had failed to mention.
</P>
<P>
   It is more exciting to speculate that Bush and Gore will try to
do something adventuresome than to resign ourselves to the idea of
boring partners who offer more of the same. Why shouldn't Bush pick
his brother Jeb, governor of Florida, a state he needs to carry?
Bush-Bush would create certain dynasty problems. But what the heck,
the Kennedys have managed it.
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't Gore select Secretary of Defense William Cohen, a
former Republican senator so moderate that Democrats love him? He
even writes poetry.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is imagination and a little courage, fellows.

FAMED EXPLORERS SAY MUCH LEFT TO BE DISCOVERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the Hubbard dining room at the National
Geographic Society Monday, seven of the world's most famous
explorers discussed the weighty topic of whether the age of global
exploration was over.
</P>
<P>
   Far from it, they said.
</P>
<P>
   To prove their point, the seven, who were named as the National
Geographic's first members of an Explorers-in-Residence program,
described what they wanted to go after.
</P>
<P>
   Their answers revealed a world of the unknown, even in this age
of discovery that has physically reached some of the ends of the
earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be studying and reconstructing the earliest and most
primitive dinosaur this year in Argentina,'' said paleontologist
Paul Sereno, who noted that half of all dinosaurs discovered were
found in the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   After Argentina, Sereno will take a three-month trek into the
Sahara Desert, digging up other dinosaur fossils.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Goodall, the leading authority on chimpanzees after 40
years of study, will push for saving the rapidly dwindling species,
especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as
Zaire. Archeologist Johan Reinhard will explore higher-altitude
Andean Mountain burial sites for preserved mummies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will go back to the Black Sea and look for evidence of
human habitation from the legend of the biblical flood,'' said
ocean explorer Robert D. Ballard, president of the Institute for
Exploration in Mystic, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologist Wade Davis, who received his doctorate in
ethnobotany from Harvard University, plans to walk from the Chumbi
Valley to Rongbuk monastery in the Himalayas to explore the makeup
of distant cultures. Stephen Ambrose, author and historian, hopes
to help restore parts of the Lewis and Clark trail.
</P>
<P>
   And marine biologist Sylvia Earle will study marine sanctuaries
off Florida's Keys and California's Channel Islands and Monterey
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't know what's out there,'' Earle said. ``Less
than 5 percent of the deep sea has been seen at all.''
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic hopes its explorer program will promote
conservation and scientific learning. The explorers were chosen to
take part for several years, spending much of the time in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in history that we have the ability to
do widespread irreparable harm to the environment,'' said Terry
Garcia, vice president for mission programs at National Geographic,
standing under a portrait of the society's founder, long-bearded
Gardiner Greene Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we also have the chance in using the advanced
communications to draw attention to the sustainability of the
planet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The explorers stressed how much remained unknown, saying the
perceptions that there was little left in the physical world to
uncover was wrong. In short comments, several made references to
the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The universe below is the greatest frontier ever,'' said
author Ambrose. ``Except maybe botany, and all the plants yet to be
discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodall said new uses of DNA would lead to many discoveries
among chimpanzees and other animals.
</P>
<P>
   And she made another point: Discoveries can be made any time, as
any child knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 4 1/2 years old, no one would tell me where eggs
came from. So I sat in a henhouse for several hours,'' she said.
``Finally when I saw a hen lay an egg, it was exciting to me as,
Eureka!''

<P>
   CNS-GAY-CEREMONY (New York) Supporters of same-sex marriage have
battled in states across the nation to enjoy the same rights as
married heterosexual couples. Now they're taking the fight to
Washington, D.C. On April 29, as many as 5,000 gay and lesbian
couples will participate in a mass wedding outside the Internal
Revenue Service headquarters in the nation's capital. By Stephen
Parker. (900 words)

</P>
<P>
   CNS-GAY-COMMITMENT (New York) _ Gay and lesbian couples have
been fighting for years to have their relationships legalized in
the same way that heterosexual marriages are. But the lack of legal
sanction hasn't stopped many couples -- or some religious groups --
from taking the plunge. By Stephen Parker. (675 words)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-JEWS-IN-JERUSALEM _ Although most Jews in Jerusalem consider
themselves ``religious,'' many do not agree with the Orthodox laws
that govern the city, like the shuttering of stores and restaurants
on the Sabbath. And the objections of these Jews is joining the
voices of the Christians and Muslims who also consider Jerusalem a
holy place but want more secular representation. By Maya
Dollarhide. (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-LOWRENT-BROKER (New York) _ Real estate prices in New York
are notoriously high, so imagine the plight of those with limited
incomes who are searching for an affordable place to live. Enter
Linda Stephens, a broker who finds housing for them, and lowers her
own income to do so. By Natalie Leston. (950 words)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-TATTOO-ARTISTS (New York) _ Getting tattoos isn't the only
thing catching on. Giving them is on the upswing too, with classes
offering budding artists the opportunity to try out a new canvas.
But that worries some traditional tattoo artists, who fear an
eroding of the apprentice system. By Jocelyn Anderson. (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-CHILDREN'S-BOOK-BAN (New York) _ The latest adventure of
``Captain Underpants,'' a mild-mannered school principal who
becomes a battling superhero, has been banned from a Connecticut
elementary school. Officials said the popular book by Dav Pilkin,
``Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of Professor
Poopypants,'' is tasteless. By Kate Dawson. (950 words)

   CNS-AIDS-GRANDMOTHERS (New York) _ The golden years of some
grandparents have become tarnished by the prospect of raising their
grandchildren who have been orphaned or abandoned by parents with
AIDS. By Andrea McDaniels. (1200 words) (Photo is available at

</P>
<P>
   CNS-FEAR-OF-CLOWNS (New York) _ It's no laughing matter, but
some people are afraid of clowns. Maybe it was a childhood
encounter or some other trauma. Regardless, they go out of their
way to avoid seeing those painted faces. By Michael Goldman. (925

   CNS-GAY-CEREMONY (New York) Supporters of same-sex marriage have
battled in states across the nation to enjoy the same rights as
married heterosexual couples. Now they're taking the fight to
Washington, D.C. On April 29, as many as 5,000 gay and lesbian

<P>
   CNS-GAY-COMMITMENT (New York) _ Gay and lesbian couples have
been fighting for years to have their relationships legalized in
the same way that heterosexual marriages are. But the lack of legal
sanction hasn't stopped many couples -- or some religious groups --
from taking the plunge. By Stephen Parker. (675 words)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-JEWS-IN-JERUSALEM _ Although most Jews in Jerusalem consider
themselves ``religious,'' many do not agree with the Orthodox laws
that govern the city, like the shuttering of stores and restaurants
on the Sabbath. And the objections of these Jews is joining the
voices of the Christians and Muslims who also consider Jerusalem a
holy place but want more secular representation. By Maya
Dollarhide. (900 words)

<P>
   CNS-LOWRENT-BROKER (New York) _ Real estate prices in New York
are notoriously high, so imagine the plight of those with limited
incomes who are searching for an affordable place to live. Enter

own income to do so. By Natalie Leston. (950 words)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-TATTOO-ARTISTS (New York) _ Getting tattoos isn't the only
thing catching on. Giving them is on the upswing too, with classes

<P>
   CNS-CHILDREN'S-BOOK-BAN (New York) _ The latest adventure of
``Captain Underpants,'' a mild-mannered school principal who

Poopypants,'' is tasteless. By Kate Dawson. (950 words)

   NEW YORK _ Supporters of same-sex marriage have battled in
states across the nation to enjoy the same rights as married
heterosexual couples. Now they're taking the fight to Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   On April 29, as many as 5,000 gay and lesbian couples will
participate in a mass wedding outside the Internal Revenue Service
headquarters in the nation's capital. The location was chosen to
protest the denial of tax benefits for gay and lesbian couples,
says the Rev. Elder Troy Perry, founder and moderator of the
Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches, who
organized the event and will conduct the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Those planning the nonsectarian wedding expect it will be the
world's largest demonstration celebrating same-gender unions. It is
planned in connection with the April 30 Millennium March on
Washington for Equality, which is expected to draw hundreds of
thousands of participants to the National Mall in support of civil
rights protections for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding and demonstration are the most recent and most
visible events in the struggle for same-gender marriage, a fight
that's been waged for nearly a decade. No state legally recognizes
marriage between same-sex couples, but the wedding planners say now
is the time to rally against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the last minority group you can hate in public and still
get away with it,'' says Perry, who founded his church as a place
in which Christians could worship and be openly gay. ``It's
important to share in these elections what we want from government
and what we're striving for.'' The movement now has 314 churches
and about 52,000 active members, Perry says.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government and 34 states now have laws known as
``defense of marriage acts,'' which restrict marriage to
heterosexual couples. Similar legislation is pending in 10 more
states, according to the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a
gay and lesbian advocacy group based in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the right to marry, gay and lesbian couples seek
other spousal benefits, including the right to qualify for shared
health-insurance benefits, to file joint tax returns, to visit
partners in the hospital and make medical decisions for them in
emergencies, and to inherit each other's property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religious right says we don't settle down, we're
promiscuous,'' says the Rev. Elder Nori Rost of the Pikes Peak
Metropolitan Community Church. ``But when we want to encourage
long-term relationships, they say, `Absolutely no way.'''
</P>
<P>
   The movement to legalize same-sex marriages won a short-lived
victory in 1993 when the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that denial of
the freedom to marry is discrimination. But the court recently said
its decision was rendered moot in 1998, when voters passed a
constitutional amendment allowing the Hawaii Legislature to
restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples. In a conciliatory move,
the state has passed a ``reciprocal beneficiaries'' law, giving the
broadest rights and benefits ever accorded to gay and lesbian
couples in the United States, according to Lambda.
</P>
<P>
   Gay-marriage supporters lost another major battle in California
last month as voters approved Proposition 22, which excludes legal
recognition of same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The latest fight is over a ``civil unions'' bill approved by the
Vermont House of Representatives and pending in the state Senate
that would give same-sex couples the same rights and benefits as
married heterosexual couples, with one notable exception _ the
right to legally marry.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment ceremony falls on the same day as a Texas
couple's 45th anniversary. The Rev. Ralph Lasher, 72, and his
partner, Harry Gibson, 79, will renew their vows in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've served as a role model for people,'' Lasher says of his
longtime relationship with Gibson. ``They constantly strive and use
us as an example that it can happen. It's important to let people
see we can be serious about relationships _ it's not all about
one-night stands.''
</P>
<P>
   But another couple, Richard, 53, and Tony, 58, will speak about
the discrimination they have faced as a gay couple. (Because of
Tony's uncertain immigration status, they asked that their last
names be withheld.) The couple obtained a marriage license in 1975
from a Boulder, Colo., city clerk who claimed it was legal for gay
men to marry. Tony, an Australian immigrant, applied for residency
as Richard's spouse, but an Immigration and Naturalization Service
official denied the request in a typed response, stating, ``You
have failed to establish that a bona fide marital relationship can
exist between two faggots.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd also will hear from Rev. Jimmy Creech, 55, a former
United Methodist minister from Raleigh, N.C., whose credentials
were removed because he performed a holy-union ceremony for two gay
men in April 1999. Creech has a wife and three children but has
taken up the fight for legal same-sex unions because, he says, to
deny them is purely bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are relationships that deserves honor, acceptance and
support by society,'' Creech says. ``Marriage is not based on
gender; it's based on love and commitment. To define it purely on
biological terms is to distort the whole understanding of
marriage.''  &QL;

 GAY COUPLES FIND A PLACE AT THE ALTAR

   NEW YORK _ Nori Rost still remembers the day she admired her
best friend's white wedding gown and watched family and friends
gather around the bride and groom. She couldn't stop crying and
repeatedly left the reception line to pull herself together. As a
lesbian, Ross realized she could not have a picture-perfect wedding
of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Rost never did get married. But she has performed up to 100
commitment ceremonies for gay and lesbian couples during 10 years
as pastor of the Pikes Peak Metropolitan Community Church in
Colorado Springs, Colo. These ceremonies are church weddings that
aren't recognized as legal marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbians has been fighting for years to gain the freedom
to legally marry. They have encountered many setbacks, including a
conservative Christian effort to protect traditional marriage.
Thirty-four states have passed laws excluding legal recognition for
gay and lesbian spouses, but Rost argues same-sex marriage would in
no way threaten traditional marriage between a man and woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if there is only a limited number of marriage
certificates to give out, and gay and lesbian couples would take
them,'' Rost says.
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian couples know they may have a long fight ahead
before they gain the entitlements of legally sanctioned marriages.
But thousands have taken the plunge anyway, exchanging vows and
rings in churches throughout the nation. According to the National
Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute, a number of sects
perform commitment ceremonies. Among them: the Universal Fellowship
of Metropolitan Community Churches _ which was founded specifically
as a place for gay and lesbian Christians to worship _ Unitarians
and Universalists, United Church of Christ, Quakers and independent
Jewish synagogues. The Central Conference of American Rabbis,
representing the Reform movement, said in March that Reform rabbis
who decided to officiate at same-sex ceremonies would have its
support.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Community Church of New York has performed
hundreds of commitment ceremonies. ``This is not about rights,''
says the Rev. Pat Bumgardner. ``The ceremony is a recognition of
the holy nature of their love and its value. There is something
legitimating about doing that in a church before God.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Krueger, 38, and Linda Randolph, 48, of Larkspur, Colo.,
walked down separate aisles in their holy-union ceremony. Both wore
chiffon, knee-length white dresses, and exchanged vows and rings.
The women will celebrate their 10-year anniversary in November, and
they say the ceremony helped their love grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more and more in love with each other every day,''
Krueger says. ``We have found a deepening of our relationship. Even
though there have been tough times, we've come through them being
stronger on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Many committed gay and lesbian couples raise children _ from
former heterosexual spouses, artificial insemination or adoption.
Roughly half of the hundreds of New York couples united in
Metropolitan Community Church ceremonies raise children, Bumgardner
says.
</P>
<P>
   Don Campbell, a 60-year-old graphics designer from Colorado
Springs, Colo., divorced his wife 14 years ago, but he says he has
a great relationship with his son and daughters. His partner, Tom
Simpleman, is a 51-year-old pharmacist who is also divorced with
children. In their June 1998 commitment ceremony, their sons were
the best men, and the daughters, ``I guess you call them
groomsmaids,'' Campbell says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're honest about who we are, and people see we're normal
people who happen to love somebody who's the same sex we are, the
more accepted we're going to be,'' Campbell says.  &QL;

JEWS IN JERUSALEM: THE GREAT DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II's recent visit to Jerusalem
refocused the world's attention on the centuries-old conflict among
Christians, Jews and Muslims over the city each considers to be its
Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerusalem is also the site of another conflict _ lesser
known to some in the outside world _ that is equally emotional and
divisive. It pits the city's ultra-Orthodox community, which rules
Jerusalem, against Conservative, Reform and secular Jews.
</P>
<P>
   At the very core of this conflict is the sensitive debate of
what it means to be a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   There are roughly 200,000 Jews living in Jerusalem today.
Eighty-five percent of them would consider themselves ``religious''
and 60 percent would be considered secular or non-Orthodox Jews,
according to Rabbi Michael Paley, an Orthodox American rabbi, who
has lived and worked in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Orthodox Jews are not recognized in Israel by the
ultra-Orthodox community. Yet they must live by laws created by the
Orthodoxy in Government. For example, the city keeps the Sabbath,
even if all its inhabitants do not. Public transportation and most
businesses and restaurants, are closed Friday evening until the sun
sets on Saturday. In addition, the work and school week start on
Sundays for the Jewish community. Only the Muslim and Christian
schools are open on Saturdays. The simple difference in the school
week makes it difficult for children of the various religions to
mix.
</P>
<P>
   But the most controversial aspect of the Orthodox versus the
other Jewish groups is the inability of Conservative and Reform
rabbis to perform weddings or help with divorce proceedings.
Throughout Israel, only Orthodox rabbis have the power to do these
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem for the Reform and Conservative movements
in Israel is that they represent only a handful of neighborhoods
and seats in the government,'' Paley said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem is getting crowded. New businesses open up daily next
to sacred sites, and tourists can go from McDonald's to the Western
Wall in 10 minutes. The secular and the religious worlds that are
jockeying for position live in side-by-side tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secular world and the religious world live side by side,
but they do not mix,'' said Paley.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I lived in Jerusalem,'' said Abby Beshkin, 27, a former
Hebrew University student, ``it was hard for me to convince people
that my political views leaned towards the left, but that I was
still Orthodox and religious.'' While Beshkin kept the Sabbath, she
also believed that public transportation should be available for
those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews in Jerusalem say they observe the Sabbath only because
it is strictly enforced in the city. In the ultra-Orthodox
neighborhoods, men will sometimes throw stones at cars they see on
the road. ``Sabbath!'' they shout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is open on Friday nights,'' said Deborah Doft, 27,
also a former Hebrew University student. ``I had friends who would
drive into Tel Aviv because there is more going on there. There are
bars and cafes open on Fridays. But not in Jerusalem, except maybe
a few in the Arab quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   David Erlick is a self-proclaimed secular Jew living in
Jerusalem. Although Erlick does not always celebrate the Sabbath,
he closes down his successful cafe on Friday nights. ``No one would
come anyway,'' he said. When they were younger, Erlick and secular
friends used to break all of the Sabbath rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have barbecue with pork and watch television,'' he
said. ``It would really upset my more conservative-minded
neighbors.'' Erlick said more happens on Fridays in Tel Aviv and
Beshkin agreed, ``Public transportation doesn't run in Tel Aviv,
but you see more cars on the road and more clubs are open,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tel Aviv is considered to be the most secular city in Israel.
``The religious live in Jerusalem,'' Paley said. `` The secular _
they like Tel Aviv.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, these issues have to do with a civil society,
reconciling a Jewish State to a state containing many citizens,''
said Stuart Shoffman, a senior editor for the Jerusalem Report.
``It's tricky and technological.'' Shoffman believes that everyone,
including the Muslim and Christian people living in Israel, must
have equal living situations in order for the city to run at its
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of the city doesn't fall into the ultra-Orthodox
community. There is a large spectrum,'' he said. ``The secular and
the religious Jewish education, everything is divided.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Reuven Hammer, a Conservative rabbi, said bitterly at a
panel discussion in Jerusalem last month, ``This is the only
country in the free world where Jews are denied basic religious
freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   But as dialogue between the groups starts to happen, many are
optimistic that the religious and secular communities can be woven
together into the fabric of Israeli life, especially in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in Israel,'' said Schoffman. `` I have to believe
things will get better.''

THIS REAL-ESTATE BROKER SPECIALIZES IN LOW-RENT APARTMENTS FOR THE
POOR

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not a day goes by that Linda Stephens doesn't
remember how, three years ago, she and her three children were
evicted from their Bronx apartment. Stephens was in the middle of a
second divorce, her salon business was going under, and the family
had to go on welfare for several months. After living with friends
and relatives for six months, she finally found a new apartment she
could afford.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after moving into her own apartment, Stephens got
her real-estate license and found an apartment for a woman who had
also been evicted. That led to more calls and referrals and, soon,
she had her own business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed to be my calling,'' Stephens said.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when rents in New York City are skyrocketing, it is
especially difficult for low-income working residents to find an
affordable place to live. The Census Bureau says the average
monthly rent for an apartment in the city's five boroughs increased
37 percent from 1991 to 1999, from $475 to $648. But those figures
also include rent-regulated apartments, and do not as accurately
reflect current market conditions. Some studio apartments go for as
much as $1,850 a month, and rents for larger apartments are
significantly higher. For a person with a job paying minimum wage
or not much more, it can be difficult to find an affordable
apartment, and a real-estate agent who is willing to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous lack of affordable housing in New York
City right now that is safe and suitable,'' said Joshua Goldfein, a
lawyer at the Legal Aid Society's Homeless Rights Project, which
represents the homeless and helps them find work.
</P>
<P>
   Goldfein said that the amount of government-subsidized housing
had fallen sharply in recent years as a result of cuts in financing
for low-income housing. And many city-owned residential buildings
have been sold to private owners.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens works with about 20 to 30 individuals or families each
month, most of which she says are ``quite desperate.'' They have
been displaced from their homes for a variety of reasons, including
losing their jobs, getting divorced, suffering domestic abuse, or
being HIV positive. Many are living in shelters or with relatives
in overcrowded conditions. Since starting her business, Stephens
says, she has worked with about 200 low-income individuals and
families.
</P>
<P>
   To find her apartments for her clients, Stephens calls landlords
she has contacts with, mostly in the Bronx and Manhattan. She has
learned, she said, which landlords have the cleanest and most
affordable apartments. Rents for the apartments she takes clients
to see start at $550 for a one-bedroom, $650 for a two-bedroom and
$750 for a three-bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens works out of her Morris Park apartment in the Bronx,
which she says allows her to save on office rent as well as spend
more time with her children, who are 15, 17 and 20. While most
real-estate brokers charge a fee of as much as 15 percent of annual
rent as commission, Stephens charges one month's rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most real-estate brokers it's about the money, not about
the people,'' she said. ``For me it's a personal issue to help as
many people as I can and also be able to help my family.'' Stephens
said she earns enough to provide for her family _ she wouldn't say
how much _ but that they have few luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   About half her referrals, Stephens said, come from city agencies
that deal with the homeless or from private nonprofit groups like
the Coalition for the Homeless. If she cannot help potential
clients, she will direct them to appropriate agencies or groups for
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes broker's fees are so ridiculous that we stop using
them,'' said Donna James, the program director for the Coalition
for the Homeless' Rental Assistance Program. ``But with Linda
Stephens, it works both ways. She refers people to us, and we
sometimes call her when we need an apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   When agencies are involved, however, the process can be lengthy.
If a landlord has a vacancy, and there is an agency to help pay the
rent, it's a ``win-win situation,'' Stephens said. But it can take
weeks or even months for a landlord to get a check, and many are
unwilling to hold an apartment until they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tennis match, back and forth, until you finally
get the keys and a lease,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens said she constantly lives with cash flow problems as
she waits for her own checks from clients. But she said she looks
into a potential client's background and resources before taking
them on so she has always been paid her fee except in one or two
instances.
</P>
<P>
   Her job, however, does not necessarily end after she has found
an apartment for a client, or even after the person has moved in.
Often with low-rent apartments, there are heat or electrical
problems and, sometimes, a family simply cannot afford the rent
after they have moved in. In cases like these, Stephens often acts
as an arbitrator to help find a solution.
</P>
<P>

said. ``I'm a person, so I take the client's problems too

five boroughs of New York and, in the next couple of years, to
start her own nonprofit group to help low-income residents.

TATTOO CLASSES OFFER STUDENTS A NEW WAY TO BECOME ARTISTS 
</HEADLINE>

School of Journalism at Columbia University.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bryan Bogle pulled up his gray trouser leg to reveal
an abstract geometric symbol, jet black ink against his light skin.
Instructor Bruce Kaplan, his long, dark hair secured by a leather
headband, nodded approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad,'' Kaplan said. ``Next time, you should to put the
needle in deeper and not leave it as long. It will look smoother.''
At long last, Bogle had successfully tattooed something other than
a practice grapefruit at home.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle is a student at Sacred Tattoo shop in lower Manhattan,
where Kaplan had given him five lessons in the art of creating
permanent designs by piercing the skin with ink-injecting needles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practicing on fruit is completely different from skin,'' says
Bogle, a 21-year-old art student who wears his dark hair short with
sideburns. His skin is peppered with seven tattoos, including a
particularly intricate spider web woven across his left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straight lines are the hardest,'' Bogle says, especially since
tattooing is done with an oversize needle that is attached to a
power box and a cord. ``I'm used to paintbrushes. Here you've got
such a heavy machine, it's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogle, like others who find their way to Kaplan's Canal Street
shop, is looking to perfect a skill that has become increasingly
popular. Once the province of sailors, today's body art is sported
by everyone from co-eds to cowboys. But even as tattoos have
proliferated, instruction studios are somewhat rare. The
traditional way to enter the profession is through apprenticeship
with a tattoo artist for a year or more, a method many
traditionalists still say is the best way to true artistry. Despite
such naysayers, Kaplan says he is improving the profession by
ensuring that would-be tattoo artists get the proper training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are clueless,'' Kaplan said, noting that many young
people are purchasing the elaborate electric tattoo needles but
lack the knowledge to use them. ``We sell them the equipment, so
why not sell them the knowledge?''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's lessons, at $100 each, cover use of the electric
needle, which Sacred Tattoo also sells, techniques of sterilization
and safety, and viewing sessions in which the student watches him
give different types of tattoos to customers. Then, students go off
to practice on their own on grapefruits.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 or so students Kaplan has trained in his first year of
teaching have come from varied backgrounds and have included women
learning to apply permanent eyeliner and physicians who use
tattooing techniques in plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of students at Kaplan's studio does not meet with the
approval of other practitioners. In an industry where many artists
say the techniques have been kept a secret for decades, some
consider the mass teaching approach a weakening of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bakaty, the owner of Fineline Tattoo on Manhattan's Lower
East Side, doubts that quick introductions to tattooing without
practice under the watchful eye of an expert can produce skilled
artists. Bakaty says each shop should develop a sense of cohesion:
the practitioners in his shop, for example, are mostly people who
have trained under him for long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   Tattoo artistry was recognized as an official profession in New
York City two years ago when the Department of Health decided to
require practitioners to be licensed. Department of Health records
list 509 licensed artists, said Eric Giebelhaus, spokesman for the
agency. Each plunks down $25 to take an exam on sterilization and
$100 for a license.
</P>
<P>
   But this system makes it too easy to enter such a technically
demanding field in the opinion of Carlo Fodera, owner of Technical
Tattoo supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible because you learn from a little textbook,'' said
Fodera. ``You're learning sterilization, but you're not learning
the technical aspects of applying ink to skin. Tattooing is just as
technical as it is artistic. You have to know how many layers of
skin to penetrate or you can give a really bad tattoo.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, bad tattoos from less experienced artists
have some benefits for established artists, said Chester Oswalt, a
tattoo artist for Sunset Strip Tattoo in Los Angeles. The novice
competition actually brings him more customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get more tattoo artists, these cowboys with equipment out
there,'' said Oswalt who has been tattooing for 11 years. ``But
then they mess up, and the people have to come to me to get it
fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Bogle is not worried. As music by Bob Dylan played on the
stereo system in Sacred Tattoo, Bogle leaned back and braced for
the pain of the needle. His arm was already covered with a
``sleeve'' of tattoos. He had come to Kaplan to extend the pattern
to his chest. Someday, he said, he will be on other side of the
needle_giving tattoos to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I got my first tattoo I was fascinated with it,'' said
Bogle. ``If I could tattoo in my house for a while or get a job
right away I'd be happy. I'd like to work in a tattoo shop even if
I'm not tattooing.''  &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: As part of my job I handle customer
complaints. Sometimes the callers are very upset, and I have not
had any formal training in how to deal with them. Can you give me
some pointers? F.G.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The best way to handle a complaint as a rule, is to
follow the Golden Rule. How do you like to be treated when you are
not satisfied with a particular product or service? One of the most
effective ways to communicate with an extremely upset customer is
to listen to his or her opening salvo and respond with, You're
absolutely right. Once there's nothing to argue about, the floor is
open for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to let the caller speak his or her mind, as this
venting process can also help calm him or her down. If apologies
are warranted, provide them. The next step is to try to seek a
mutually acceptable solution. However, much of this depends upon
the issue at hand and the company's policies in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the company, there is no excuse for its failure to
provide you with training in customer relations. And, stepping back
further, it sounds like the company needs to look carefully at the
number, focus, and magnitude of the customer complaints and
consider making some changes regarding the factors that are causing
these complaints in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Customer complaints are an excellent source of feedback. They
should be logged, tracked, and used as a guide for areas that need
improvement. When a company ignores messages from the marketplace,
the marketplace may soon ignore messages from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our manager gives us no recognition when we meet or surpass
our goals, whether as individuals or as a team. She is more likely
to focus negatively on some minor point or ignore our success
altogether. Should we say something to her? T.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Managers who fail to recognize the importance of recognition
are failing at one of the core elements of effective management.
Recognition has been consistently found to help improve employee
motivation, morale, learning, and self-esteem. And, it's probably
the most affordable motivator in the world.
</P>
<P>
   There can be any number of reasons for your manager's lack of
positive feedback, including insecurity, insensitivity, jealousy,
and incompetence. It may be helpful to tell her that you would
appreciate some thanks, credit, and recognition when merited by
your performance, and be sure that she understands the benefits to
the department and to her for providing them. If you then see her
improving in this area, you should give her some recognition for
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   You should also mention that you would like to have your
successes on the various projects noted in your file. If she is not
providing you with recognition for your accomplishments, she is
probably not documenting them either. When there are decisions to
be made about increases and promotions, at least your file will
give you some of the support and recognition that you deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a new subordinate in training who interrupts me and
asks questions about the very thing that, had she waited, would
have been explained to her. When I am speaking with other
employees, she will interrupt. I have tried talking over her, but
she speaks louder and louder and will not stop. When I am quietly
working, she will blurt out statements to me from across the room.
Help! D.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Having a card-carrying interrupter in the workplace can
interrupt more than conversations. A good deal of time can be
wasted explaining and reexplaining information to this person, and
the interruptions can cause frustration, aggravation, and tension
for you, and your staff, all of which can lead to interruptions in
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Since this person is in training, it is time to try some
training. Although her tendency to interrupt is most likely deeply
ingrained in her personality, you may be able to have an impact on
this behavior. You should have a review session with her, and be
sure to ask her if there are any areas in which she feels she needs
to improve.
</P>
<P>
   If she brings up the interruptions, that can be an excellent
sign. If she does not then you should. Give her specific situations
where she interrupted you or others, and let her know about the
problems that ensued as a result. Ask her if there are any steps
that she can commit to take in order to do more listening and less
interrupting in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If you see any improvement in this area, be sure to praise her
on the spot. However, if her interruptions continue, you are going
to need to ask yourself how much longer you want her to continue.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not even the children's book superhero ``Captain
Underpants'' could win a battle against the Naugatuck, Conn.,
school district.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Maple Hill elementary school have yanked Dav
Pilkey's latest book, ``Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of
Professor Poopypants,'' out of its library, saying that its humor
is tasteless and that the book has caused students to be
disruptive. While anti-censorship groups say they have not heard of
other bans of Pilkey's books, they say they regularly receive
complaints about children's books for taste and other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the newly published Captain Underpants book, the central
characters are two young troublemakers, George and Harold, who
attend the Jerold Horowitz Elementary School in the fictional
country of New Switzerland (just southeast of Greenland). Everyone
has a silly name, even the president: the Honorable Chuckles
Jingleberry McMonkeyburger Jr. With a magical ring, the boys
transform their principal into the superhero Captain Underpants.
His nemesis is Professor Poopypants, who requires everyone to take
whacky names based on their initials.
</P>
<P>
   Naugatuck's school superintendent, Dr. Alice Carolan, said
fourth-grade boys who read the book were making up and using
unflattering names for students and teachers, like Stinky and
Smelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book was beginning to take on a life of its own,'' Carolan
said.
</P>
<P>
   So the school's principal, Rebecca Sciacca, removed the two
copies of the book, the fourth in a series, from the library. Those
were the only Captain Underpants books the school had, but
officials said students brought in copies of others, including
``Captain Underpants and the Attack of the Talking Toilets'' and
``Captain Underpants and the Invasion of the Incredible Naughty
Cafeteria Ladies from Outer Space.'' The other Captain Underpants
book, the first, is ``The Adventures of Captain Underpants.''
</P>
<P>
   Sciacca would not comment about her decision, saying only that
she encourages good literature in the school. Carolan has vowed to
keep the book out of the library unless parents go to the school
board and request its return. Neither the school board nor the
Parent Teacher Association would comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Captain Underpants'' is not the only children's book to have
caused controversy in schools in the past couple of years. In some
school districts, parents have tried to ban J.K. Rowling's ``Harry
Potter'' series of adventure books. The three ``Harry Potter''
books, about a 10-year-old wizard-in-training who lives with cruel
foster parents who don't believe in wizards, have been on the New
York Times best seller list for months. The director Steven
Spielberg said he plans to make a ``Harry Potter'' movie. But some
parents give the series a failing grade, claiming the books are too
dark and violent for children and teach anti-Christian values.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy over books is nothing news, of course. ``Little Red
Riding Hood,'' Shel Silverstein's ``The Giving Tree,'' Mark Twain's
``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' and ``The Lorax'' by Dr.
Seuss are just a few children's books banned by schools across the
nation in the past. In recent years, concerns ranging from racist
language to the teaching of satanism have been raised about books
for young people.
</P>
<P>
   Education experts said Naugatuck school officials could have
turned the ``Captain Underpants'' situation into a learning
opportunity. ``These students are experiencing taboo language for
the first time, and this could be a good book for a great
discussion,'' said John Mayher, a professor of education at New
York University. He pointed out that the moral of the ``Professor
Poopypants'' book is that name-calling is hurtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would bring it into the classroom and talk about the issues
with the kids,'' Mayher said.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist in early development education, Angela Jagger,
agreed. ``This happens often with school districts,'' said Jagger,
an education professor at New York University. ``They make the
decisions when the parents should be choosing what their children
read, or they should at least not have the option taken away from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Council of Teachers of English said
they have heard every complaint in the book about literature. ``One
woman called up and complained that a book used the word `shut up'
in it,'' said Charles Suhor, the group's field director. ``She
wanted it banned from her school because she said her family didn't
use words like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Becker, associate director of the American Library
Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom, said most school
libraries have policies on selecting books for their shelves. ``A
review panel should be the ones making a banning decision, not one
official,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The NCTE began offering online complaint forms in November. ``We
have a section people can fill out to file complaints about
books,'' Suhor said. ``We reach such a huge audience because of the
Internet, I can't even keep up with all the phone calls and
e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the teachers group and the library association said the
number of protests about books remained steady from the 1960's,
when realism exploded in children's literature, until 1996. ``Once
the Internet kicked into full gear, censors were more concerned
about Web sites than hard books,'' Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   The protests reached a peak in 1995 with 740 complaints, then
dropped off 100 calls the next year and have dropped steadily ever
since. ``Teachers began self-censoring books so they wouldn't get
in trouble,'' he said, ``and conservatives began pushing to elect
school board members with their values, rather than going after
individual books.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, ``Captain Underpants'' is not flying in Maple Hill's
library. Pilkey, 32, would not comment on the silencing of his
superhero in Connecticut. But a publicist for the award-winning
author and illustrator said he does not plan to put down his pen
anytime soon. Pilkey's next book? ``Captain Underpants and the
Wrath of the Wicked Wedgie Woman _ Watch Your Back!''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ These were supposed to be Celia Benedith's golden
years. But instead of relaxing and going out with her friends, the
East Harlem woman spends her evenings helping her grandchildren do
their homework, cooking them dinner and corralling them to bed. At
53, Benedith is doing motherhood all over again. But it's out of
necessity, not choice.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an easy life. Her daughter died of AIDS a year ago,
leaving Benedith, who is diabetic, with three young children to
raise on $800 a month in Social Security and disability checks.
Sure, she has had to make sacrifices, she says, as she goes to help
Yaumera, 9, and Jaime, 6, quiet down their 2-year-old sister,
Barbara. ``But I love my grandchildren. Of course I am going to
take care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Benedith is one of more than 12,000 grandparents, most of them
women, in New York City who are raising their grandchildren because
their own children died of AIDS. Not only are most of them past the
age at which they can chase children around, but they are often on
their own and poor, advocates say. New York has the highest number
of so-called AIDS orphans in the country _ about 35,000, or 50
percent of the national total. To compare, Washington, D.C., has
1,400, according to researchers at the Orphan Project, a research
group that is part of the United Hospital Fund in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing new for grandparents to raise children. But these
women must deal with unique stresses _ dealing with questions about
death and AIDS and worrying if the kids have HIV themselves. That's
on top of the usual difficulties that foster grandparents face,
such as putting up three to four children in small apartments on a
limited income, dealing with their own health concerns and facing
the generation gap.
</P>
<P>
   These grandparents ``have taken on a heroic task,'' says Barbara
Draimin, executive director of the Family Center, a nonprofit
organization that helps women with terminal illnesses plan for
their children's futures. ``Often they put the welfare of the kids
before their own. These women are juggling so many things in their
lives and there aren't enough services to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   This AIDS grandparent phenomenon rides on an upswing the past
few years in the numbers of women diagnosed as having HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS. Back in 1988, women constituted 16.6
percent of with HIV diagnoses in New York City. Over the next
decade, that number almost doubled, to 30.6 percent, largely
because of a resurgence of intravenous drug use, according to the
city's Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to choosing who will care for children after their
mothers have died, grandparents are preferred over strangers. Aunts
and other younger relatives often have their own children to
handle. Fathers are often dead, in prison or only peripherally
involved in their children's lives because of drug use, advocates
say. Even though these men have legal rights to custody of their
children, they are often not interested in taking care of siblings
who have different fathers.
</P>
<P>
   So the task falls into the laps of the grandmothers. It is not
an easy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets really rough'' for the grandparents, says Mircia
Sanchez, an AIDS counselor who worked with Benedith's daughter.
``They're dealing with a lot of anger. A lot of these kids are all
over the place. Their energy is different. There are cultural
clashes and economic issues.'' The young ones don't understand why
their mothers died and the older ones are aware of the stigma of
AIDS and fear they'll get sick, too.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Santana says her grandchildren were traumatized by the
deaths of their mother and father from AIDS a decade ago. One
granddaughter tried to slit her wrists to ``join her mother'' in
death and later became pregnant. Another granddaughter became a
drug addict and the grandson became so violent he was placed in
foster care. ``I'm exhausted,'' says Santana, 67, who attends one
of 30 support groups in New York City that help grandparents who
are raising their grandchildren. ``At the beginning, when they were
little, it was fine. Just when they became teen-agers it became
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   She got help from relatives, school counselors, and the support
group in dealing with the children. She put the violent grandson in
a foster home, and took him back after he straightened out. The
drug-addicted granddaughter also cleaned up, with the help of
counselors. The pregnant granddaughter has had a rougher time. She
moved in with her boyfriend _ but he sometimes abuses her, Santana
says.
</P>
<P>
   At one of their weekly meetings at an elementary school in upper
Manhattan, a dozen Hispanic women debated such issues as how to get
their Americanized grandchildren to respect their old-country
values and whether absent fathers have legitimate custody rights.
They talk about where to find benefits and how to maintain their
own health while caring for their grandchildren's illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   After Aida Marriott's daughter died of AIDS in 1993, she would
often find herself staying up until 1 a.m. washing the two babies'
dresses and preparing their food for the next day. ``I had many
problems,'' she says. ``I was working full time at a nursing home
and raising a 3- and a 4-year-old on my own,'' says Marriott, 70.
She often passed up buying herself a new outfit or going out to
dinner with a friend to be able to pay for her granddaughters'
dance lessons or tutoring. ``I wanted them to have everything,''
she says. ``In life, there are always sacrifices. Because it was
for them, I didn't feel it so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these grandmothers are on the poverty line. What's more,
their situation often puts them in a legal quandary. While the
daughter is dying, the grandmother usually meets with a social
service worker and a lawyer to go over her options. She can become
a guardian, which means the mother maintains rights to the children
while she's alive and the custody decision is ultimately in the
hands of a judge. The grandmother can be named in the daughter's
will as the caretaker of her children. She can also become a foster
parent under the auspices of the Department of Social Services,
which will provide her with financial assistance. Or she can adopt
the children _ the least popular option, because she loses
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   After the daughter dies, the grandmother can no longer count on
rent assistance and other benefits allotted to people with AIDS. If
the grandmother's name isn't on her daughter's lease, she will have
to accommodate the children in her own already-small apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing systematic about it,'' says Draimin. ``There's
no funding stream for them. Nitty gritty things do not occur
without a lot of legal and social-work intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Benedith, she says she's the right person to raise her
grandchildren, whatever the cost. ``When my daughter was alive, the
children would visit on weekends and we'd bake cakes, fun things
like that. They were more obedient to me than their own mother.
I've always been like a parent to them.''  &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Capt. Beverly Pinckney of the Department of
Correction unlocked a door to the new steel storage cage &UR; , &LR; 
rummaged through a metal file cabinet and pulled out an aged copy
of the Rikers Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one of the magazines put out by some of our inmates,''
she said, thumbing through the publication produced at the Rikers
Island prison compound.
</P>
<P>
   She  &UR;  &LR; turned to a couple of filing cabinets and pulled open the
brown drawers. Inside was a historical trove mothers' written pleas
to visit their babies' graves, inmates' redemption-themed short
stories and poetry, century-old handcuffs, photos of the burials of
indigents in unmarked graves.
</P>
<P>
   The collection of memorabilia and documents is part of a novel
plan for an archive to preserve a historical record about prisons
and prisoners in both the city and state of New York. The archive,
being developed by the Department of Correction, will be a
permanent repository of letters pertaining to prison business,
annual reports and inmate photos. It will include memorabilia such
as a female guard's uniform and prisoners' metal dining trays from
decades past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of the historical society is to tell the story of
those accused of breaking laws,'' said Thomas McCarthy, who, in
addition to working as the DOC spokesman, directs the archive from
a cubicle furnished with only a desk, phone and computer. McCarthy,
61, said he will focus exclusively on the project after he retires
next year. ``There's a story about the tension in society between
the part of society that wants to lose the wall, and the other part
that wants to build high walls. This struggle is a story. It is a
story that needs to be told.''
</P>
<P>
   The archive today is an unorganized collection in a closet-sized
cage at the department's academy in Queens. But McCarthy hopes one
day to turn it into a museum more accessible to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy founded the New York Correction Historical Society in
1997, winning approval and a tiny budget from the city's prison
commissioner to preserve and promote the history of New York City
and state correctional services.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the archive was opened to researchers and the
public. The ``real treasure of the collection,'' said McCarthy, is
a ledger book meticulously recording the names, birthdates and
causes of death _ ranging from smallpox to alcoholism _ of the
indigents buried in the City Cemetery, or Potter's Field, between
1872 and 1875. More than 750,000 indigents, including the stillborn
babies of the poor, are buried in the cemetery on Harts Island;
aging photographs feature expressionless Rikers Island inmates
burying the dead in pinewood coffins.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the letters in the archive are the requests of poor
mothers seeking to visit the Potter's Field graves of their
stillborns. Another letter accompanied the donation of 2,600
baseball bleacher seats from Ebbets Field in Brooklyn to the
Correction Department. Handcuffs in the collection recall the days
when large thick keys were used to lock heavy metal cuffs.
</P>
<P>
   The prison guard's uniform skirt is a recent addition to the
archive. Only last year, the prisons banned the skirt uniform,
which was difficult to wear when using gas masks that strap on the
leg during riots.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said the archival project appears to be unique among
prison systems, but is an important chronicle of the department's
history. ``We know who we are from our memory of who we were,'' he
said.

 &HT;    CLINTON, BARAK TO DISCUSS MIDEAST PEACE, MILITARY SALES TO CHINA
 &HT;    (650&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton meets Tuesday with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, hoping to press forward the slow-moving Middle
East peace process and head off Israel's planned sale of advanced
radar to China.
</P>
<P>
   With Barak and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
aiming to ink a final peace accord later this year, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton felt ``the time is right,'' to
talk face-to-face with both leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that there is a breakthrough expected,'' Lockhart
told reporters Monday. ``But there is a lot going on on this track
in the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Much is on the table, as well, regarding Israeli-China
relations. Clinton's not happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   The specific irritant is Israel's plan to sell China an advanced
Israeli-built airborne radar system mounted on a Russian aircraft.
The so-called PHALCON system, U.S. military officials fear, could
give a critical boost to China's ability to control an air attack
on neighboring Taiwan, a close U.S. partner in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen traveled to Israel last week to
try to convince Barak's government to cancel the proposed sale.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Barak would
hear more on the matter Tuesday, when he meets with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, and then with White House National
Security Adviser Samuel Berger, before an evening appointment at
the White House with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been profoundly concerned about a particular issue
related to the sale of certain aircraft systems to China,'' Rubin
told reporters. ``I don't intend to predict where and to what
extent it's discussed at any particular meeting, but I would expect
it to be discussed. ``
</P>
<P>
   Barak is scheduled to fly back to Israel on Wednesday _ a day
before he hosts Chinese President Jiang Zemin in the first-ever
visit by a Chinese head of state to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is slated to host Arafat for a White House meeting April
20.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Israeli and Palestinian officials have been meeting at
Bolling Air Force Base near Washington in recent weeks, hashing
over the details of a complex set of peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   After 50 years of enmity and war, the two sides have set a
mid-May deadline for agreeing to a blueprint for a final peace
accord. They hope to strike that final agreement by Sept. 13, if
they can settle their most difficult outstanding disputes _
including the future of Jerusalem, the question of Palestinian
statehood and the right of Palestinian refugees to return to
Israeli-controlled lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President believes that it's appropriate from time-to-time
to sit down and talk to the leaders face-to-face to try to move the
process forward,'' Lockhart said. ``And the President believes the
time is right to sit down and meet with both leaders, in the
context of this week and next week.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be Clinton's third meeting with a Mideast head of state
in a little more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton met at the White House with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, who has played a long-standing role in
helping to advance talks between Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   He met with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Geneva on March 26,
but was unable to persuade the Syrian leader to resume stalled
peace talks with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Assad responded formally to Israeli ideas Clinton
presented in Geneva. Rubin said there were ``differences,'' between
Assad's position in Geneva and views expressed in Friday's
diplomatic communique, but no breakthroughs that augured an
immediate resumption of Israeli-Syrian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint, we have not heard anything that, in our
view, could address seriously the remaining gaps,'' Rubin told
reporters. ``But we will continue to see if there are ways to
overcome the gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hosted Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa for a week of peace talks last January in Sheperdstown,
W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations broke down, however, over the nut issue of
Israel's return of the strategic Golan Heights in exchange for
security guarantees from Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is insisting that Israel agree to return the Golan Heights
_ land Israeli troops seized in the 1967 Israeli-Arab war _ in its
entirety before substantive security talks may advance.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has sought to retain some access to the Sea of Galilee _
Israel's main source of fresh water _ which is located within the
disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
   In a related issue, Israel plans to withdraw its troops from
southern Lebanon sometime in July. U.S. officials had hoped the
withdrawal would be part of a larger peace accord between Israel
and Syria _ which has close military ties with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   With talks between the two countries stalled, though, Barak has
said he intends to withdraw the troops with or without the
cooperation of Syria.

<P>
   Regina McCann works in a funeral home. But her nightmares aren't
caused by dead people. They're caused by clowns, or, as the
28-year-old mother of two explains, ``a whole bunch of clowns on
stilts of all different heights chasing my car.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, the fear of clowns, performers who strive to make
audiences laugh, might seem trivial, even funny. But to a largely
silent and unknown number of children and adults, the fear of
clowns, or coulrophobia (derived from the Greek word for limb), is
no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   McCann, a secretary who lives in Elkin, N.C., says that while
she tries to avoid clowns, if she does see one, the confrontation
causes an intense physical reaction. ``I just can't stand it,'' she
said in serious, even tones. ``I stiffen up, sweat and get
goose-bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Clowning is one of the oldest and most universal forms of
entertainment, according to Bruce Johnson, author of numerous books
on clowning, including ``Jest in Time,'' a history of the subject.
Court jesters were the first clowns, Johnson said, performing in
China and in Egypt as early as 1818 B.C. Throughout history, he
said, clowns have served a special role. ``The court jesters could
criticize the kings through their humor when the kings wouldn't
accept that criticism from anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's precisely the tendency of clowns to operate outside of
societal norms that causes some to fear them. ``They're social
outlaws,'' said Benjamin Procter, a 25-year-old art director for a
Manhattan software company who freely admits ``clowns scare the
bejesus out of me.'' ``Because they're playing this character, it's
as if they're authorized to do things ordinary people can't do.
They can pull off your toupee or jump into the audience and
generally make fun of you while suffering no consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   That clowns mask their identity also troubles Procter. ``They'll
have a smile painted across their face that has nothing to do with
their actual mouth position,'' he said. ``Clowns are people who are
hiding their identity. They can't be trusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people who fear clowns may have had had a traumatic
childhood experience, according to Ronald Doctor, a professor of
psychology at California State University, Northridge, who has
written a book on phobias. ``Kids around 2 or so,'' he said, ``are
very reactive to a familiar body with an unfamiliar face.''
</P>
<P>
   But for as many people who develop the fear that way, Doctor
said, there are as many who develop it through movies in which
clowns behave badly. Stephen King's movie ``It,'' which featured a
demented, murderous clown named Pennywise, did for clowns, Doctor
said, what ``Psycho'' did for the shower and what ``Jaws'' did for
swimming in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   As if that wasn't damaging enough, it's a matter of record that
the serial killer John Wayne Gacy liked to dress up as ``Pogo the
Clown'' and entertain at children's parties when he wasn't sexually
torturing and murdering teen-age boys.
</P>
<P>
   But to Kathryn O'Dell, executive director of International Clown
Hall of Fame, a Milwaukee organization dedicated to ``honoring and
sustaining the art of clowning,'' it's the images and fears of
clowns that are disturbing, not the clowns themselves. Children who
fear clowns, she added, ``are the same children who are afraid of
Barney, Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Butterscotch the Clown,'' who goes by the name Candy Will in
real life, believes children's fears are often exacerbated by
insensitive parents. The 46-year-old clown from San Juan
Capistrano, Calif., ``would like to beg parents not to force their
child into the arms of a clown if the child is afraid and crying.
This is where most of the phobias start.''
</P>
<P>
   Allyson Lezon, a 22-year-old clown from Salem, Conn., agreed
that children with fears should not be forced to interact with
clowns. Lezon, also known as ``Bubbles Lezagna,'' said she's able
to draw many children out, though, by acting ``as if Bubbles is
afraid of little girls and boys. After a few minutes of that,
they'll come out and try to comfort me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her strategy for scared adults: ``just back away.''
</P>
<P>
   If prevention fails, however, there's hope for a cure. Since
most coulrophobes don't see clowns on a regular basis, the need is
rare, said Jerilyn Ross, president of the Anxiety Disorders
Association of America, a Rockville, Md., organization. But Ross
warned that if, say, a clown moves in next door, a coulrophobe
might seek professional help. Treatment consists of ``challenging
negative perceptions and teaching relaxation techniques such as
different ways to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, she said, it may be necessary to put the client in a
situation with a clown. O'Dell, of the International Clown Hall of
Fame, runs a program designed expressly for that purpose. The
program, ``Put on a Happy Face,'' allows clowns and the children
and adults who fear them to meet in ``a safe space.''
</P>
<P>
   But is all the fuss over clowning around really necessary? To
Janice Kupiec, a 24-year-old legislative researcher in Arlington,
Va., who fears clowns, the answer is yes. ``Of course people think,
`Why be afraid of clowns when they are so many other things to be
afraid of that are real?' It's not something I sit around and think
about every day. But when I see a clown, I get scared.''

   SALT LAKE CITY _ With the voices inside her head ordering her to
kill, Lisa Duy walked into Doug's Shoot'n Sports here to buy a
Smith &AMP; Wesson 9-mm semiautomatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
   For Doug's, the biggest gun store in Utah, the transaction was
routine. The manager, Dave Larsen, called the Utah Bureau of
Criminal Identification to run a background check on Duy, and the
agency quickly approved the sale, having found no record of felony
convictions or mental illness. In the basement shooting range,
Larsen showed Duy, 24 and unemployed, how to hold and fire the
heavy stainless-steel gun. The only thing unusual, he thought, was
that as she left the store, headed for the bus stop outside, she
was wearing the shooting-range ear protectors he had lent her.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours after leaving Doug's, on Jan. 14, 1999, Duy,
ear protectors still in place, walked into the studios of
television station KSL a few blocks from the Mormon Temple and
began firing her new weapon. She shot more than four dozen times in
all, killing a young mother and wounding the building manager.
</P>
<P>
   What the background check had been unable to detect was that Duy
(pronounced dwee) had a long history of psychiatric problems, had
in fact been found to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and,
only a year before the check, had been committed to a mental
hospital by a judge after threatening to kill an FBI agent, an
encounter that sprang from her delusions that the station was
broadcasting information about her sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 episodes of rampage killings examined for this series
by The New York Times, none better illustrates than the case of
Lisa Duy just how difficult it can be to enforce a key provision of
the nation's fundamental gun control law. That provision prohibits
people who have been involuntarily committed to mental institutions
from buying a handgun. But laws in most states guard the privacy of
the mentally ill, and to protect them from stigma these statutes
generally bar law-enforcement agencies from access to mental health
records.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, gun background checks of people with psychiatric
problems typically fail to turn up their mental health history, a
loophole that has contributed to the wave of school and workplace
shootings of the last decade. In the 100 cases reviewed by The
Times, the vast majority of them from the last 10 years, half the
killers were people with serious mental illness, and at least eight
had been involuntarily committed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, fueled by those shootings, there is a growing debate
pitting public-safety concerns against the rights of the mentally
ill. Last month, more than a year after the Duy shooting, which was
followed by a similar one in April 1999, Utah became one of the few
states that give law-enforcement agencies mental health information
for background checks on prospective gun buyers. Connecticut acted
similarly last fall, after a state lottery employee with a history
of severe mental illness killed four of his bosses and committed
suicide in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Loophole
</P>
<P>
   The provision that bars handgun purchases by people who have
ever been involuntarily committed is more than 30 years old, dating
from adoption of the sweeping federal Gun Control Act of 1968.
These are frequently the most disturbed people, those forced into
hospitals because courts have determined that they may harm
themselves or others.
</P>
<P>
   But the provision is most often meaningless: Over the years, an
unlikely coalition of the National Rifle Association, mental health
advocates and civil liberties groups have largely blocked efforts
to permit the agencies that conduct background checks to gain
access to information about who has been committed. At the time of
her rampage, it was against the law in Utah for the court that had
committed Duy to so notify a law-enforcement agency.
</P>
<P>
   Even the FBI, which conducts background checks for the majority
of states, has mental health records only on people treated in
Veterans Affairs hospitals, plus an assortment of 41 other
individuals, among its data on some 40 million people that the
bureau now keeps for its system of national instant criminal
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   So when Duy, completing a mandatory federal handgun application,
answered no to a question asking whether she had ever been
committed, the Utah Bureau of Criminal Identification had no mental
health records in its database to catch her lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how Lisa could buy a gun,'' said her
mother, Khanh Duy, an ethnic Chinese who immigrated with the family
from Vietnam in 1980, when Lisa was a little girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lisa is a good girl,'' said Mrs. Duy, speaking in Mandarin.
``But she heard voices, and she had been in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Another case in which a person who had been involuntarily
hospitalized was able to buy a gun despite the federal law, and
went on to kill with it, was that of Gracie Verduzco, a 35-year-old
paranoid schizophrenic. Verduzco had been committed to mental
hospitals three times, by judges in both Arizona and, after
threatening President Clinton, the District of Columbia. Yet she
was able to buy a .38-caliber revolver at a pawnshop in Tucson,
Ariz., and she used it to kill one person and wound four others at
a post office there on May 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And near Atlanta, James Calvin Brady, a black man who believed a
machine had been implanted in his stomach that told him to kill
white people, walked out of the Georgia Regional Hospital, where he
had been involuntarily committed, and the same day bought a
.38-caliber revolver at a pawnshop. The next day, April 25, 1990,
he killed one person and wounded four at a shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Both Verduzco and Brady lied on their gun applications in
denying involuntary commitment, and there was no information to
catch them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between the rights of the mentally ill and the kind
of screening that would help keep guns out of their reach can be a
wrenching one.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Cottrell, executive director of the Utah branch of the
National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, an organization of families
of the disturbed, has a daughter with schizophrenia who, like Duy,
heard voices. One day the voices told her to kill her mother, as a
sacrifice to silence them. The daughter's psychiatrist called the
police, who arrested her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We family members have a real dilemma,'' Cottrell said. ``I
used to lie awake at night worrying my daughter would buy a gun and
carry out her delusions. So I think people who have been
involuntarily committed should be in the computer for gun checks.
But we have to be very careful we don't add to the stigma against
mental illness and make people afraid to seek treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a Justice Department study, about 150,000 people a
year are committed to mental institutions by court order in the
United States, where there are now perhaps 2.7 million people who
have been involuntarily committed at some point in their lives and
are therefore barred by the federal law from buying a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Few of these people commit murder, of course, and mass shootings
by the mentally ill account for only a tiny fraction of all
homicides. But, motivated by highly publicized workplace and school
shootings, the authorities in nine states, including Connecticut
and New Jersey but not New York, now give their law-enforcement
agencies some form of access to mental health records. Officials in
those states say they have been surprised at the number of
previously committed people who try to buy guns.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, for instance, 3,699 people who applied for a gun
card _ the first step in buying a handgun there _ were turned down
from 1996 to 1998 when records showed that they had been either
voluntarily or involuntarily committed within the last five years,
the legal test under Illinois law, said Tim DaRosa, deputy director
of the state police. An additional 5,585 people who were
hospitalized from 1996 to 1998 were found to already possess gun
permits, which as a result were revoked.
</P>
<P>
   But at the national level, as in most states, there has been no
comparable effort to create access to court commitment records for
gun checks. That lack of action is in stark contrast to the long
effort by gun control groups and the Clinton administration in
winning enactment of the Brady law to create databases screening
out convicted felons, who, like the involuntarily committed, were
barred by the 1968 law from handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Some gun control advocates say privately that addressing the
issue is simply too touchy a matter. They do not want to have to
fight on two flanks at once, confronting liberals who support the
rights of the mentally ill while battling conservatives who back
the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   One such advocate for the mentally ill is Michael Faenza,
president of the National Mental Health Association, who said that
despite The Times' finding that half the killers in the cases it
reviewed were suffering from serious mental illness, he was opposed
to any law that would provide records on involuntary commitments
for gun background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with mental illnesses,'' Faenza said, ``should not be
discriminated against in any way. If you did that, you would not
reduce the violence, only create more stigma.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woman
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Duy is a case study in how even a long record of psychosis,
arrest, assault, threats to kill and court-ordered hospitalization
may not be enough to stop a person from buying a gun. In Utah, no
one, not Duy's psychiatrists or her lawyers, not judges, the police
or prosecutors, knew her full story. It is this:
</P>
<P>
   Until high school, young Lisa seemed to flourish. Then, in the
10th grade, she started to hear voices telling her that other
students were spreading humiliating rumors about her sexual
proclivities.
</P>
<P>
   Late adolescence is the most common age for onset of
schizophrenia, and as Lisa got older, the voices grew more
tormenting, threatening to hurt her. She began to have trouble
focusing during conversation, unable to distinguish between what
people were actually saying to her and what the voices were telling
her.
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia, a disease that doctors believe has a strong
genetic component, had already been diagnosed in two of Lisa's
older sisters, and she began to worry that she too might be
mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, during her sophomore year at the University of Utah,
her mother finally took her to the emergency room of the university
hospital. There she reported that the voices made it hard to sleep,
caused burning in her head and had once led her to try to stab
herself in the heart to silence them, according to a later report
by a psychologist, Stephen L. Golding, included in court records in
the shooting case.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors sent her to Valley Mental Health, Utah's largest
public mental health network, where she was placed on Mellaril, an
antipsychotic drug used to treat schizophrenia, and on an
antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   As doctors later acknowledged in reports related to the
shooting, Mellaril has strong side effects, and Duy suffered from
increased agitation as well as rapid involuntary movement of her
arms and legs. Besides, the medicine did not stop the voices, and
so she often quit taking it. (Mellaril did have one virtue, notes
Cottrell of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill: It is much
cheaper than newer, more effective and less troublesome
antipsychotic drugs, and so Utah law requires that it be given to
indigent patients like Duy who require such medication.)
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 7, 1996, the police in West Valley City, a Salt Lake
suburb, got a call from a rock radio station, which said a woman
holding a stick was standing outside the studio and insisting that
a disc jockey nicknamed Steve Wonder was stalking her. Officer Mark
VanRoosendaal arrived to find Duy's face rigid with anger. Steve
Wonder, she said, had placed a camera inside her house and could
read her mind. Not only that, he followed her everywhere,
broadcasting secret information about her, and had tried to run her
off the road.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ MARTA has halted all routine maintenance on and around
its tracks for a week while investigators determine the cause of a
crash Monday that resulted in the second death this year of someone
working near a MARTA rail line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to refocus on safety and go over processes and
procedures and make certain we understand that safety begins with
us,'' said MARTA spokeswoman Dee Baker.
</P>
<P>
   A father and son were involved in Monday's deadly event at the
Lenox station in Buckhead. The father was killed and the son, who
sustained a life-threatening head injury, is being treated at Grady
Memorial Hospital, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous deadly event still under review, one MARTA
worker was killed Feb. 25 and another critically injured when a
train struck them alongside tracks near the Avondale station. The
worker who survived remains hospitalized at DeKalb Medical Center,
a hospital official said.
</P>
<P>
   George Ivey, a 17-year member of the MARTA board, said MARTA
must create ways for employees to better protect themselves when
they maintain the rail system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be something for people in the danger spot so
they will be safe,'' Ivey said. ``Whether the accident happens
because of human deficiency or some other deficiency, it has to be
corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's accident is being investigated by MARTA police and the
National Transportation Safety Board. Investigators said it is too
early to guess at the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Two MARTA workers were placed on paid administrative leave, a
typical move in serious collisions. The train operator and a worker
who controls which tracks trains use are on leave pending the
outcome of the investigation, MARTA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The tracks that trains use are determined by transit workers in
an Avondale rail center. In a system somewhat like airplane traffic
control, MARTA employees use computer-generated images and electric
switches to route trains around work areas and cut off the rails'
high-voltage electricity, which powers train motors.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are determining whether human error or mechanical
breakdown resulted in train No. 166 not being diverted around a job
site in the Lenox station.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's event, the two workers were aloft in a cherry picker
parked on the northwest corner of the rider platform. They were
repairing ceiling tiles when their vehicle was hit by a train at
about 2:25 a.m., according to MARTA's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus Spencer, 57, of Decatur, was pronounced dead at the
scene by an investigator with the Fulton County medical examiner.
Spencer's son, Columbus Spencer Jr., 30, also of Decatur, was
listed in critical condition at Grady Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The deceased's wife and daughter declined comment, speaking
through a Grady spokeswoman. A few neighbors contacted in the
Decatur apartment complex shared by the father and son said they
did not know the men.
</P>
<P>
   Trains usually do not run in the wee hours of a Sunday morning.
MARTA ran the train to serve a capacity crowd of fans attending the
Cash Money/Ruff Ryders rap concert at Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Train No. 166 went from the Lindbergh station to the Doraville
station before 2 a.m.. Just north of the Lenox station, it shifted
to the southbound tracks to avoid a section of closed track.
</P>
<P>
   The northbound segment of the Doraville line has been closed
periodically over the past month while MARTA tests a new propulsion
system for its aging fleet of trains. Replacement parts are so
difficult to get that some train cars have no propulsion system.
They are placed between cars with functioning motors.
</P>
<P>
   Train No. 166 proceeded north from Lenox along the southbound
line and dropped riders at Doraville. The operator headed back
south, on the southbound line, on an express run to pick up about
35 riders at Lindbergh and take them to the Dunwoody station.
</P>
<P>
   As the train entered the Lenox station, the operator realized
the train had not been diverted to the northbound lane to avoid
workers hovering over the southbound lane. The operator looked
ahead and saw the cherry picker, where the Spencer's were working,
MARTA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The train was traveling at about 30 mph when it crashed into the
cherry picker, the operator reported to MARTA investigators. It
would have been going faster if electricity had not been shut off
just north of the rider platform.
</P>
<P>
   When the train hit the cherry picker, the impact was so terrific
that both workers were ejected from the bucket. The vehicle's boom
was thrown onto a billboard buried in concrete on the rider
platform, bending it at a 45-degree angle. A safety helmet worn by
one of the men landed on the top of the train after the collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally feel really bad for the family,'' said Dwight
Ferrell, who joined MARTA in October as senior vice president of
operations. ``We are going to do everything we can to make certain
nothing like this ever happens again.''

 SALT LAKE CITY: the road. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Duy demanded to see the disc jockey, not realizing he had been
standing next to her during the police interview. When Duy refused
to leave and began hitting and kicking VanRoosendaal and his
partner, they arrested her. ``Just shoot me,'' she said, according
to their report.
</P>
<P>
   She was charged with stalking, disorderly conduct, assault,
interfering with a police officer and carrying a concealed weapon,
a kitchen knife the police found in her back pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were only misdemeanors, and, given her mental
condition, a psychologist raised questions about Duy's competence
to stand trial. The assistant West Valley City attorney handling
her case, John Huber, did not see any benefit to trying her, he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   So he proposed a form of probation: a ``diversion agreement''
stipulated that if Duy sought mental health treatment and avoided
further trouble, all the charges would be dismissed in two years.
</P>
<P>
   When the two years were up, in November 1998, a secretary in
Huber's office checked to see if there were any further criminal
charges against Duy. The Bureau of Criminal Identification showed
none, and so the charges stemming from the incident at the radio
station were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   It was two months before the shooting at the television station.
</P>
<P>
   What Huber's office and the judge presiding over her case did
not know was that in the intervening period, in December 1997, Duy
had threatened to kill an FBI agent after he declined to help her
stop what she maintained were broadcasts by the radio and
television stations about her sex life. The bureau investigated
her, found that she had psychiatric problems and had her doctors
arrange for her to be picked up, an FBI official said.
</P>
<P>
   Duy was taken to the Neuropsychiatric Institute of the
University of Utah, a high-security hospital. After psychiatrists
there found that she was a danger to others _ the diagnosis was
chronic paranoid schizophrenia _ Mike Evans, a mental health
commissioner who acts as a civil court judge, committed her for 90
days.
</P>
<P>
   When the commitment period was up, Valley Mental Health went to
court to get it extended, arguing that Duy was still a danger to
others and would stop taking her medication, said Jed Ericksen, the
assistant director of adult services. But Evans refused, saying he
was interested only in her current mental state and not the
criminal charges stemming from the incident at the radio station,
Ericksen recalled. Duy's case file was sealed in accordance with
privacy provisions of Utah law, said Kim Zacherson, a clerk for
Evans. The commissioner declined to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had known about the threat against the FBI and about her
court-ordered hospitalization, we would have taken it seriously,''
said Huber, now the chief West Valley City attorney. ``She was in
violation of the diversion agreement, so we would have reinstated
our prosecution. And because of her mental condition, we would
probably have ended up seeking a further court commitment, showing
her pattern of dangerous behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a common problem we have, even in an era of all this
technology,'' Huber said. ``She was able to walk around free and
buy a gun because of a lack of communication between the mental
health system and the criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Killing
</P>
<P>
   The largest gun store in Utah is a squat cinder block structure
in a strip mall. There are racks of rifles on the walls, glass
cases full of semiautomatic pistols and the constant sound of
gunfire from the basement shooting range. Outside, the high,
snow-covered Wasatch mountains loom like a white fortress, and
there is a sign saying Doug's Shoot'n Sports that shows a man
shaped like a bullet and wearing a Stetson hat drawing revolvers
from holsters on both hips.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Duy first came here to look for a gun in November 1998, two
months before the shooting, recalls Larsen, the manager. She was
timid, but so are a lot of women when they enter a gun store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a man's world,'' Larsen said, ``kind of intimidating, so
we tried to be nice to her. She didn't act strange at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Duy did not know how to shoot, and so Larsen took her down to
the basement and offered instruction.
</P>
<P>
   He did not see her again until January, when she came back and
picked out a 9-mm semiautomatic. She was wearing a hooded
sweatshirt hiding her head from view, says David Sorensen, a
customer who was standing next to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made me feel suspicious right away, with the hood,''
Sorensen said in an interview, ``and then when I glanced at her,
she gave me this real scary look.'' (Larsen recalls nothing
particularly suspicious, saying it is hardly uncommon to see people
wearing hooded sweatshirts in January.)
</P>
<P>
   It was too late that night for Larsen to call the Bureau of
Criminal Identification to run a background check, and so Duy came
back the next day. It took only a couple of minutes for her to be
cleared: The bureau checked its criminal-history records, its
outstanding-warrants file and the FBI database, but found no
disqualifying information, said Joyce Carter, the supervisor of the
state agency's firearms section.
</P>
<P>
   Duy then paid $285 for the gun and went back to the basement to
practice for an hour. Larsen noticed on a television monitor that
she was mishandling the gun, holding it with only one hand and a
limp wrist, so that the firing mechanism, which needs to be held
level, was likely to jam. He went down to give her another lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Duy was on a mission, she later told doctors who examined her.
She needed the gun because the voices had told her that the only
way she could stop KSL from reading her mind and informing all of
Salt Lake City about her sex life was to kill a woman who worked at
the station as a broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   When she walked into the television station's reception area and
began shooting, it was like ``going to a beautiful island and I was
spreading flowers at them, shooting at them,'' she later said.

 SALT LAKE CITY: later said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ultimately, after her gun had jammed and she had been subdued,
Sgt. Don Bell of the Salt Lake City police was assigned to
interrogate her. He wondered how anyone could have sold her the
gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not have had to be a rocket scientist to know this
woman was not your normal customer,'' said Bell, the city's senior
crisis negotiator. ``She was swearing a lot, and all she wanted to
know was whether the woman she shot in the head was dead. When I
said no, she was only critically wounded at that point, Lisa said,
`Then this questioning is illegal.'''
</P>
<P>
   The wounded woman did die later. Her name was Anne Sleater, and
she was not even a KSL employee. She was a human resources manager
in AT&AMP;T Wireless offices in the same building as the station's
studios.
</P>
<P>
   A judge ruled that Duy was mentally incompetent to stand trial
and ordered her to the Utah State Hospital for treatment to restore
her to competence. She is still there, and doctors' reports suggest
that there is little chance she will ever be well enough to be
tried.
</P>
<P>
   The Aftermath
</P>
<P>
   Public concern about mentally ill people's ability to buy guns
was further heightened here in Utah three months after the Duy
shooting. Last April 15, Sergei Babarin, a 70-year-old Russian
immigrant who was off his medications for schizophrenia and
depression, killed two people and wounded five others in the Mormon
genealogical library. Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a conservative
Republican, called for a special session of the Legislature to deal
with the issue raised by the two shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates for the mentally ill, along with some judges,
warned that allowing law-enforcement officials access to mental
health records would infringe on the civil rights of emotionally
troubled people. And the powerful speaker of the Utah House of
Representatives, Martin R. Stephens, an NRA supporter, said he was
against ``legislation that will take away people's individual
rights in the name of a little personal safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, almost a year later, Utah has enacted a law requiring
courts that commit people to mental institutions to forward the
information to the Bureau of Criminal Identification. So that the
confidentiality of the records is safeguarded, the bureau can use
the information only for gun checks, and cannot share it with other
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nine states that now provide access to mental health
information for gun background checks have even more stringent
safeguards. In Illinois, the state police each day send a list of
new gun-permit applicants to the state's Department of Mental
Health and Developmental Disabilities, which checks the names
against its database. This means that the state police have no
direct look at the files of the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has adopted a similar system, acting after an
accountant with a history of depression, suicide attempts and
hospitalization killed four of his bosses and then himself at
offices of the state lottery in 1998. But since the accountant,
Matthew Beck, had been hospitalized voluntarily, brought in on an
emergency basis by his father and the police, and not by court
order, the law would not have applied to him or barred him from
buying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   This raises a further troublesome issue, said Kay Redfield
Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often there is not much medical difference between someone who
is voluntarily or involuntarily hospitalized,'' Jamison said.
(Indeed, some patients agree to be hospitalized to avoid
court-ordered treatment.) At least eight of the cases that The
Times studied involved people who bought guns after voluntary
hospitalization, in addition to the eight cases of involuntary
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   To fill this gap, Connecticut last year passed another law, the
first of its kind in the nation, that allows the police to obtain a
court warrant to seize any guns from a person who, in their
judgment, is a danger to himself or others. Soon after the law took
effect last fall, the police used it to confiscate five guns from a
man in North Branford who was depressed after being suspended by
his factory for an assault and had told officers he was going to
kill his neighbors and co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't prove how many lives we may have saved,'' said Mike
Dooty, the deputy police chief in North Branford. ``But in our
eyes, this case had all the telltale signs. As a police department,
we usually don't get to see the signs till after a tragedy has
happened.''

NEW COMIC OPERA BY LEADING COMPOSER WILL OPEN IN HOUSTON 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CHARLES WARD 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A runaway hit novel capturing a turn-of-the-century
Southern town, flaws and all.
</P>
<P>
   An admired film director, raised on a sheep station in the
Australian Outback, who touched universal emotions with his
``Driving Miss Daisy.''
</P>
<P>
   A Methodist minister's son, shaped by the rites of the rural
South, who at age 73 has composed his first comic opera.
</P>
<P>
   A storekeeper of crusty independence in Cold Sassy Tree, Ga.,
who enters a marriage of convenience with a much younger woman _ a
Yankee, no less _ who is deemed a gold-digger by his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Fact and fiction are swirling into focus in Carlisle Floyd's
``Cold Sassy Tree,'' whose Friday opening will be the Houston Grand
Opera's world 25th premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Olive Ann Burns' 1984 novel, ``Cold Sassy Tree'' will
be a marked departure from some of HGO's introductions _ including,
say, the brusque modernism of Sir Michael Tippett's ``New Year''
(world premiere, 1989) or Phillip Glass' elliptical and confusing
``Akhnaten'' (American premiere, 1984).
</P>
<P>
   ``What attracted me to the novel as a possible opera libretto
was several things,'' Floyd said. ``Rich, colorful, vividly drawn
characters, a basic dramatic situation which would impel subsequent
action and events, and a very broad emotional scale, ranging from
broad comedy to intense drama and even tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the comedy that is the major departure for the prolific
Floyd, the leading American opera composer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing comic opera is one devil of a job,'' he said, a matter
of intellect, timing, pacing, calculated effect. The project has
prompted the opera world to note a parallel with ``Falstaff,''
Verdi's last opera and his one great comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Among his other works, Houston Grand Opera has staged Floyd's
two most successful operas: his treatment of John Steinbeck's ``Of
Mice and Men'' and his best-known work, ``Susannah,'' a retelling
of the Biblical story of Susannah and the Elders that Floyd, always
his own librettist, set in Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   About 1981, Floyd's sister gave him ``Cold Sassy Tree'' to read
just for entertainment. Hints of operatic possibilities began to
click, and Floyd passed the novel onto HGO general director David
Gockley, who also liked it. The book had been so popular it led to
a 1989 TV movie starring Faye Dunaway and Richard Widmark.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd's literary skills _ he began studying creative writing at
17 at Converse College in Spartanburg, S.C. _ were challenged by
``Cold Sassy Tree.''
</P>
<P>
   While plentifully populated, the opera centers on a few
characters: storekeeper Rucker Lattimore, his daughters Mary Willis
and Loma, his 14-year-old grandson, Will Tweedy, and the emigre
milliner Love Simpson, who is half Lattimore's age.
</P>
<P>
   Lattimore scandalizes the mythical town of Cold Sassy Tree by
announcing, three weeks after his wife is buried, that he plans to
marry Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   The move is purely pragmatic. He needs help keeping his house
and, thus, maintaining his independence as he ages. Simpson, he
says, is an experienced housekeeper; marrying her will be cheaper
than hiring someone else to do the same chores. In return, Simpson
will receive title to the house and its contents when Lattimore
dies.
</P>
<P>
   The daughters and the community are horrified. They isolate
Simpson, but their mistreatment only leads to an evolution in the
relationship between Simpson and Lattimore. The pair fall in love
and consummate the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Will Tweedy's teen-age life forms a secondary plot. Like his
grandfather, he has nonconformist tendencies. He befriends the
daughter of poor mill-workers in a nearby town and dreams of
becoming a writer _ instead of a businessman who will take over his
grandfather's general store.
</P>
<P>
   A tragedy forces the townspeople to soften their intolerance:
Lattimore is wounded in a robbery at the store. He tells Will to
follow his own heart, but doesn't give Simpson enough time to
reveal the most important news of their short marriage life: She is
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   As the lead singers describe Lattimore and Simpson, they seem
almost destined for each other.
</P>
<P>
   The shopkeeper is a straightforward, no-nonsense kind of man
with ``the best of progressive male thinking at the time,''
according to bass-baritone Dean Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Soprano Patricia Racette finds Simpson ``a very stylish lady in
a small town that's not very stylish.'' She's self-sufficient, an
outsider who has suffered hardships that she has kept to herself.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes talking with film director Bruce Beresford,
one suspects that had Floyd, as the saying goes, set the Yellow
Pages to music, the Australian would have eagerly accepted the job.
</P>
<P>
   After Beresford's 1980 Academy Award nomination for best adapted
screenplay for ``Breaker Morant,'' his directorial projects began
to attract some of the top stars of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't Beresford's star-laden resume that attracted
Gockley and Floyd. Rather, it was his ability, proved emphatically
in ``Driving Miss Daisy'' (which won an Oscar for best picture of
1989), to depict realistic American small-town life without
``Disneyfication.''
</P>
<P>
   Beresford was raised on a sheep station about 300 miles west of
Sydney, Australia _ and 15,000 miles from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in that country environment, he absorbed a cultural legacy
not dissimilar to that of parts of America: a comparatively
well-off populace living in a democratic country founded by
immigrants. He also experienced the gossip and scandals of
small-town life.
</P>
<P>
   Beresford first explored the milieu in 1983 with the film
``Tender Mercies,'' with a screenplay by Oscar-winning Texas writer
Horton Foote.
</P>
<P>
   Beresford became hooked on opera after he moved to London in
1962 to pursue a career in film. He has staged five operas since
the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing Floyd's aria ``Ain't It a Pretty Night'' from
``Susannah'' about 10 years ago won Beresford over long before
Floyd approached him in New Orleans, while he was filming the
recent ``Double Jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I nearly fell over,'' the director said. ``My God, next to
Benjamin Britten, he's my favorite 20th-century opera composer.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after ``Cold Sassy Tree'' opens, Beresford will head for
Vienna to film, in period style, an original script about Alma
Mahler. The siren-like Austrian was wife or lover to many seminal
figures in early 20th-century Viennese culture, including composer
Gustav Mahler.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Floyd may heave a deserved sigh of relief. ``I now
understand why there are so few successful comedies in opera.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Plague of injuries over, FSU's Simon says
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corey Simon knows something about indecision.
</P>
<P>
   Simon was a Parade All-America defensive lineman from Pompano
Beach, Fla., when he signed with Georgia in 1995. But he never
arrived in Athens. Simon asked to be released from his letter of
intent, and after the NCAA started investigating his recruitment,
Georgia decided to let him go.
</P>
<P>
   Simon transferred to Florida State and sat out his freshman
season because of NCAA rules. After a frustrating series of
injuries reduced his production his first two seasons, Simon
finally came into his own as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NFL teams are wondering whether Simon's health is too
much of a risk to choose him among the top 10 picks of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had surgeries early in my career,'' Simon said. ``Everything
is fine, but they definitely are asking about it. When you invest
that much time and money into a person, you want to make sure what
you are getting is not damaged goods. I understand the process and
have no qualms with it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon didn't help himself a few weeks ago when he refused to
lift weights for scouts. Simon said he had a chest contusion at the
time, but the incident caused some teams to further scrutinize his
past injuries.
</P>
<P>
   When Simon finally lifted, he bench-pressed 225 only 20 times,
not a great number for a defensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to buy a brand new Mercedes without test-driving
it first?'' Simon said. ``I've shown everybody my shoulders are
fine. There's nothing else I can do to prove I'm fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon, 6 feet 2 and 297 pounds, proved he's fine during the past
two seasons. He was an All-American after a junior season in which
he had 65 tackles, including 16 for losses, second-best in FSU
history.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Simon helped the Seminoles to their second national
title. In a 46-29 victory over Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl, he
had five tackles, including a sack, broke up a pass and recovered a
fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Simon says he is versatile enough to play nose guard in a 3-4
defensive alignment or tackle in a 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more of a quick kind of guy,'' he said. ``When I have to
get down and dirty and mix it up a little bit, play hard-nosed
football, I can do that as well. I think I have a well-rounded
game.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, FSU coach Bobby Bowden was wondering whether Simon
would play at all. Simon had rotator-cuff surgery after high
school, then more shoulder surgery only four games into his
redshirt-freshman season. As a sophomore, he sat out two games with
a pinched nerve in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed he was unlucky,'' Bowden said. ``I didn't know
if he could get through a season without getting injured.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Eagles, who might take Simon with the sixth
pick, and other NFL teams are wondering the same thing. But Simon
said they can be assured they're getting one thing _ a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have that winning attitude,'' he said. ``We don't know what
it feels like to lose and that's how we took it out on the field. I
love the feeling of victory. That's how I play the game. I don't
play to lose. I don't play for second place.''

   &QL;  FEDERAL BIG DIG REPORT CITES MISMANAGEMENT
</P>
<P>
   By Alex Canizares
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - A federal audit of the Big Dig that shows how
mismanagement has led costs to spiral beyond the project's $12.2
billion cost estimate will be released Tuesday, congressional
offices said.
</P>
<P>
   US Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater will brief
Massachusetts legislators and Gov. Paul Cellucci in the office of
Rep. Joe Moakley, D-South Boston, Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Slater has recently reviewed the much-anticipated report, the
result of a 14-member task force's complete evaluation of the
Central Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel project's finances, accounting
practices, and management and oversight processes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report's contents have been kept under tight wraps,
</P>
<P>
   congressional aides said they expected the document t show that
the project's true costs could drastically exceed the $12.2 billion
price tag maintained by the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Transportation source who asked to remain
anonymous said the report is likely to put the Big Dig's total
price tag as high as $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Boston newspapers reported last week that the auditors may
arrive at a $13.6 billion cost estimate, a whopping $2.8 billion
over the $10.8 billion the Big Dig maintained as accurate just six
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to be shocked,'' the source said of the
state's congressional delegation. ``This is beyond anyone's wildest
dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the discrepancy is expected to lie in the project's
controversial insurance trust fund, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a good safety record, the Big Dig hopes to retrieve
$826 million from the fund in 2017, and also remove $150 million
for construction costs. The department of transportation's
inspector general has long attacked the use of funds from the
insurance program - meant to be used in case of injuries at the
site -- to help fund construction.
</P>
<P>
   The report could also call for changes in management in the
Massachusetts Turnpike Authority. Cellucci is already under
pressure by state lawmakers to fire the project's embattled chief,
James Kerasiotes.
</P>
<P>
   The report ``basically points to a mismanagement of the project
in terms of letting it get out of control or not realizing how the
costs have gotten out of control,'' a congressional aide close to
the task force said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The close relationship between the government-employed Big Dig
managers and private contractors hired to keep the managers
accountable is a longstanding problem, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal highway spokeswoman declined to comment on the
report's findings last night.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is unclear how binding the report's recommendations
will be, aides said Cellucci will face strong pressure to follow
its suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's gut feeling is that this won't be the last
overrun,'' the congressional aide said. ``The key is that as it
gets more expensive, it is up to Massachusetts to come up with a
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington has kept close watch over the Big Dig - 70 percent of
which is paid with federal dollars - since the project announced a
surprise $1.4 billion shortfall in February.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from lawmakers angered by the Big Dig's surprise
cost increases in February, Slater announced an ``action plan'' to
sort out the Big Dig's finances.
</P>
<P>
   He commissioned the task force to open the Big Dig's finance
books, and threatened to freeze all future federal funding until a
finance plan that protects the rest of the state's road and bridge
projects was approved.

ECONOMIC WOES MAY HAVE SPURRED KOREAN SUMMIT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   A collapsing North Korean economy, the growing strength of its
political leader, and fear in South Korea of the consequences of
German-style reunification led the historic announcement Monday of
a summit conference between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   That is the consensus view of present and former US and South
Korean officials and scholars, including Seoul's ambassador to the
United States, Lee Hong Koo, and former assistant Secretary of
Defense Joseph S. Nye Jr., both of whom have been deeply involved
in the politics of the divided peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea accepted the South's longstanding offer of
engagement ``out of sheer necessity,'' Lee said in a telephone
interview from Atlanta, where he was participating in a joint
US-South Korean effort to promote trade and investment between the
countries.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of hostility, the North ``sees there is no real
alternative,'' Lee said. ``Isolation doesn't pay, and the economy
has reached bottom. The only way to survive is to take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nye, dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said
the North's move came from economic weakness, while the South's
increasingly aggressive attempts at engagement in recent years came
from careful study of the social and economic impact of German
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, with the North Korean economy in a tailspin,
``South Korean opinion was split,'' Nye said. ``There was
resistance to aid or accommodation because, some felt, the apple
would just fall off the tree. The North would collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, ``South Koreans have thought through what it
would mean to take over a collapsing North Korea,'' he said. ``They
recognize the considerable disorder that could create, that it
could bring the South Korean economy down again just when it is
recovering from the Asian financial crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, both men said, a strong majority of South Koreans, and the
major world powers, agree that the abrupt absorption of the North's
economy and collapse of its social structure would be undesireable.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Kleiner, a former German ambassador to South Korea who
now is professor of international relations at Boston University,
said that while disastrous economic conditions are clearly a factor
pushing the North, so too is the strength North Korean dictator Kim
Jong Il has gained by weathering the crises of the six years since
the death of his father and predecessor, Kim Il Sung.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kim Jong Il feels he is secure,'' Kleiner said. ``He
survived a critical situation after his father's death, then a
horrible economic situation. Now he has gotten some help from
outside, the economy is a little better, and he feels he can afford
a big step.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all agree, however, that Kim is more secure.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Natsios, a former top official of the Agency for
International Development who now is Massachusetts secretary of
administration and finance, also believes the economic stress is a
key reason for the North Korean moves, but because it has made Kim
insecure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population is traumatized, distressed, suffering. There is
evidence of rage,'' said Natsios, who recently completed work on a
book about the North Korean famine of the mid-1990s. Natsios
interviewed numerous refugees from North Korea in China in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was huge opposition to Kim Jong Il,'' he said. ``People
said things you never would have heard earlir. I think if a second
famine occurs there will be a political and military reaction. Kim
Jong Il is nervous. He is trying to hedge his bets.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued in Washington, President Clinton praised
the two Koreas for agreeing to hold the summit, which is scheduled
for June 12-14 in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. China, Japan
and Russia promised support for the talks, which raise hopes of
easing of tensions along the world's most militarized border.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers said the timing of the announcement _ an apparent
gift to South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's party before
Thursday's parliamentary elections _ was reason for optimism that
relations between the Koreas will stay sweet in the immediate
future. ``But if people interpret this meeting as weakness,'' Nye
warned, ``the North Koreans will compensate with nasty rhetoric.''

 &HT;    ELIAN'S MIAMI RELATIVES UNABLE TO DERAIL TRANSFER, LIKELY TO GET
NOTICE FROM GOVERNMENT TUESDAY
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS

<P>
   MIAMI _ A flurry of court action and a much-delayed meeting
Monday seemed to do little to derail the upcoming hand-over of
6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are expected to send the boy's Miami relatives
a letter Tuesday outlining when and where the boy is to be turned
over for a reunion with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have indicated they want the transfer to happen this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, NBC News reported that Elian's father is
willing to go to South Florida to pick up his son at a neutral
location. The reunion would take place on Wednesday or Thursday,
possibly at Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami, the report
stated.
</P>
<P>
   NBC said the information came from an unnamed American source
directly involved in the negotiations, who met with Juan Miguel
Gonzalez for several hours over the weekend. But federal
immigration officials said Monday that they knew nothing of the
possible trip.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gonzalez spent the day at the home of a top Cuban
diplomat in Bethesda, Md., where he and his wife and baby son have
been living since they arrived in the United States last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, the Florida relatives who have cared for Elian since
his shipwreck in late November failed to show up for a scheduled
meeting with three mental health experts sent by federal officials
to discuss the transfer of the boy. Late in the day, after a rush
of telephone calls, the experts went to a Miami hospital where
Elian's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, has been staying for several
days since she collapsed from nervous exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The experts met for about one hour with Lazaro Gonzales, Elian's
great-uncle, and his attorneys. Elian reportedly was not in the
room, but was nearby with Marisleysis, who the Miami family says
has become a surrogate mother for the boy since his real mother
drowned on the boat with 10 others crossing from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would comment after the meeting ended. The family
has repeatedly demanded that child psychologists meet with the boy
to determine whether the transfer should take place, but U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno has insisted the only role of the
experts is to make the boy's transition as smooth as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family also went to two courts Monday in an effort to
forestall handing over Elian. One set of arguments was filed at the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which is scheduled
to hear an appeal of the family's lawsuit in the case on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   The family is appealing a March decision by a Miami federal
judge that upheld the order by the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service that Elian should be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the family also turned to a Florida family court,
where they had attempted to win custody of Elian in January.
</P>
<P>
   But that effort seemed likely to end in failure, as Miami-Dade
County Family Court Judge Jennifer Bailey expressed serious doubts
about the merits of their case. Bailey told the family she doubted
seriously whether her court had any jurisdiction in the case, but
instructed them to file a brief on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A previous family court judge _ who was removed from the case
for possible conflicts of interest _ ruled in January that the
family could pursue a custody claim. But federal officials brushed
aside the ruling, saying the matter is an immigration issue, not a
custody dispute, and that immigration matters are solely a federal
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   While the family appeared to be quickly running out of options,
two top local officials said they would travel to Washington
Tuesday to meet with Reno in a bid to slow down the transfer of the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Reno reportedly will meet with Miami Mayor Joe Carollo and
Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas, who drew heavy criticism two
weeks ago when he said federal officials were provoking Miami's
Cuban exiles with their handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo said he would ask Reno for a 30-day transition period
for the boy at a neutral location near the Miami home of Elian's
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno has said firmly that she expects Elian to be
transferred to his father this week, and she seemed unlikely to
change her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the home of Elian's relatives in Miami Little Havana
neighborhood, a small band of protestors continued to mill about in
the street, occasionally chanting and singing in support of the
boy. A prayer vigil a few blocks away from the home was expected to
draw large crowds Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors have vowed to form a human chain around the house to
stop the boy's transfer, and some have predicted that violence will
break out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll sit in or do whatever it takes,'' said Michel Reyes, 24,
who said he has been at the house for days with only short breaks.
``We won't attack anybody, but the government doesn't have the same
track record,'' he said, referring to the Branch-Davidian fire near
Waco, Texas.

TV-GOODY-LINEUP (Undated) - Remember ``Must-See TV?'' NBC's big
Thursday night? Five years later, how does it hold up? Not all that
well. Certainly not as well as CBS' legendary 1973 Saturday night
lineup. But here's something that may shock you - although you have
to switch channels a little, the current Sunday night lineup is the
best of the lot. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``E''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TV-GOODY (Undated) - So ABC's news stars are in a huff about
Leonardo DiCaprio's ``interview'' with Bill Clinton? Ha. What right
does anyone who has helped blur the line between journalism and
entertainment have to complain about it? By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story
will move in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TV-GOODY-FAILSAFE (Undated) - It's foolish to deny that the
car-race syndrome - we only watch for the accidents - isn't a
powerful draw of live TV. Yet there was more to Sunday night's
`Fail Safe` than hunting for errors. This was a taste of what
viewers my age have been missing, an aspect of the medium that has
gone wanting for years. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the
``E'' category. &QL;

COMMENTARY: SAVING COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ I had a chat in Bogota the other day with a
group of government officials and businessmen, and I asked them all
one question: When you go outside, how many security guards do you
take with you? The answers were: 20, 6, 1, 8, 10, 2, 3, 8 and 5. No
surprise. Some 3,000 people were kidnapped here last year by
guerrillas, and many judges and journalists threatened with
chilling messages, such as having funeral wreaths sent to their
homes _ with their names on them.
</P>
<P>
   This is the terrifying context we have to keep in mind as we
consider whether the U.S. Senate should approve the $1.7 billion
plan to strengthen Colombia's ability to fight drug traffickers and
forge a peace with the guerrillas. There are two ways to think
about ``Plan Colombia.'' One way is to get wrapped up in the
details _ the helicopters, the training. The other way _ the right
way _ is to step back and ask yourself what kind of courage it
takes to stay in Colombia right now and be a judge who puts drug
lords in jail or a politician who fights for the rule of law _
knowing the criminals have millions in drug money and would kill
your kids in a second.
</P>
<P>
   It takes real courage, and that's why the people trying to hold
this place together deserve our support. Sure, the democratic
government of President Andres Pastrana isn't perfect. But it has a
core of decent officials who every day risk their lives by just
going to work. Ask yourself if you would have the same courage.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Pastrana why he stays. ``This is our country, it's the
only country we have to leave to our children,'' shrugged the
president, who was once kidnapped while running for Bogota mayor.
``I believe in this country so much that even after being
kidnapped, and even after having my wife's father killed by
kidnappers, my wife and I had another baby _ a girl. Look, we've
sacrificed the best policemen, the best judges, the best
journalists in this country. Whatever you want to write about us,
don't write that we are not on the front line in the war on
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked the head of Colombia's navy, Adm. Sergio Garcia, what it
was like to be an officer here. He said it was sort of like being a
movie star, with people always trying to get at you, only they
don't want your autograph, they want to kill you _ ``so even your
friends don't want to be in a restaurant with you, and they don't
want their kids near your kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombians tell this joke: After God created Colombia, an angel
asked God why he gave all the beauty to one country _ rain forests,
mountains, oceans, savanna _ and God answered: ``Ha! Wait till you
see what kind of people I put there!''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Colombia's mafia processed cocaine grown from coca in
Peru. But as Peru drove the coca growers out, they migrated to the
rain forest in Southern Colombia _ one of the largest unbroken
expanses of rain forest left on earth, but also a region without
much government. The drug mafia is now chopping down the rain
forest _ thousands of acres each month _ then laying down
herbicides, planting coca, processing it into cocaine in rain
forest labs, throwing the chemicals in the rivers, and then flying
the drugs out from grass airstrips.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying Colombia's drug war is a real 40-year-old social
struggle between Marxist guerrillas and right-wing vigilantes
(32,000 killings last year). But let's cut the nonsense: Colombia's
guerrillas may have started as a romantic movement against an
unjust oligarchy _ they may have started as a movement that ate to
fight. But today, these guerrillas are fighting to eat _ fighting
the government because they make tons of money protecting drug
operations in the rain forest. In between the guerrillas and the
vigilantes (who also profit from drugs), Colombia's silent majority
is held hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Colombians are at fault for having been too tolerant of the
early drug lords. And Americans are at fault for their insatiable
appetite for cocaine. But here's the bottom line: If we give the
Colombian majority the aid it needs to fight the drug Mafia there
is a chance _ and it's no sure thing _ that it will be able to
forge a domestic peace. If we don't _ and this is a sure thing _
the problem will only get worse, it will spew instability across
this region, and the only rain forest your kids will ever see is
the Rainforest Cafe.

CITING NASDAQ STRESS, SEC REVERSES DECIMAL QUOTE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A statue of George Washington guards Federal Hall in
lower Manhattan, a bustling location for his 1789 inauguration.
Today, Washington's gaze is aimed down the narrow, crooked passage
called Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   That's how The Street likes its politicians: They are welcome to
watch, but no tinkering, please, in the workings of the investment
world. That sentiment is strongest in times of market uncertainty,
such as now.
</P>
<P>
   As the Nasdaq Composite index was tumbling 6 percent Monday _
its third wild day in a week _ Wall Street scored a victory against
politicians. The Securities and Exchange Commission reversed its
order to begin a conversion, on July 3, to pricing all stocks in
decimals, rather than the traditional fractions _ $50.1875 a share,
not 50 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in dollars and cents was being pushed by a Congress
seeking to simplify trading for average investors moving into the
stock market in droves. It would also save up to $1 billion a year
by improving the prices investors pay for stocks they buy, Congress
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the SEC, in a letter to Congress, said now is not the time
and cited Nasdaq's ``lack of readiness.'' The agency did not
propose an alternative date for the conversion by the brokerage
industry and by US stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC was apparently capitulating to Nasdaq officials who have
maintained that it would be impossible to meet the summer deadline.
More quietly, officials of the computerized exchange have made
clear they are already struggling to handle an explosion in trading
volume, wildly swinging stock prices and strains that are pushing
its systems to their limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time of unprecedented volume and volatility,'' the SEC's
chairman, Arthur Levitt, told Congress, ``I believe it would be
ill-advised to force a major structural change in our markets
without the confidence that order will be maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   On ten days this year, Nasdaq's share volume has exceeded the 2
billion mark, a record first achieved on Feb. 17. Volume continues
to rise: Nasdaq volume hit nearly 2.9 billion last Tuesday as the
market plummeted 500-plus points before its remarkable bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   Trading bottlenecks have caused several system glitches at the
Nasdaq in recent months, ranging from trivial to interruptions in
trading for several costly minutes. And trading would accelerate
more, experts said, in a conversion to decimals. As trading
increments become smaller in a conversion from 1/16ths _ the
equivalent of 6.25 cents _ to 5 cents or 1 cent, it would increase
the number of price points at which investors could bid on stocks,
adding to buying and selling activity.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Goldstein, a professor at the University of Colorado,
said the SEC, in seeking a delay, is protecting Nasdaq from
anything that might threaten its stability. Last Tuesday, for
example, Nasdaq's so-called message volume _ requests to change
standing orders to buy or sell stocks _ was severely backed up as
the market was tanking, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their computer systems are very close to the edge. The NYSE
can handle five to 10 times its (current) volume, but if Nasdaq
doubled its volume it would be in a lot of trouble. It might even
shut down,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while NYSE officials said publicly that their systems
are ``ready'' for conversion at any time, Nasdaq officials have
been seeking to delay decimals until next year. Nasdaq's chairman,
Frank Zarb, said recently that he supports trading in decimals.
But, ``We will not put investors and the market at risk by forging
ahead too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq declined to comment on the SEC's letter.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt discussed a compromise, in the absence of a full
conversion to decimals. He said his agency would consider a limited
test this fall on select stocks traded on the NYSE, the American
Stock Exchange and some regional exchanges _ but not on
Nasdaq-listed stocks. He also expressed concern that this move,
too, may ``pose risks to systemic stability'' and ``harm the
investors we seek to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Mere suggestions that some stocks would be traded in decimals,
some in fractions, caused angst for brokerage industry firms on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   A ``bifurcated'' system,'' said Margaret Draper, spokeswoman for
the Securities Industry Association, a lobbying group for Wall
Street and regional brokerage firms, would ``create confusion and
be at cross purposes to the whole goal of decimalization, which is
to make it more investor friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   SIA, whose members make markets in Nasdaq-listed stocks, have
said publicly they would convert to decimals. But critics have
accused the industry of digging in its heels because the move to
decimals would shrink spreads between bid and ask prices, eating
into market makers' profits. Spreads are used by market makers at
brokerages to make profits while they are buying and selling
Nasdaq-listed stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Houtkin, a career market maker who now runs a day-trading
firm in Montvale, N.J., All-Tech Direct Inc., said the industry had
used Nasdaq's acute capacity problems to push its agenda of delay.
SIA estimated it would cost the industry an estimated $900 million
to convert their computer systems and prepare for decimals.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street firms ``are scared to death about what's going to
happen with decimals,'' Houtkin said in an interview last month.
``Market makers don't want decimals _ we're talking about spreads
going down to a penny.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Abbey, a PaineWebber executive who chairs the decimal
committee for the SIA, said members just want a smooth conversion.
SIA recommended first converting to nickel increments _ $1.05,
$1.10 etc. _ because it would be ``least disruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there will be many more trades, smaller trades. We
know there will be many more quotes sent out because prices will
need to move a little less before you need to quote again _ a penny
or two rather than 6 cents,'' Abbey said. ``Computers and networks
all need to be both changed and significantly enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the delay, staff for representatives pushing
conversion to decimals _ Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, and
Michael Oxley, a Ohio Repulican _ said they were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are losing money every day on this,'' said Oxley's
spokeswoman, Peggy Peterson. ``Technology and competition are
making (stock) trading cheaper and investors ought to get the
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   But PaineWebber's Abbey wonders about the proposed benefits for
investors. If the number of potential prices at which stocks can be
bought and sold is increased, he argued investors would be
overwhelmed with the lightning-fast updates of trading data on
their computer screen. Even now, he said, ``The screen is
constantly flashing at you _ imagine it flashing at two or three
times the rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's stock exchanges already trade in decimals,
and proponents argue that it would standardize trading at a time
securities markets are globalizing.
</P>
<P>
   But, Nasdaq is the dominant concern of the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of liquidity _ the ability to find a buyer for a
stock when investors are selling _ was thrown into the spotlight a
week ago, when the stock markets plunged because there were not
enough buyers to snap up stocks being sold. Stocks remarkably
rebounded by day's end, but the depth of the decline sent tremors
of anxiety through The Street.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who analyzed NYSE's 1997 move from trading stocks in
eighths to sixteenths, said mutual fund managers would have more
difficulty buying large blocks of stock if decimals are used.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said decimals, per se, aren't the issue. Smaller
trading increments are the issue, because this would provide more
places for more investors to cut in _ with a slightly higher bid _
to buy stocks. This, in turn, would reduce the number of investors
willing to place ``limit orders,'' orders in which an investor
stands ready to buy at specific prices. ``Limit orders provide
liquidity,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors buying a few shares may get a better price
in a decimal system, Goldstein said. But, mutual funds _ indeed,
all investors _ would suffer if liquidity is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this should be done,'' Goldstein said.

LAWYERS FILE REZULIN CLASS-ACTION SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Smithe is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A law firm Monday said it filed a class-action lawsuit
against Warner-Lambert Co. over a diabetes prescription drug,
Rezulin, that has been linked to 63 deaths from liver failure.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., by the
law firm Gilman and Pastor LLP, follows a March 21 decision by the
company to withdraw the orally-taken drug from the market at the
request of the US Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Although a spate of individual cases have been launched over
Rezulin, Gilman and Pastor claim they are the first to file a
class-action suit.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert, responding to the suit, acknowledged that some
patients experienced adverse reactions while taking Rezulin. But
the company said it had adequately warned patients about potential
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Morris Plains, N.J., estimated that
500,000 people took Rezulin last year. The diabetes drug generated
revenues of $625 million for Warner-Lambert in 1999, down 16
percent from $748 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also named the company's pharmaceutical division,
Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., which aggressively promoted,
marketed and distributed Rezulin, the brand name for the compound
known as troglitazone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeking a class of users for court-supervised medical
monitoring for those who took Rezulin and should either have a
blood test or an echocardiogram to determine if they have suffered
any injuries to their liver or heart,'' said Daniel D'Angelo , an
attorney at Gilman and Pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin was approved for sale by the FDA in January 1997. It has
since undergone several product warning label modifications, after
some patients died of liver failure and others complained of side
effects to their liver. Last June, the FDA reclassified Rezulin
from a sole diabetic treatment to a drug of last resort for
patients who failed to respond to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also cites a decision by Glaxo Wellcome Inc., which had
rights to Rezulin in Europe, to suspend sales in Great Britain
because of reported deaths and liver injuries in the United States
and Japan. The drug was banned in England in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Warner-Lambert knew of liver damage and related
injuries, it ``persisted in selling the product without taking
action to protect consumers,'' according to the 19-page complaint.
The class-action suit is seeking unspecified monetary damages,
patient testing and treatment of those who are at risk of
development heart and liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement after the suit was filed, Warner-Lambert, said
some patients had adverse reactions while taking Rezulin.
``However, the company adequately warned about risks associated
with the product, and we intend to vigorously defend any
lawsuits,'' Warner-Lambert said in its statement.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action suit, filed on behalf of plaintiff Otis R.
Smithe of Northwood, N.H., claims that Warner-Lambert and
Parke-Davis misled Rezulin users over the risks of liver or heart
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband took Rezulin for a year and a half to treat his
diabetes and he developed problems with his kidneys so the doctor
switched him to Glucophage (the nation's leading oral diabetic pill
from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.), '' said Marianna Smithe, whose
husband is 74 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert, which has been successful with Lipitor, its
cholesterol-lowering drug, will merge with Pfizer Inc. this year.
Warner-Lambert said it set aside $100 million to cover the cost of
taking Rezulin off the market. A company spokesman said those funds
were unrelated to any litigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas has had one of the nation's worst public health records
for decades. More than a quarter of its citizens have no health
insurance. Its Mexican border is a hotbed of contagion. The state
ranks near the top in the nation in rates of AIDS, diabetes,
tuberculosis and teen-age pregnancy, and near the bottom in
immunizations, mammograms and access to physicians.
</P>
<P>
   But since George W. Bush became governor in 1995, he has not
made health a priority, his aides acknowledge. He has never made a
speech on the subject, his press office says. His administration
opposed a patient's bill of rights in 1995 before grudgingly
accepting it in 1997, and fought unsuccessfully to limit access to
the new federal Children's Health Insurance Program in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   With health care near the top of the political agenda, Bush will
begin discussing insurance and other health issues starting on
Tuesday with a speech in Cleveland. Democrats, not waiting for his
proposals, have already been attacking him for his record in Texas.
But politics aside, two things are clear: Texas' health problems
run far deeper than the identity of any office-holder in Austin,
and Bush has not tried to tackle them, despite a large state budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In the critical area of expanding insurance coverage, Bush's
administration has moved slowly. Among Texans of working age, the
percentage without coverage rose slightly under Bush and is higher
than in any state but Arizona. The numbers are even worse among
poor children, and hundreds of thousands of them are not enrolled
in Medicaid even though they qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to be interviewed for this article, but the views
expressed by the state's commissioner of health, Dr. William R.
Archer III, cast a light on the Bush administration's approach to
the issue. (Archer, the son of Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the governor
asked him to apply for the commissioner's job; he was formally
chosen by the Board of Health in 1997, and took office after Bush
approved the appointment.)
</P>
<P>
   Almost alone among health experts in Texas, Archer minimizes the
importance of the low rate of health insurance _ a protection that
two-fifths of the state's poor children lack. In an interview,
Archer said that while ``eventually we have to insure everybody,''
he believed the uninsured were still getting care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think insurance is important,'' he said. ``But I don't think
it's the most important thing.'' He said he doubted that coverage
made much real difference to health.
</P>
<P>
   When told of Archer's view, one of the state's leaders in public
health, Dr. Ron Anderson of Parkland Hospital in Dallas, said,
``Then he hasn't read the literature. Shame on him!''
</P>
<P>
   Archer also accused Texas doctors of opposing preventive health
care out of misplaced concern for their own billings. ``If I can
prevent certain diseases upstream, and then there is no need to
treat that disease, then there is nothing to charge against,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And he has stirred disputes with his efforts to move his
department away from the traditional services it has provided to
examine the cultural and spiritual causes of unhealthy behavior and
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said Texas' high teen-age pregnancy rate came
about because the state's Hispanic population lacked ``the belief
in your culture that getting pregnant is a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to go to an Hispanic community and say `Well, we
need to get you into family planning,' they say, `No, I want to be
pregnant,''' he said. ``It doesn't work very well.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a private research
organization, Hispanic teen-agers in Texas had a higher pregnancy
rate than whites or blacks, but the white rate was among the
nation's highest, too.
</P>
<P>
   The health problems of Texas go back far beyond Bush and Archer.
Texas ranks 25th in per-capita income, just ahead of Oregon, but
taxes lightly and provides a modest level of public services. Only
six states collect a smaller percentage of their citizens' personal
income in state and local taxes than Texas does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flip side of having no income tax is having a very low
level of services,'' said Anne Dunkelberg, a senior policy analyst
at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research
group in Austin representing low-income taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Archer explained why the state tolerated having 598,000 children
eligible for Medicaid, the federal-state health plan for the poor,
but not enrolled in the program: ``The problem is that the
Legislature knows that if we are successful, and we got all those
kids registered, they would not balance their budgets any more.
It's not one person saying `Don't do this.' It's not one agency
saying `Don't do this.' It's sort of `Why would we all rock the
boat at this point?'''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Archer, most prominent health experts in Texas see
the low insurance rates as the state's biggest health problem.
Clair Jordan, executive director of the Texas Nurses Association,
said ``uninsured children end up in the most costly place _ the
emergency room.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Elliott Naishtat, a Democrat who is chairman of the
House Human Services Committee, said, ``The biggest health problem
in Texas is the exorbitant number of people, primarily children,
who have no health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Without insurance, said Jose Camacho, head of the Texas
Association of Community Health centers, children get only sporadic
treatment at best for ear infections, asthma and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance coverage in Texas has been stagnant for several
years. According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the
Uninsured, among Texans 19 to 65 years old, 27.5 percent were
uninsured in 1998, compared to 19.7 percent for the nation. In
1994, before Bush took office, the Texas percentage was 26.5 and
the national figure 17.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among poor children the coverage was much worse. In 1998 39.1
percent of Texans under 18 living at no more than twice the poverty
level lacked insurance, compared to 25.7 percent nationally. In
1994, 36.7 percent of poor children in Texas and 22.8 percent of
poor children nationally were uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for the low rates of insurance, including
migratory labor, a large rural population and many low-wage workers
in nonunion jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the single biggest reason is probably the state's Medicaid
program, which has some of the nation's most severe limits and
complicated eligibility rules and thus makes Texas ``one of the
most difficult states for someone to figure out how to get
enrolled,'' according to Diane Rowland, executive vice president of
the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group that
focuses on health issues.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Garnet Coleman, a Democrat from Houston who is vice
chairman of the House Public Health Committee, contended the state
had created an ``atmosphere of fear'' around applying for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Bertha Rochel, a housewife interviewed at an El Paso clinic,
said some of her neighbors did not seek Medicaid because ``they are
afraid and maybe some of their children are illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some others would find their citizenship applications barred if
they sought government benefits now. Camacho pointed to the Texas
rule that missing an appointment meant a Medicaid applicant had to
start over.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children without health insurance _ now at 1.4 to
1.5 million _ may drop sharply in the next year when Texas finally
starts enrolling children in the children's health insurance
program, known as CHIP, which was enacted by Congress in 1997. Bush
let the question wait until the 1999 legislative session, and
fought to limit the program's coverage to children with family
incomes up to 150 percent of the poverty line, although the federal
law allowed covering children up to 200 percent of the poverty
level.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush approach would have excluded 200,000 of the 500,000 who
became eligible when the Legislature insisted on the higher level.
Bush said at a news conference in Sacramento, Calif., on Thursday,
``I signed the 200 percent bill'' and would not say why he pushed
for 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The reason given at the time for Bush's position, legislators
said, was a fear that a big new program would be costly by itself
and turn up a ``spillover'' of many thousands who were already
eligible for Medicaid, which has an income ceiling of 100 percent
of poverty. The federal government reimburses Texas 61.5 cents out
of every dollar spent for Medicaid, and will pay 75 cents on the
dollar for CHIP.
</P>
<P>
   The state has never used the millions of federal dollars made
available by the 1996 welfare law to reach out to potential
Medicaid enrollees, but has a large effort planned for CHIP. Don
Gilbert, the state Commissioner of Health and Human Services, said
he expected to enroll 420,000 children in CHIP and perhaps another
120,000 in Medicaid over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The worst health problems in Texas, with disease rates at Third
World levels, is on the Mexican border. Almost a fourth of the
state's population lives in 43 border counties along the 1,264
miles of the Rio Grande River from El Paso to Brownsville, and as
far from the river as San Antonio, about 125 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Except for San Antonio, it is a poor area. El Paso, Laredo,
McAllen and Brownsville are four of the five poorest cities in the
country. About a third of the population lives below the federal
poverty level. All but two of the counties have a shortage of
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the state comptroller's office, published in 1998,
observed, ``Health conditions in the Texas-Mexico border are among
the worst in the U.S., so distressful that reports on health
conditions suggest a remote country in need of medical
missionaries, not a part of Texas.'' For example, it said, ``cases
of hepatitis A, a gastrointestinal virus borne by contaminated food
and water, are four times as common in the Rio Grande Valley as in
the rest of Texas.'' Tuberculosis, diabetes, and dengue fever are
other high-incidence diseases.
</P>
<P>
   At the border, some improvement has been made in recent years,
but very slowly, said Dr. Laurance N. Nickey, a retired city-county
health director who now serves on the bi-national border health
commission. He said 72,000 people (about a tenth of El Paso's
population) live in unincorporated colonias, or settlements, where
``some of the water is safe to drink,'' and less than half have
safe sewerage.
</P>
<P>
   As primitive as some conditions are on the U.S. side of the
border, they are worse in Mexico. Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.6
million people across from El Paso, is just building its first two
sewage treatment plants. Until now, a 17-mile open trench has been
used for sewage disposal, and it pollutes the groundwater on both
sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said Bush had persuaded the Mexican authorities to put
money into tuberculosis control, a move they had resisted because
the border states in Mexico are not nearly its poorest.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso alone sees about 65 million legal border crossings a
year. ``With this kind of a rate of crossings,'' said Nickey, ``you
don't keep measles on one side of the border and chicken pox on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share the same air. We share the same water. We share the
same pollution. We share the same hazardous waste,'' he said. And
because the border counties are a gateway to the rest of Texas and
the rest of the country, he said, ``it's not just a border issue.
It involves the whole United States.''

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ With the voices inside her head ordering her to
kill, Lisa Duy walked into Doug's Shoot'n Sports here to buy a
Smith &AMP; Wesson 9-mm semiautomatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
   For Doug's, the biggest gun store in Utah, the transaction was
routine. The manager, Dave Larsen, called the Utah Bureau of
Criminal Identification to run a background check on Duy, and the
agency quickly approved the sale, having found no record of felony
convictions or mental illness. In the basement shooting range,
Larsen showed Duy, 24 and unemployed, how to hold and fire the
heavy stainless-steel gun. The only thing unusual, he thought, was
that as she left the store, headed for the bus stop outside, she
was wearing the shooting-range ear protectors he had lent her.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours after leaving Doug's, on Jan. 14, 1999, Duy,
ear protectors still in place, walked into the studios of
television station KSL a few blocks from the Mormon Temple and
began firing her new weapon. She shot more than four dozen times in
all, killing a young mother and wounding the building manager.
</P>
<P>
   What the background check had been unable to detect was that Duy
(pronounced dwee) had a long history of psychiatric problems, had
in fact been found to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and,
only a year before the check, had been committed to a mental
hospital by a judge after threatening to kill an FBI agent, an
encounter that sprang from her delusions that the station was
broadcasting information about her sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 episodes of rampage killings examined for this series
by The New York Times, none better illustrates than the case of
Lisa Duy just how difficult it can be to enforce a key provision of
the nation's fundamental gun control law. That provision prohibits
people who have been involuntarily committed to mental institutions
from buying a handgun. But laws in most states guard the privacy of
the mentally ill, and to protect them from stigma these statutes
generally bar law-enforcement agencies from access to mental health
records.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, gun background checks of people with psychiatric
problems typically fail to turn up their mental health history, a
loophole that has contributed to the wave of school and workplace
shootings of the last decade. In the 100 cases reviewed by The
Times, the vast majority of them from the last 10 years, half the
killers were people with serious mental illness, and at least eight
had been involuntarily committed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, fueled by those shootings, there is a growing debate
pitting public-safety concerns against the rights of the mentally
ill. Last month, more than a year after the Duy shooting, which was
followed by a similar one in April 1999, Utah became one of the few
states that give law-enforcement agencies mental health information
for background checks on prospective gun buyers. Connecticut acted
similarly last fall, after a state lottery employee with a history
of severe mental illness killed four of his bosses and committed
suicide in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The provision that bars handgun purchases by people who have
ever been involuntarily committed is more than 30 years old, dating
from adoption of the sweeping federal Gun Control Act of 1968.
These are frequently the most disturbed people, those forced into
hospitals because courts have determined that they may harm
themselves or others.
</P>
<P>
   But the provision is most often meaningless: Over the years, an
unlikely coalition of the National Rifle Association, mental health
advocates and civil liberties groups have largely blocked efforts
to permit the agencies that conduct background checks to gain
access to information about who has been committed. At the time of
her rampage, it was against the law in Utah for the court that had
committed Duy to so notify a law-enforcement agency.
</P>
<P>
   Even the FBI, which conducts background checks for the majority
of states, has mental health records only on people treated in
Veterans Affairs hospitals, plus an assortment of 41 other
individuals, among its data on some 40 million people that the
bureau now keeps for its system of national instant criminal
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   So when Duy, completing a mandatory federal handgun application,
answered no to a question asking whether she had ever been
committed, the Utah Bureau of Criminal Identification had no mental
health records in its database to catch her lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how Lisa could buy a gun,'' said her
mother, Khanh Duy, an ethnic Chinese who immigrated with the family
from Vietnam in 1980, when Lisa was a little girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lisa is a good girl,'' said Mrs. Duy, speaking in Mandarin.
``But she heard voices, and she had been in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Another case in which a person who had been involuntarily
hospitalized was able to buy a gun despite the federal law, and
went on to kill with it, was that of Gracie Verduzco, a 35-year-old
paranoid schizophrenic. Verduzco had been committed to mental
hospitals three times, by judges in both Arizona and, after
threatening President Clinton, the District of Columbia. Yet she
was able to buy a .38-caliber revolver at a pawnshop in Tucson,
Ariz., and she used it to kill one person and wound four others at
a post office there on May 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And near Atlanta, James Calvin Brady, a black man who believed a
machine had been implanted in his stomach that told him to kill
white people, walked out of the Georgia Regional Hospital, where he
had been involuntarily committed, and the same day bought a
.38-caliber revolver at a pawnshop. The next day, April 25, 1990,
he killed one person and wounded four at a shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Both Verduzco and Brady lied on their gun applications in
denying involuntary commitment, and there was no information to
catch them.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between the rights of the mentally ill and the kind
of screening that would help keep guns out of their reach can be a
wrenching one.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Cottrell, executive director of the Utah branch of the
National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, an organization of families
of the disturbed, has a daughter with schizophrenia who, like Duy,
heard voices. One day the voices told her to kill her mother, as a
sacrifice to silence them. The daughter's psychiatrist called the
police, who arrested her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We family members have a real dilemma,'' Cottrell said. ``I
used to lie awake at night worrying my daughter would buy a gun and
carry out her delusions. So I think people who have been
involuntarily committed should be in the computer for gun checks.
But we have to be very careful we don't add to the stigma against
mental illness and make people afraid to seek treatment.''

HALO REVEALS REMAINS OF MILKY WAY'S GALACTIC SNACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By JAMES GLANZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers have long suspected a dark secret about Earth's
galaxy, the Milky Way. They have even seen other galaxies engaging
in the macabre behavior at the core of this secret. But without
irrefutable proof, astronomers refused to admit that it might be
commonplace closer to home. Now, they have that proof.
</P>
<P>
   The Milky Way is a cannibal. It consumes other galaxies and
makes their stars its own.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence comes from some of the first data to emerge from
the multi-institutional collaboration called the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, an $80 million project that will eventually observe and
categorize hundreds of millions of celestial objects over a quarter
of the entire sky. Faint stars that the Sloan collected in two
patches of the sky have revealed, in effect, the partly digested
remains of two small galaxies that the Milky Way's gravity grabbed,
perhaps a billion or 2 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The clumpy patches turned up not in the bright disk of the
galaxy, but in the thinly populated sphere of stars and other
matter around it. The telltale remains hover about 150,000
light-years from the galactic center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the stars are formed in other galaxies, and then
are being assimilated into our galaxy,'' said Dr. Heidi Newberg, an
astrophysicist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.,
and a Sloan collaborator. The inevitable conclusion, she said, is
that ``we're munching on the little ones,'' or eating up smaller
galaxies that once glittered on the outskirts of the Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   Newberg said it was still uncertain whether all of the stars of
the halo were captured in this way. But the new results do provide
strong support for theories holding that the halo was assembled bit
by bit after the disk formed. Alternative theories maintain that
the halo formed all at once, and that material inside it later
settled into a disk.
</P>
<P>
   The data were assembled from observations of two patches of sky,
one in the northern galactic plane and one in the south, made by
the Sloan Survey's automated telescope at Apache Point, N.M., said
Dr. Brian Yanny, an astrophysicist at the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory and a Sloan collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   The telescopic images included a few million stars all told. But
within that sample, the images revealed elongated clumps of hot
objects called A stars. The northern clump contained about 2,000 A
stars and the southern clump about 1,000. The northern clump also
turned out to be traced by another kind of star, the blinking
variable stars called RR Lyraes, said Dr. Zeljko Ivezic, an
astrophysicist who is a Sloan collaborator at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   Both types of star have a special property: Their intrinsic
brightness is approximately known, so their distance from Earth can
be estimated from their apparent brightness in the sky. That
knowledge allowed the Sloan astronomers to reconstruct the
three-dimensional shapes of the clumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very diffuse and elongated,'' Yanny said, or roughly
cigar shaped, 15,000 light-years wide and 60,000 light-years long.
They no longer look like little galaxies, he said, because
``they've been disrupted by the gravitational potential'' of the
Milky Way _ partly digested, in less clinical language.
</P>
<P>
   Such faint groupings of stars can be seen only using a vast
survey like the Sloan, Ivezic said. He added that the precise way
in which the former galaxies were being torn to pieces could reveal
the distribution of a mysterious, nonluminous type of matter called
dark matter in the halo. ``That will constrain very strongly how
the halo is built,'' Ivezic said.
</P>
<P>
   The finding supports the basic theoretical picture of large
structures in the universe being formed from smaller ones, said Dr.
Abraham Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard University, who is not a
member of the Sloan Survey.
</P>
<P>
   And as for the Milky Way, Loeb said, ``you can call it a
cannibal. We have to eat to feed ourselves. And a galaxy feeds on
these smaller components.'' &QL;

NASDAQ INDEX DECLINES 258 POINTS; DOW RISES 75 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KENNTH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors continued to sell shares of technology
companies on Monday, sending the Nasdaq composite index plunging
258.25 points, or 5.8 percent, to 4,188.20. It was the second-worst
point decline for the index, behind last Monday's 349.15 point
drop.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of the slide was something of a surprise, if only
because by the end of last week the Nasdaq had regained much of the
loss it sustained last Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the technology-heavy Nasdaq was led by big drops
in stocks like Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Qualcomm and JDS Uniphase.
The Nasdaq composite index has fallen 17 percent since it peaked at
5,048.62 on March 10. Even with those declines, the index is still
up 2.9 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after last week, valuations in technology stocks have to
continue to be a concern,'' said John McStay, managing partner of
John McStay Investment Counsel, a Dallas-based firm that manages
more than $5.5 billion. ``The market's statement was made with a
comma, not a period.''
</P>
<P>
   While the slide in technology stock prices is worrisome, McStay
and others said the resilience of stocks in other sectors is a
positive for the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.08 points, or 0.7
percent, to 11,186.56, on strength in bank, drug and consumer
stocks. Meanwhile, technology stocks helped to drag down the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which fell 11.89 points, or 0.8
percent, to 1,504.46. And a slide in technology and biotechnology
company stock prices pulled the Russell 2000 index of small
capitalization companies down 24.33 points, or 4.5 percent, to
518.66.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's recovery in technology stocks may have buoyed some
spirits, but articles in various magazines and newspapers over the
weekend about the need to raise margin requirements on stocks
probably did not sit well with speculators and day traders.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did comments from Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at
Merrill Lynch. McCabe issued a report to clients on Monday morning
saying that technology stocks have begun what he described as an
``important corrective trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors should use rebounds in technology stock prices to
reduce their exposure in stocks that have fallen 40 percent to 50
percent from their recent highs, McCabe said. At the same time, he
urged investors ``to increase commitments to the energy, basic
industry, consumer-cyclical and financial sectors of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Traders were reluctant to predict if the Nasdaq would retest the
levels reached during trading last Tuesday, when the Nasdaq
composite index fell as low as 3,649.11. But they said the index
could fall further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could the Nasdaq go back to 3,900 or so?'' asked Kenneth M.
Sheinberg, head of listed trading at SG Cowan. ``That could be done
fairly easily. The rally off the intra-day lows last week was kind
of a bear trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheinberg said market reaction to Motorola's earnings will go a
long way to determining how technology shares fare on Tuesday.
After the market close on Monday, the cellular phone manufacturer
reported first-quarter profits of 59 cents a share, more than
double what it earned during the period a year ago. Most Wall
Street analysts had projected an increase of 58 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone loves the number, it will be a relief,'' Sheinberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no relief for technology shares on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm fell 11 1/16, to 141 3/16. JDS Uniphase dropped 11 3/4,
to 110 1/8. Oracle was down 4 5/8, to 82 1/2. And Sun Microsystems
lost 7 13/16, to 91.
</P>
<P>
   But financial stocks did well.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's financials index gained 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was led higher by J.P. Morgan, which rose 4 11/16, to
134 9/16; American Express, which gained 4 1/8, to 143 3/16; and
Citigroup, which closed at 62 1/4, up 3 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   And drug stocks did well.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer rose 1, to 39 13/16. Warner-Lambert jumped 3 3/8, to 107
5/16. And Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 1 7/8, to 61 3/8.

   COMMENTARY (moved in the ``k'' news file)
</P>
<P>
   WHY DO THEY HATE HILLARY SO MUCH?
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY-HATERS-SLATE _ Judging from the outpouring of
high-pitched, even hate-filled books on the subject of Hillary
Clinton, the hideous possibility of her election to be the junior
senator from the Empire State is looming large in many prolific
minds. What, exactly are the Hillary Haters so worried about? What
sort of senator would she be that she evokes such visceral
response? By Jodie T. Allen.
</P>
<P>
   THE ORTHODOX JEW AND THE VICE PRESIDENCY
</P>
<P>
   JEWISH-VICE-PRESIDENT-SLATE _ Could an Orthodox Jew serve as
president of the United States? The question isn't strictly
Talmudic anymore, since the name of an Orthodox Jew has cropped up
on Democratic vice-presidential candidate short-lists. Sen. Joseph
Lieberman _ who is clearly a long shot _ is a Democrat from
Connecticut whose presumed appeal for Al Gore lies in his
right-of-center politics, his religious commitment, and his early
condemnation of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. By
Judith Shulevitz.
</P>
<P>
   THE COSMO GIRL'S DIRTY LITTLE SECRET ISN'T SEX
</P>
<P>
   COSMO-SECRET-SLATE _ Four years after Helen Gurley Brown was
pushed out as Cosmopolitan's editor, the superannuated ``girl'' is
in the news again. She is making the media rounds to flog her new
memoir, ``I'm Wild Again.'' But on close inspection, ``I'm Wild
Again'' is a strangely inapt title and a poor description of
Brown's life. She's not wild again (and she may never have been
very wild in the first place). This is the autobiography of a
puritan. The Cosmo girl's dirty little secret isn't sex. It's work.
By David Plotz.
</P>
<P>
   `WEB' OF INTRIGUE: CIA CYBER-SPOOKS JOIN INTERNET FRENZY
</P>
<P>
   CIA-DOT.COM-INDEPENDENT _ (Los Angeles) _ It's been a long time
since espionage was cool or sexy. The end of the Cold War stole the
spooks' main reason for existing, and the Internet robbed them of
their technological chic. But now the CIA thinks it has hit upon
the ideal way to get its groove back: it is throwing caution (and
several tens of millions of dollars) to the wind, joining the
dot.com frenzy and investing in Silicon Valley. By Andrew Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   THE HI-TECH SHAKEOUT, RATTLE AND TOLL
</P>
<P>
   HITECH-SHAKEOUT-INDEPENDENT (London) _ Wednesday morning, while
walking the dog, I bumped into an old friend. ``I must ask you,''
she said, ``what you think about Bill Gates and the market. What is
going to happen?'' What, indeed. In all probability, what we are
seeing is the first stages of the high-tech shakeout. It's
equivalent to the end of the 19th century's railway boom. But the
railways still got built, and that changed the lives of humankind.
By Hamish McRae.
</P>
<P>
   YOSHIRO MORI: A MAN WITH A LOOSE MOUTH
</P>
<P>
   MORI-BIG-MOUTH-JAPAN-ASAHI (Tokyo) _ With a hefty body built up
playing rugby and his often serious demeanor, Yoshiro Mori, Japan's
acting prime minister, is often described as a man of few words. In
truth, Mori is one of the more eloquent speakers among Japanese
politicians. However, his past comments have frequently gotten him
into trouble. By Asahi News Service.
</P>
<P>
   SAD END TO THE KEIZO OBUCHI ERA
</P>
<P>
   SAD-OBUCHI-LEGACY-ASAHI (Tokyo) _ In recent weeks, Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was fond of saying, ``I have a lot of
things I want to do.'' Alas, as he remains comatose in a Tokyo
hospital following a massive stroke early Sunday, his dreams are
forever dashed. Now that the Obuchi cabinet has abruptly come to an
end, it remains to be seen how his party, the LDP, will respect his
political legacy. By Hiroshi Hoshi.
</P>
<P>
   MYSTERY, SECRECY SURROUND OBUCHI'S STROKE
</P>
<P>
   OBUCHI-`DISAPPEARED'-INDEPENDENT (Tokyo) _ Keizo Obuchi, the
comatose Japanese prime minister, disappeared for four hours after
suffering a stroke Sunday and was out of contact with his
government as aides tried desperately to cover up his critical
condition, the Independent has learned. An extraordinary sequence
of events raises more questions about the Japanese government's
capacity to handle emergencies. By Richard Lloyd Parry.
</P>
<P>
   PROPERTY RIGHTS _ AND WRONGS _ IN A WIRED WORLD
</P>
<P>
   WHO-OWNS-IDEAS?-ECONOMIST _ In Thomas Jefferson's inspiring
vision, there are no barriers to the acquisition of knowledge.
Nobody owns it, everybody partakes of it _ and the world becomes
richer. Two centuries later, when knowledge has taken over much of
the economy, Jefferson's words seem to take on a new power. These
days, ideas are capital.
</P>
<P>
   BREAK IT UP, BOYS: `WINDOWS' OF OPPORTUNITY FOR MICROSOFT
</P>
<P>
   FIXING-MICROSOFT-ECONOMIST _ It may have come as a shock to the
markets, but few others can have been surprised that Microsoft was
found guilty. A bolder and more imaginative Bill Gates would now
consider restructuring his company himself, as a better and more
creative alternative to the terrifying legal lottery that he
appears to have chosen.
</P>
<P>
   WEST'S MACHIAVELLI IS NO BETTER THAN IRAQ'S SADDAM
</P>
<P>
   RETHINK-SADDAM-ECONOMIST _ If, year in, year out, the United
Nations were systematically killing Iraqi children by airstrikes,
western governments would declare it intolerable, no matter how
noble its intention. They should find their existing policy toward
Iraq just as unacceptable. In democracies, the end does not justify
the means.
</P>
<P>
   ZIMBABWE ON A KNIFE-EDGE
</P>
<P>
   ZIMBABWE-FOLLY-ECONOMIST _ Zimbabwe is in crisis. The blame lies
almost entirely with President Robert Mugabe and his ZANU-PF, the
party that has ruled the country since it gained independence from
Britain in 1980. Mugabe has always swung between emotion and
reason. Conceivably, reason may regain the upper hand and he will
allow next month's election to be free and fair. But some nudging
will almost certainly be needed. If not, disaster will surely
ensue.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA: GOLDEN ECONOMIC PRIZE, OR RISING MENACE?
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-DEMYSTIFIED-ECONOMIST _ The West cannot quite make up its
mind about how it wants to deal with China. In America, big
business lobbies Congress to treat China as a normal trading
nation, while Congress urges the Clinton administration to sell
more weapons to Taiwan, as defense against Communist Chinese
threats. Golden economic prize (2.6 billion armpits to deodorize)
or rising international menace (those ugly threats)? Is China one
or the other? Both or neither?
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN NEEDS A NEW PRIME MINISTER WITH A MANDATE, SOON
</P>
<P>
   POST-OBUCHI-JAPAN-ECONOMIST _ After Keizo Obuchi's stroke, Japan
has had to find a new prime minister. No one, however, seems to be
looking for any other change; that, most Japanese seem to think,
can wait until after the general election, due sometime before
autumn. Alas, Japan cannot afford to be so relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX: THE NEXT SILICON VALLEY?
</P>
<P>
   DOT.COM-PHOENIX-ECONOMIST _ America's arid Southwest is
attracting people faster than any other part of the country.
Maintaining quality of life, while continuing to attract the firms
that will provide the jobs to sustain population growth at almost
three times the national rate, is a balancing act. For Phoenix, the
answer may be the Internet. After all, an industry that doesn't
need too much space, and brings in a lot of money and not too many
people, seems like a good prospect for a city that wants to slow
down a bit. Could Phoenix be the next Silicon Valley?
</P>
<P>
   JACK E., OH...: IT'S A SINNERS' RACE FOR TEDDY'S SEAT
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON-BADBOYS-SENATE-ECONOMIST _ Even in the age of negative
politics, there is something a little extraordinary, even
admirable, about Jack E. Robinson III's run for the Senate seat
that comes up for election in Massachusetts this year. In his
nine-page ``Robinson's Report,'' he reveals every skeleton in his
political closet, and is now challenging his notoriously inhibited
opponent, Sen. Ted Kennedy, to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   THE KU KLUX KLAN: STILL RIDING, WITH A BIGGER AGENDA
</P>
<P>
   KKK-ARKANSAS-ECONOMIST _ Half a century or so ago, the Ku Klux
Klan was remembered for its nocturnal cross burnings, its bombing
of black churches, its occasional murders. Now, in a new century,
it has picked up the trappings of modernity. It has an Internet
address for the ``Invisible Empire.'' And now Klansmen leave their
rallies in minivans and SUVs, not on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   THE UNCOMPROMISING POSITIONS OF RUDY GIULIANI
</P>
<P>
   RABID-RUDY-NY-ECONOMIST _ In an age when politicians seem able
to ``emote'' anything, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a
gloriously feeble actor. Assuming, that is, that Hizzoner even
bothers to try _ which he usually does not. Make a few sympathetic
comments about unarmed men killed by policemen? Not on your life,
Mister. Keep financing a museum that has annoyed you?
Fugeddabahdit. A few routine courtesies to your opponent? Whodya
think you are, lady?
</P>
<P>
   DOES DOLLARIZATION MAKE CENTS FOR EL SALVADOR?
</P>
<P>
   DOLLARIZE-ELSALVADOR?-ECONOMIST _ Will El Salvador be the next
Latin American country to adopt the dollar as its currency? On
paper, at least, El Salvador is a far more promising candidate for
dollarization that, say, Ecuador, which recently adopted the
greenback out of desperation with its own, sliding, currency.
</P>
<P>
   E-MAIL, SANS REGRETS: BEFORE YOU HIT THE `SEND' BUTTON ...
</P>
<P>
   EMAIL-`WHOOPS!'-ECONOMIST _ Who has not banged out an angry
reply to an apparently brusque e-mail message, hit the send button
_ and then regretted it? Surely no technology has led to so many
rifts and fractured friendships (not to mention subpoenas) as
electronic mail. But nowhere is e-mail more perilous than in
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN'S SOCCER-BALL INDUSTRY MENDS ITS TATTERED IMAGE
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-LABOR-PAKISTAN-ECONOMIST _ Ending child labor in Pakistan
can have unexpected consequences. In the mid-1990s, Pakistani
soccer-ball manufacturers were under attack when the western press
discovered that they were employing children for 80-hour-a-week
shifts, working for pennies in near darkness. The industry hastily
made profound changes and, three years later, child labor in
Sialkot's soccer industry is mostly history. The effects, though,
have been double-edged. Like soccer itself, getting rid of child
labor is not always a win-win game.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE THE FORBIDDEN `SECRET ROOMS' OF PORNOGRAPHIC POMPEII
</P>
<P>
   EROTIC-POMPEII-ECONOMIST _ Two and a half centuries after the
excavation which brought the ancient, destroyed cities of Pompeii
and Herculaneum to light, a collection of ``obscene objects,'' long
kept behind closed doors, is about to be opened again to the
general public. A preview of the erotic material in Naples reveals
more than anything that they are far above the standards _ as art
as well as entertainment _ of what passes for pornography today.

   BRITAIN: PUTIN TO VISIT
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Vladimir Putin will come to Britain on Sunday on
his first trip to the West since assuming power in December.
Officials at 10 Downing Street said he would spend Monday in talks
with industrialists and Prime Minister Tony Blair, who visited
Putin in St. Petersburg last month. A spokesman could not confirm
reports that the Russian would see the queen. He said the exchange
of visits underlined Britain's belief that it is better to build a
new relationship with Russia rather than isolate it over its
military campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: CHEERS!
</P>
<P>
   The government proposed new rules that would allow pubs to serve
drinks after 11 p.m. for the first time since World War I. Under
the current system, pubs have to stop selling alcohol at 11,
although customers are usually given a short grace period to finish
their drinks. The present system encourages many people to drink up
quickly before 11 and results in customers leaving en masse. This
can lead to increased drunkenness, with people ``hitting the
streets _ and sometimes each other _ at the same time,'' Home
Secretary Jack Straw said.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: PLUNDER ON THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   Germany has started an Internet Web site listing thousands of
works of art plundered by the Nazis from museums and individuals in
World War II. The site, www.lostart.de, lists unclaimed treasures
confiscated for the ``Fuehrer Museum'' that Hitler dreamed of
building in Linz, Austria. The site, with listings in German,
English and eventually Russian, allows anyone to peruse items that
may have belonged to their families. The artworks are now in
storage in government depots in Berlin or on temporary loan to
museums.

   President Ernesto Zedillo gave new backing to Tourism Minister
Oscar Espinosa, whom Mexico City prosecutors have accused of
embezzling $50 million during his time as Mexico City mayor.
Zedillo stood side by side with Espinosa at a convention as
governing party officials showered the embattled minister with
praise. ``I have the president's backing and my conscience is
clear,'' Espinosa told reporters later.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA: ISRAELI TO BE TRIED
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli judge ruled that a 19-year-old Israeli soldier can be
extradited to Canada to face murder charges. Daniel Weiz has
indicated he would go to Toronto to be tried, along with two
Canadian teen-agers, for the murder of a 15-year-old boy who in a
Toronto park on Nov. 14. Weiz, who was visiting his father, has
admitted being in the park, but has denied committing the murder.
If Weiz is convicted, Canada has agreed to send him back to Israel
to serve his sentence. Under a new Israeli law, a citizen can be
extradited only if there is a promise the sentence can be served in
Israel.

<P>
   Doctors prevented the attorney general's investigators from

Suharto has been charged with corruption during his 32-year rule.

damage the natural shield protecting the northern hemisphere from

suburbs of Baltimore represents the quintessential swing voter.
Like a lot of Americans, Cullison is following the presidential
campaign at a distance, with a keen sense of anticipatory

Christina Foley drove by, after the birth of their second child,
they saw little more than scraped earth and the gate, which was

your reach.'' They bought a lot and built a home. Then the snakes

 &HT;    Atlanta named as one of 8 markets in new U.S. women's soccer
league
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta was announced Monday as one of eight markets
slated to receive a franchise in a new professional women's soccer
league. Now, the team has to find a place to play when the league
starts in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's United Soccer Association, which has signed every
member of the 1999 U.S. Women's World Cup championship team, also
announced that Atlanta-based Turner Sports Inc. purchased rights
for a national television package.
</P>
<P>
   The package consists of 22 games on Turner Network Television
and CNN/Sports Illustrated, an all-sports news cable outlet, in
each of the first four years.
</P>
<P>
   The local investment group, Cox Enterprises Inc. _ the parent
company of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution _ has had numerous
discussions with Atlanta soccer leaders and team officials in
recent weeks but is just starting to explore serious prospects for
a venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we know the markets, the legwork has to be done,''
Cox Enterprises spokeswoman Colleen Brannan said. ``There are such
a variety of options (for venues) here. I don't think we're there
yet (in choosing one).''
</P>
<P>
   Alternate cities are Chicago, Columbus, Ohio, Detroit, Los
Angeles, Miami, Portland, Ore., Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The first season requires minimum seating of 5,000. In Atlanta,
that number probably means play in a high school stadium, at least
in the beginning. One possibility is DeKalb Memorial Stadium, where
the A-League Atlanta Silverbacks begin their second season
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some good conversations (with Cox Enterprises),''
Silverbacks President Paul Sabiston said. ``We'd love to see a
women's professional league. We're trying to reach the same market.
You've got to work hard on your core base of fans. You just can't
put a soccer ball on a billboard and say: Hey, we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   One component of the planned Atlanta Soccer Village complex,
which was unveiled almost a year ago and which would be located in
or near Stone Mountain Park, would include a 5,000-seat stadium.
Project manager Amanda Brown-Olmstead would not elaborate on her
discussions with Cox Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a lot of possibilities,'' she said. ``I hope
the WUSA team does become part of the Atlanta Soccer Village.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Olmstead said funding has not been raised for such a
facility because there is no tenant, but she was optimistic
something could be constructed quickly, if necessary. Two years
ago, the Charleston Battery, an A-League rival of the Silverbacks,
built a 5,200-seat facility in four months.
</P>
<P>
   TNT will air 15 women's pro soccer games each season, and seven
will be on CNN/SI, according to Turner Sports President Mark
Lazarus. The two networks have a mostly male viewership, while the
interest in women's soccer, judging from the World Cup, is upscale,
suburban and family-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't consider family viewing (to be) niche,'' Lazarus
said. ``We consider it pretty widespread. At its very core, this
product is about families.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer has expressed an interest in putting
together a rival bid for a women's league. The deadline is May 1
for the bid to be submitted to the U.S. Soccer Federation, which is
the sanctioning power.
</P>
<P>
   But WUSA officials and top U.S. players don't want any part of
it, unless it is for cross-promotional purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the most important thing is that we want the focus to
be on women's soccer,'' midfielder Julie Foudy said. ``We will play
only for the WUSA.''
</P>
<P>
   OTHER FRANCHISES
</P>
<P>
   Other markets awarded initial franchises are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Boston
</P>
<P>
   _ New York
</P>
<P>
   _ Philadelphia
</P>
<P>
   _ Orlando-Tampa, Fla.

ALBEE PLAY WILL HAVE U.S. PREMIERE IN HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVERETT EVANS 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ An artist's creations often are called his children,
so it's more than a pun to announce that playwright Edward Albee
has a new baby _ ``The Play About the Baby,'' whose U.S. premiere
the Alley Theatre of Houston will present Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright is directing the four-person cast, which includes
Marian Seldes and Earle Hyman, two of American theater's most
distinguished actors.
</P>
<P>
   Albee wants the almost-new arrival to be judged on its merits,
despite the inevitable urge to compare it to ``The Zoo Story,''
``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' and his three Pulitzer Prize
winners, ``A Delicate Balance,'' ``Seascape'' and ``Three Tall
Women.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wishes to reveal little about the play's content,
preferring to surprise playgoers with its twists and mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   The basic ingredients are: a young couple, identified as Boy and
Girl, who have just had a baby, and a mature pair, called Man and
Woman, who intrude and draw the young duo into games of control,
raising questions about who will keep the baby _ and whether, in
fact, it exists.
</P>
<P>
   Even from that bare-bones summary one recognizes Albee musing on
themes that have long concerned him. ``Virginia Woolf'' features
older and younger couples in a clash of gamesmanship, as well as a
child whose existence is called into question. Several other plays
explore parenthood and identity, including the satirical ``The
American Dream.'' Mysterious visitors are a recurring element,
notably in ``Seascape'' and ``The Lady From Dubuque.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage at the Alley, Albee exudes an air of relaxed
confidence. Despite the echoes of his earlier plays, he maintains
that this ``Baby'' has an identity all its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its genesis, its harks back to `The Lady From Dubuque,'''
Albee says. ``What it shares with that play is the theme of how
much of our reality is determined by what we need.'' In
``Dubuque,'' the title character arrives unbidden at the home of a
dying woman. Initially a cause of bewilderment, she ultimately
proves a source of consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Play About the Baby'' had its world premiere at London's
Almeida Theatre in September 1998, directed by Howard Davies, who
also directed last season's acclaimed Broadway revival of ``The
Iceman Cometh.'' ``Baby'' drew mixed reviews, with some critics
complaining that the playwright had recycled ideas. Yet it found
enthusiastic supporters, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very fond of the London production,'' Albee says. ``It
was beautifully directed and beautifully acted. I'm grateful to
Howard Davies, because I learned a lot about the play from working
with him.'' The stars were Frances de la Tour and Alan Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Albee's one quibble was with the setting, which he found ``too
specific.'' ``Baby'' calls for a spare, abstract set. E. David
Cosier's model for the Houston production is virtually a bare
stage, slightly modified. The Houston design team _ Cosier, costume
designer Teresa Snider-Stein and lighting designer Jeffrey Koger _
also did the 1994 all-Albee season at New York's Signature Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   There were plans to move the London ``Baby'' to New York last
season, but Albee felt an American play needed American actors.
When the desired actors were unavailable, New York plans fell
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted with the cast we have here,'' he says. ``If this
is as effective a production as I think it is, we may go to New
York next fall.''
</P>
<P>
   David Burtka and Rebecca Harris, both with recent off-Broadway
credits, play the young couple.
</P>
<P>
   Albee is still ``tinkering'' with the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ending I'd originally written, which I (deleted from) the
London production, I am restoring here. It's just a moment, a final
visual metaphor. I'm clarifying some things and confusing others.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs. ``I never try to be obscure, really never write to
obfuscate. That would be perverse, in the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   The publication last year of the first Albee biography, Mel
Gussow's ``Edward Albee: A Singular Journey,'' offered readers a
deeper understanding of the wellsprings of Albee's writing. He was
an adopted child, raised by wealthy but distant parents, which
perhaps explains his lifelong fascination with parenting and
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I approached 70, I knew someone would be doing a book. I
thought better it should be Mel Gussow (who has covered Albee since
the 1962 premiere of `Virginia Woolf') rather than someone
unfamiliar with my work. I had no problem with the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mel first approached me, I told him the one thing I
didn't want him to do too much of was to relate every single thing
that happened in my life to the content of my plays. But naturally,
whenever he found the opportunities, he played detective and made
those connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want anyone getting the idea I've just been
putting my life onstage. I invent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I read that book like an adventure story,'' Albee
says. ``I was wondering what would happen next. Frankly, I'd
forgotten a lot. And then, as I read, I remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Albee is working on his next play, ``Who Is Sylvia?'' He says it
is ``about the limits of our tolerance'' and will be ``funny, cruel
and brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Hartford (Conn.) Stage Company's acclaimed
production of his ``Tiny Alice'' is scheduled to go to New York
next season. And this fall, Albee will teach a course in theater
criticism at Baruch College in New York. He has taught playwriting
at the University of Houston each spring since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In his writing and his personal manner, Albee in recent years
seems to have evolved, as one critic noted in his review of
``Baby,'' ``from angry young man to rueful older one.'' With his
prizes, several works regarded as modern classics and the renewed
appreciation of recent seasons, perhaps it was inevitable that the
bad boy of American drama would mellow into one of its senior
statesmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've mellowed,'' he responds, as if mildly
affronted. ``I still have many of the same angers. I've just gotten
more experienced talking to journalists. With this next play, I
feel I might even be thrown out of the country.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Teen's mother to sue operators of Texas youth home
 &HT;    By Leon Stafford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The mother of a Conyers boy who alleges he was abused
at a Texas youth home says she will file a civil lawsuit against
the operators of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Calalay said she sent her son, Justin Simons, 18, to the
People's Baptist Church-run facility in Corpus Christi to be
``given structure in a Christian environment with Christian
values.'' The home is for troubled young boys, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said she brought her son back this month bruised,
beaten and barely able to walk because of an alleged forced jump
over a 15-foot-deep open pit.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies in Nueces County, Texas, on Friday arrested two men
connected with the facility. Allen Smith was charged with unlawful
restraint, a third-degree felony, and was released on a $10,000
bond. Wiley Cameron Sr., pastor of the church, was arrested after
he refused to turn over records that had been sought by
investigators. An attorney representing Cameron later agreed to
hand over the records and Cameron was released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said more arrests may come.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the facility were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the parents thought they were trusting their children
with people with special credentials and all they offered was
violence,'' said Marcus Davis, Calalay's attorney. Calalay said she
plans to go to Corpus Christi this week to meet with police about
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Since making the allegations public last week, Calalay said
about seven other boys from around the country have come forward
with similar stories, including Ricky Mason, 17, of Locust Grove.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Simons alleges that the abuse started the second day he
was at the home, where he stayed March 12 through March 31. He said
he heard and saw people beaten with sticks and later was a victim
of the attacks. At one point, he said he was bound to another boy
and forced to run as fast as he could with the threat of being
beaten hanging over his head. He said he and another teen were
thrown in the pit _ which captured refuse and waste from the
facility _ after Simons failed to inform the home's authorities
that the other boy was planning to run away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see the place shut down,'' Simons said. ``I want to
see all the guys out of there who are getting brainwashed. It's a
bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason, 17, said Monday that he went to the home on March 7 and
was pleased at first. But the second week into his almost
month-long stay, he said he was pushed for ``slacking off'' and
told that his fingers would be broken if he did not sign a form
releasing the group from liability should he be injured while in
their care.
</P>
<P>
   Both boys said Monday they are having nightmares, don't like
being alone and have had trouble eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not one doubt in my mind that this is the truth,''
Theresa Calalay said.

GORE'S MOTHER IS HONORED WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Ohio)   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ In an event seamlessly meshing the personal
and the political, Pauline LaFon Gore, the mother of Vice President
Al Gore, received her bachelor's degree Monday from Union
University, the tiny Baptist college in western Tennessee that she
left two years shy of finishing her course work in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   And as she listened on, her son, the presumptive Democratic
nominee for president, headlined the ceremony with a speech that
was part tribute to his mother's powerful influence, and part paean
to ambitious women everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``She grew up in a time when poor girls were not supposed to
dream,'' Gore told the audience at the exclusive Nashville City
Club. ``What motivated my mother to strive was not the dream of
money at all, but the dream of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore described his mother, who is 87, as being quietly motivated
by the stories of women from her mother's generation who were not
allowed to inherit land. She not only put herself through college
by waiting tables, she also took notes and read assignments for her
blind sister, Thelma.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, students were allowed to attend law school
without receiving a bachelor's degree, so she quit Union to enroll
at Vanderbilt University Law School in Nashville, where she became
one of the first women graduates, in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, she married another law school graduate, Al
Gore Sr., who later became a Democratic congressman and senator
from Tennessee. He died in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, the vice president credited his mother with
coining the memorable slogan that he says helped his father defeat
a powerful incumbent, Sen. Kenneth McKeller, in 1952. Below every
sign that carried McKeller's slogan, ``The thinking feller votes
McKeller,'' the Gore campaign posted a sign that read, ``Think some
more and vote for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his mother's role as a campaign adviser for him and
his father, Gore told the story of a long-time supporter of his
father who told his mother, ``If your son is as good as his old
man, I'll be for him.'' To which his mother replied, ``Well, I
trained them both, and I did a better job on my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she has been severely weakened by a heart attack and
stroke, Mrs. Gore was alert enough Monday to gasp when her son
inadvertently revealed her age by discussing her 80th birthday
party seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president credited his mother with helping to end
gender discrimination at the Nashville City Club, asserting that
the club first began admitting women shortly after his mother was
thrown out of the dining room after trying to dine there with a
male friend in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also used his speech to praise his father as an example of
a Southern progressive who supported civil rights, opposed the
Vietnam War and was an early advocate of campaign finance reform _
an issue Gore is trying to champion in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``She shared his conscience,'' he said of his parents. ``In all
things large and small, she was his strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said Mrs. Gore, whose only remarks were a brief
thanks to the university, was the second person in the college's
history to be awarded a bachelor's degree without having completed
the required course work.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Later in the day, Gore traveled to Dayton, Ohio, where he held a
town meeting with about 200 undecided voters, his first such event
in nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio is considered a battleground state. President Clinton and
Gore won the state in 1996. But recent polls show Gore trailing
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first questions Gore was asked at the town meeting
was whether he would shut down a hazardous waste incinerator in
East Liverpool, Ohio. In 1992, Gore vowed to block the incinerator,
but it has remained open, infuriating environmentalists around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Gore blamed the Bush administration for issuing,
during its final days, a permit to test the incinerator, leaving
the Clinton administration, he claimed, few options to shut it
down.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Elian Gonzalez, Gore offered yet another shading of
his position. Reaffirming his support for having a family court
decide the custody battle, Gore added that he thought the boy's
Cuban father and American relatives should meet to resolve the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, with tensions as high as they are, and both
sides trying to reach a solution, we need to encourage the talks
between the family members themselves,'' he said. ``Because that's
the ideal solution.''

MARKETPLACE: STILL WAITING AT STANLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Stanley Works may tell investors about the need to be
patient, but the company's chief executive appears to have failed
to heed the same advice.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after John M. Trani, a rising star at General
Electric, took over as chief executive of Stanley Works, investors
are still looking for some of the GE management magic. For his
efforts, though, Trani pulled a sizable pay increase out of his
company last year.
</P>
<P>
   Trani, who had an impressive performance at GE's medical systems
division, was greeted with much enthusiasm when he took over
Stanley at the end of 1996. The stock rose by nearly a third during
the month after his arrival to top $39 a share.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to take Stanley's popular brand of tools and
hardware to new heights _ and profitability. Based in New Britain,
Conn., Stanley had not been as aggressive as it could have been in
slashing costs and searching out new markets. The new chief
executive boasted to Wall Street that Stanley would eventually be
able to grow at twice the industry's average rate.
</P>
<P>
   But the much-anticipated revival has yet to take place, despite
the boom in the home improvement market. Since 1996, the company's
annual revenues have remained essentially flat at about $2.7
billion. The company's ``core'' earnings, which it considers a more
telling indicator of its true profitability, dipped slightly last
year to $2.06 a share and are below what they were in 1997. The
stock, which peaked at $57.25 in early 1998, is now trading about
where it was when Trani initially became chief executive. While the
company's peer group has trailed the overall market since 1997,
Stanley's stock has lagged behind that of such competitors as Black
&AMP; Decker. It closed Monday at $26.125.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are disappointed. ``I think, generally, people are
very impatient,'' said Kevin Grant, one of the portfolio managers
for the Oakmark Fund and a Stanley shareholder. Despite Trani's
rhetoric, the task of bringing operating discipline and greater
ambition to Stanley has proved much harder than predicted, he said.
Trani ``has had to spend almost two years getting to know what he
has,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that the process of remaking Stanley has been a
difficult one. ``The last three years have been trying times, to
say the least,'' acknowledged James C. Lucas, an analyst with
Janney Montgomery Scott. ``Stanley Works is not going through a
restructuring, it is going through a re-creation process. It really
is a five-year process.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts and investors say that Trani has taken too
long to strengthen the company's management team. Only last year,
for example, did he hire James M. Loree, a former finance executive
at a unit of GE Capital, as the company's new chief financial
officer. ``These are people who should have been brought into
Stanley in 1997,'' said David R. Giroux, an analyst for T. Rowe
Price, a mutual fund company that is a large investor in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   And while they applaud Trani's efforts to reorganize the
company, they say that some of his initial attempts were not
entirely successful. Over the last few years, the company has had
various manufacturing inefficiencies and difficulty serving some of
its key customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, while acknowledging its own frustration with the
pace of its progress, argues that significant steps have been taken
that will eventually help the company achieve its goals of
improving revenues and earnings. ``You have to take a long-term
view,'' said Vance N. Meyer, a spokesman for Stanley Works. ``There
are a lot of seeds being planted.''
</P>
<P>
   Trani has streamlined the company into a much more efficient
producer of tools and hardware. He has significantly concentrated
the company's product line on best sellers and brought some badly
need innovation to Stanley. The company has introduced hundreds of
new products, ranging from a new 25-foot tape rule to a
high-tension hacksaw that has been praised for its design.
</P>
<P>
   There are some early positive signs. During the second half of
1999, the company was better able to fill the orders of some key
customers. Revenues gained 2 percent, and operating cash flow
increased to $222 million. ``The worst is probably behind Stanley
works,'' Giroux said.
</P>
<P>
   But while he and other shareholders are still waiting for
concrete improvement in revenues and earnings, Trani is already
reaping substantial rewards. While some of his compensation is tied
directly to the company's stock, he was awarded about $4 million in
cash last year, according to Stanley's proxy statement, the result
of a higher bonus and substantial payout from the company's
longer-term performance plan.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Trani's compensation was his yearly salary and
bonus, some $2.3 million, $500,000 more than he was paid in 1998
and in 1997. The performance plan kicked in the other $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although the board considered some of the factors cited in the
proxy statement, like core earnings, in considering Trani's
compensation last year, it also considered other aspects of
Stanley's operating performance, like the introduction of new
products and improved cash flow, according to Meyer, the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Only investors will have to wait to see if these early
indications are really a sign of a new and improved Stanley Works.

<P>
   SHENYANG, China _ For urban Chinese who are middle-aged and
beyond, the old ``neighborhood committees'' that watched over every
household are among the more obnoxious memories of the early
decades of communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Staffed, as lore has it, by one's nosiest neighbors, the
committees were empowered to scrutinize every visitor, report every
antisocial activity and even monitor pregnancies. On the more
positive side, they also sorted out neighborly disputes, watched
out for burglars or fallen power lines, and sometimes even ran
convenient food shops.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years, with the decline of Marxist fervor and
the emergence of a more diverse society, the committees waned but
they never quite disappeared, continuing to organize retirees into
``neighborhood watch'' patrols and still keeping careful track of
all local residents.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with experiments in Shenyang and 19 other cities, the
government is trying to reinvent this venerable institution.
</P>
<P>
   Cities are replacing the legendary ``seven grannies with eight
teeth between them'' with more professional, somewhat younger
staffs that can link up citizens up with vital social services like
finding help for isolated elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are driven, officials say, by the rapid decay of the
old ``work unit'' system, in which state industries and other
employers guaranteed a lifetime income, housing, medical care and
other benefits to their workers. As such enterprises shut down and
their social services evaporate, the plan is for the newly
invigorated neighborhood committees to take up part of the slack.
</P>
<P>
   A more basic if perhaps quixotic hope these days is to put the
Communist Party back in touch with common people. And while no one
says it out loud, the authorities also want to save these
street-level organizations to help keep tabs on an increasingly
mobile and independent population _ reporting on, for example, the
presence of illegal rural migrants or stubborn followers of a
banned sect.
</P>
<P>
   Shenyang, a former bastion of socialist industry better known
lately for its eerie vistas of idle smokestacks and protests by
unpaid workers, aims to be on the cutting edge of this new
neighborhood movement. In this reeling northeastern city, officials
are even boasting of a new ``grass-roots democracy,'' using local
elections to select ``community administrative committee'' leaders
on the theory that this will energize citizens and improve services
like job training, garbage collection and care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our goals is to return power to the people,'' Liang
Wanfu, deputy chief of the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau, said in
an interview. ``In the past the role of the Communist Party was to
take care of the people, but now it has to let the people take care
of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Lofty words aside, the new elections are also firmly intended to
promote party loyalists, it was apparent on a recent visit to one
of the city's model new community groups.
</P>
<P>
   Though the city's energetic mayor, Mu Xuexin, has described the
neighborhood policy as an unavoidable response to the city's
economic woes, the changes have hardly begun in the city's most
stricken district, Tiexin, once the epicenter of heavy industry and
now littered with rusting state factories. A sampling of residents
there found many who were skeptical, to the extent they were at all
aware of the city's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiexin has become like a holiday village, nobody works here
any more,'' said Yao, who was laid off from a military uniform
factory. Actually, many are working but for themselves, crowded
along Tiexin's sidewalks hawking snacks, cigarettes or underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Yao contended that a job-training center promoted by his local
committee was a sham. ``What jobs are they going to train us for,
anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   In a more prosperous neighborhood nearby, private businessmen
living in one of the city's finer apartment buildings said they
knew of the new system and had even attended meetings. Some said
that such committees were considerably less relevant to their lives
than, say, apartment management companies or private businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A more generous assessment, and a glimpse at how officials hope
the new structure can help citizens, came from Wang Qiang, 34, the
owner of an electronics factory. He said he had been invited to
join an advisory group of the newly elected committee near his
factory site and had already benefited.
</P>
<P>
   When he told the group that his biggest problem was trying to
get a loan, he said, they put him in touch with a city technology
board, which arranged for a low-interest loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to expand my company and hire more workers,'' he
said. ``This was very useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Shenyang, in line with the strategy across urban China, has
redrawn its old neighborhood maps, creating community districts
that cover larger areas than before, now averaging 1,264 households
each. Each ``community'' has an elected administrative committee of
six or so people whose jobs are to promote hygiene, cultural
events, family planning, crime control and economic development and
to deal with citizen complaints. They are paid modestly and have no
independent powers or budget, but rather are meant to act as
liaisons with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Shenyang officials say that with their new neighborhood
elections they are creating the urban equivalent of the village
elections now held in most of rural China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that the grass-roots organizations were actually
the `feet' of the government, just following where they were told
to go,'' said Liang, the city official. ``Now these local
organizations have to becomes the heads, guiding change.''

SUPREME COURT DECISIONS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, slower than many courts to enter
the age of online information, announced on Monday that it would
inaugurate its own Web site next Monday. The address is
www.supremecourtus.gov.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decisions will be available on the site within hours
of their 10 a.m. release, through a link to a site run by the
Government Printing Office. Later on the day of release, the
court's own site will make the opinions directly available.
</P>
<P>
   Other information to be available on the Web site includes the
weekly orders granting and denying new appeals; the court's
schedule and argument calendar; the court's rules; bar admission
forms and instructions; visitors' guides; news releases, and
general information, like biographies of the justices.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Arberg, the court's public information officer, said that
in the near future the court's docket would be available on the Web
site, enabling people to check the status of current cases and the
disposition of past cases. For the last four years, this
information has been available on a dial-up bulletin board system,
which will be shut down. Callers will still be able to obtain the
status of cases through the Clerk's Automated Response System at
(202) 479-3034.
</P>
<P>
   The court will also continue to maintain a system it calls
Project Hermes, under which 17 subscribers, including commercial
databases, universities, The Associated Press and The New York
Times, receive immediate computerized access to opinions, for
retransmission to their own users and subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Many state courts and most of the federal appeals courts either
have their own Web sites or post their decisions under special
arrangement with Web sites maintained by law schools within their
jurisdiction. The federal judiciary maintains its own Web site, at
www.uscourts.gov.

 &HT;    `Flight to quality' in markets examined
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't panic. What's happening in the stock market is
that investors are simply looking for quality. That's the way
Business Week (April 17) explains what happened on Wall Street last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Among the week's highlights was April 4, ``the most volatile day
in the history of the stock market,'' when the Dow Jones industrial
average and the Nasdaq composite each plummeted more than 500
points before staging a remarkable recovery.
</P>
<P>
   What happened was not so much a change of investor interest from
``new economy'' stocks to ``old economy'' stocks, but ``a flight to
quality across the entire equity spectrum,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   The two most famous indexes, which had been separatedly widely
since late last year, started moving closer together recently when
investors shunned technology stocks _ which they had been buying
pell-mell _ and turned to brick-and-mortar blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can only be healthy for the market,'' Business Week says.
``For the last year and a half, the stock market has become a
market of extremes: extremely high valuations for the `new economy'
denizens that dominate the Nasdaq _and extremely low valuations for
anything that smacked of the `old economy.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, and especially the last few days, the
market tried to correct those extremes. And true to Wall Street's
form, the shift took place in a violent way.
</P>
<P>
   EXTREMELY DIFFERENT BOARDS
</P>
<P>
   The difference between a good board of directors and a bad board
is that the latter will show its flaws soon enough, but the former
may do its job so well no one really knows how they do it.
</P>
<P>
   So says Fortune (April 17), which identifies today's four best
boards and the six worst. Among the best is Atlanta-based Home
Depot, whose requirements include each director visiting at least
20 stores each year.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric, Intel and Texas Instruments also have ``best''
boards.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune says its annual survey of institutional investors,
investor advisory firms and shareholder rights advocates came up
with the six worst boards: Advanced Micro Devices, Archer Daniels
Midland, Maxxam, Ogden, Rite Aid and Warnaco.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, this is the magazine's Fortune 500 edition, the
results of which have already been published.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH MENTIONING ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Money (April) and Mutual Funds (May) offer articles on
retirement planning and investment strategies aimed at early
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Technology Investor (May) credits Atlanta-based
Healtheon/WebMD for trying ``to streamline the economy's
least-efficient sector'' _ health care.
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual Investor (April) looks at ``indexmania,'' or the
growing reliance on mutual funds indexed to one of the many stock
market averages.

EXPERTS QUESTION VALUE OF SUPPLEMENTS FOR VITAMINS C AND E 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y.)   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though millions of Americans take vitamins C and E and
other antioxidants in hopes of warding off illness and aging, a
report being issued Tuesday by nutrition experts says there is no
evidence that the large doses that have become popular can prevent
chronic disease or that most Americans need to take supplements at
all.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, large doses of vitamins C and E and selenium can be
harmful, according to the new report by the Institute of Medicine,
a branch of the National Academy of Sciences. Because of concerns
about toxicity, for the first time, the institute set upper limits
for the nutrients and emphasized that most Americans already got
enough of the nutrients from the food they ate.
</P>
<P>
   There has been great interest in antioxidants in recent years
because studies have hinted that they may play a role in disease
prevention. Antioxidants counteract the adverse effects in the body
of highly reactive forms of oxygen and nitrogen, known as free
radicals, which accumulate from normal metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Free radicals can damage cells and are thought by some
scientists to contribute to aging, cancer, cardiovascular disease,
eye problems like cataracts and macular degeneration, Alzheimer's
disease, Parkinson's disease and some complications of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors of the institute report, directed by Dr. Norman
Krinsky of the department of biochemistry at Tufts University in
Boston, could not find convincing evidence that taking vitamins or
selenium would help prevent any of those diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Although many studies have shown that people who eat diets rich
in fruits and vegetables have a lower risk of many types of cancer,
the studies could not pinpoint particular nutrients as providing
the benefit, and many researchers believe that fruits and
vegetables contain other substances, as yet unidentified, that may
have important effects on health.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were similar for heart disease. Although one study
did find a benefit from vitamin E supplements, three others found
it made no difference.
</P>
<P>
   For cataracts, studies did show a lower risk in people who had
higher blood levels of antioxidants. But the studies did not
convince the panel that supplements could prevent cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   For macular degeneration, studies have shown a lower risk in
people who eat large amounts of fruits and vegetables, but cause
and effect have not been proved, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth Ayoob, a pediatric nutritionist at Einstein Medical
Center in New York and a spokesman for the American Dietetic
Association, said the report seemed to suggest ``a lot of power in
food.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot more data on food than we do on supplements and
maybe food is where we ought to put our attention,'' Dr. Ayoob
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the panel recommended small increases in the
recommended daily intake of vitamins C and E, which can be obtained
through a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   For vitamin C, the group recommended that women consume 75
milligrams per day, and men 90 milligrams. Smokers need 35
milligrams more than nonsmokers. Vitamin C is plentiful in citrus
fruit, potatoes, strawberries, broccoli and leafy green vegetables.
But for those who take supplements, no one should take more than
2,000 milligrams of vitamin C a day, the report said, because it
can cause diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   For vitamin E, the recommended intake for both men and women is
15 milligrams, or 22 International Units, or I.U., of alpha
tocopherol. Vitamin E is found in nuts, seeds, liver, whole grains
and leafy vegetables. The upper limit for vitamin E, which a person
could achieve only by taking supplements, is 1,500 I.U. if the
product is ``d-alpha tocopherol,'' or 1,100 I.U. if the product is
``dl-alpha-tocopherol,'' a synthetic version of the vitamin. Higher
amounts could lead to hemorrhaging, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   For selenium, the recommended intake for both men and women is
55 micrograms per day. Selenium is found in brazil nuts, seafood,
garlic, liver, meat and grains.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 micrograms a day can cause a disorder called
selenosis, which causes loss of hair and fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   The report also considered the antioxidants known as
carotenoids, including beta carotene, which is converted into
vitamin A in the body. But the panel said there was not enough
evidence to recommend a daily intake or set upper limits. The only
people in need of supplements would be those with vitamin A
deficiencies, which are uncommon.

RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS EDGING TOWARD ARMS-CONTROL PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the first major test of a new and more centrist
parliamentary majority in Russia, President-elect Vladimir Putin
reached agreement Monday with his legislative allies to bring a
long-delayed nuclear arms reduction treaty to a ratification vote
in parliament as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of ratifying the treaty, known as START II, predicted
that they had the votes to win. The decision to move forward
immediately with the vote in the wake of Putin's victory in last
month's presidential election was hailed as a significant advance
of the arms control agenda here, one that had been blocked for five
years by a Communist-led coalition that dominated the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But with the victory in December of liberal and centrist
parties, who won a majority of the 450 seats in the Russian Duma,
or parliament, a strong ratification vote would also demonstrate
the political realignment that is taking shape in Russian politics
as Putin is preparing to undertake a new phase of economic reforms
for which he will need strong parliamentary backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential elections have given us a good chance to be
guided by Russia's interests and not to look back at internal
problems and engage in politicking,'' said Sergei Ivanov, the
director of Russia's national security council under Putin, after a
meeting of the advisory body in the Kremlin Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A number of legislative leaders here, as well as senior members
of the Clinton administration, have been urging Moscow to vote on
the treaty before Putin is sworn in on May 7. Last Friday in
Washington, Strobe Talbott, a deputy secretary of state, was quoted
by Reuters as saying, ``The Russians continue to assure us,
including in the last 24 hours, that the process for ratifying
START II in the Duma is under way.''
</P>
<P>
   But with all the prodding, it appeared that Putin decided to
test his strength in the Duma only after it was clear from
legislative leaders that a majority would support ratification.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty is still likely to be opposed by Communist deputies.
The Communist Party's leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, in a televised
interview Monday night, reiterated his view that the treaty ``in
its current state is absolutely defective'' and would destroy
``Russia's most important nuclear missile umbrella'' at a time when
Russian lacked the budget resources to maintain a strategic missile
force as large as that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They propose to destroy our missiles, while mass production of
new ones has not started and there is no money for it,'' Zyuganov
said.
</P>
<P>
   But another legislative leader, Vladimir Lukin, a member of the
reformist Yabloko faction and a former ambassador to the United
States, said he did not believe the Communists would be able to
muster more than 150 votes if they opposed ratification. ``So it
seems that a majority is being hammered together,'' he said, adding
that the chances for ratification are ``rather high.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the ratification of the seven-year-old treaty is
the least contentious item on the arms control agenda. A more
heated debate lies ahead in START III negotiations, in which Moscow
is seeking deeper cuts in strategic arsenals, in part because it
can no longer afford a large array of strategic weapons, and where
Washington is seeking Russian acceptance for American plans to
build an anti-ballistic missile shield over the United States to
protect it from ``rogue states'' and accidental launches.
</P>
<P>
   These plans have aroused deep concerns here and in China that
the United States will ultimately destabilize the strategic balance
by having both a shield against nuclear missiles and the most
robust offensive nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Moscow warned that it remained opposed to American
plans to build a national missile defense system that would
undermine the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov, meeting with American businessmen and
journalists Monday, said, ``The collapse of the 1972 ABM Treaty
would cast the world into a new confrontation.'' He added that an
American decision to abrogate the treaty would undermine relations
between Moscow and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climate in which our economic cooperation develops depends
to a large extent on the long-term resolution of issues related to
strategic stability,'' Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitri Rogozin, chairman of the Duma's international affairs
committee, said ratification of the START II treaty and its
extensions agreed to in 1997 provided ``an opportunity to keep the
Americans from quitting the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   The START II treaty, negotiated in the last year of the Bush
administration, commits the United States and Russia to reduce
their nuclear arsenals to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each
from about 6,000. One milestone of the accord is a ban on
land-based missiles with multiple warheads. American arms control
negotiators have long sought the elimination of these systems, most
notably the heavy Russian SS-18 rockets with 10 warheads each. The
destruction of missiles and warheads was to be carried out by 2003,
but in the absence of ratification, the two sides agreed to
deactivate the affected missiles by that date and carry out
destruction by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Boris Yeltsin failed repeatedly to bring the
treaty to a vote in 1996 and 1997. In late 1998, as the
Communist-led Duma prepared to debate the accord, American and
British air strikes on Iraq caused a delay. The Clinton
administration's announcement last year that it intended to seek
amendments to the ABM treaty resulted in another delay. In March
1999, Duma leaders said they would debate and vote on the measure
the following month, but consideration was postponed again with the
onset of NATO's air campaign in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The committees on defense and international affairs both
recommended ratification Monday in closed-door meetings and the
speaker of the parliament, Gennadi Selezynov, said the Duma
Council, consisting of leaders of all factions, would meet on
Tuesday to set the final schedule for the debate and vote.

EASY-ACCESS BEACHES  
 VISITING SHEIKDOMS  
 BERMUDA DOLPHINS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Questions may be italicized)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have had two knee replacements and use a cane, and I have
difficulty getting into and out of the water at the beach unless
there is something for me to hold on to. Do you know of any
Caribbean beaches with a pier going into the water or some other
kind of railing or steps that would put me into deep water? _ Alvin
V. Hart, New York, N.Y. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Mar Sin Barreras (Sea Without Barriers) is in Puerto Rico at
Luquillo Beach on the northeast end of the island. There, you will
find a ramp going into the ocean. The beach also has special life
preservers for guests with disabilities and staff to assist you, if
you need it. For beachgoers who need a wheelchair, Mar Sin Barreras
also has specially designed beach wheelchairs. Toilet and shower
facilities are also designed to be accessible. Information: (787)
889-4329. A similar project is under construction at Boqueron, on
the southwest part of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility you might consider is to go snorkeling or
swimming on a dive boat. Red Sail Sports, www.redsail.com, with
centers in Aruba, (011-297) 861603 and the Cayman Islands, (345)
945-5965, has experience with clients who have limited mobility.
Rod McDowell, with the company's Cayman Islands office, said that
you could take a half-day boat trip, with access into the water by
ladder, for $65, with lunch.
</P>
<P>
   At Divibonaire, www.divibonaire.com, (800) 661-3483, there's a
dock with steps leading into the water. It is at the Divi Flamingo
Beach Resort on Bonaire, and it is free. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last spring, I read about a prince from the United Arab
Emirates who had entered a horse in the Kentucky Derby. His country
was described as a tourism destination, with luxury hotels and
beautiful bazaars. How accessible is it for an American? _ Marie
Anderson, Pensacola, Fla. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The United Arab Emirates, on the Arabian Gulf between Saudi
Arabia and Oman, is a union of seven sheikdoms formed in 1971 when
the British left the Gulf. The largest _ Abu Dhabi _ is about
26,000 square miles; the smallest, Ajman, is about 100 square
miles. Of all the Persian Gulf states, the United Arab Emirates has
some of the best tourism infrastructure and the most relaxed entry
rules, and English is widely understood.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to visit is November through March. At other
times, it can be extremely hot and humid. Ramadan, the month when
Muslims fast from sunrise to sundown, is another period you might
wish to avoid; the dates vary.
</P>
<P>
   Americans need a visa (issued for two weeks to three months),
obtained through a United Arab Emirates Embassy. Applicants will
also be asked to submit documentation of travel plans, which can
include a hotel reservation; often, the hotel you are staying at
can help.
</P>
<P>
   Contact the Embassy of the United Arab Emirates, Suite 700, 1255
22nd Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20037; (202) 955-7999, fax (202)
333-3246. Call between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. Monday to Friday. Visas
cost $51.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors should dress modestly. Although women do not have to
cover their heads with scarves, tight jeans and skirts above the
knee are not advisable.
</P>
<P>
   According to the State Department, there is relatively little
crime. The biggest danger is driving, and since a rental car is the
most convenient way to get around, the risks should not be taken
lightly. Traffic accidents are a leading cause of death, with
reckless driving, wandering camels, unmarked speed bumps, dust
storms and flash floods (particularly November through January) the
major hazards.
</P>
<P>
   The country's telecommunications, roads, hospitals and other
infrastructure are modern and well-maintained. The landscape is
varied, from the Hajar Mountains in the east to vast deserts to
beaches. Abu Dhabi, the capital city, and Dubai, farther north
along the coast, have 21st-century skylines concealing ancient
souks. Dubai has more night life and better air access, and is the
best base for exploring the emirates.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours' drive from either Abu Dhabi or Dubai are Al Ain
and Buraimi, an oasis on the Oman border with an interesting
museum, livestock and camel souks and forts (and the country's
largest skating rink). The Liwa Oasis, on the southern edge of the
emirates, is a popular getaway for its desert scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Dubai is an easygoing city, with colorful souks and boat rides
on Dubai Creek. The Dubai Museum occupies the 19th-century Al
Fahaidi Fort, with exhibits on desert life, culture and weaponry.
The gold souk is also fun to explore. The best beaches are in
Jumeirah on Dubai's outskirts. Farther north, Sharjah has an
intriguing natural-history museum.
</P>
<P>
   Flights from the United States are not cheap; a typical
round-trip bargain fare to Dubai in the more-temperate months is
about $1,500, and there are no nonstops. But you may do better if
you shop around.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels like the Intercontinental, Novotel, Hyatt Regency and
Four Points Sheraton cost from $150 to $200 a night, but prices are
negotiable. Call up www.uae-pages.com or www.emirates.org. &QL;

   Q. This August we will be going to Bermuda with our daughters,
their husbands and four grandchildren. They want to swim with
dolphins while there, but I understand that reservations must be
made far in advance. Is this correct? _ Freda R. Eiberson, Long
Beach, N.Y. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Dolphin Quest, which opened in 1996 on the grounds of the
Southampton Princess Resort, is on a cove on the island's south
shore. Guests can interact with bottlenose dolphins in the
three-acre Dolphin Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Through October, a half-hour Kids Encounter (ages 5 to 12) costs
$85. Children can touch the dolphins while sitting on a submerged
dock.
</P>
<P>
   An Adult Encounter (ages 13 and older) is a half hour and costs
$95. Participants can touch and swim with dolphins. For each
program, swimsuits and towels are required.
</P>
<P>
   Space is limited in these programs, which are offered daily.
Guests at the Southampton or Hamilton Princess hotels can make
reservations at any time by calling (800) 441-1414. Otherwise, you
can reserve no more than four days in advance; contact Dolphin
Quest at the Southampton Princess, Post Office Box HM 1379,
Hamilton, HM FX, Bermuda; (441) 239-6957, fax (441) 238-4176.
</P>
<P>
   If you would like to reserve a private session with the
dolphins, however, you can make the reservation as far ahead as you
wish. It will cost $1,500, and you can have up to 10 persons in the
session, which is half an hour, like the the ones described above.

TWO GROUPS IN DNA RACE DIFFER ON FIXING PROJECT'S FINISH LINE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mo., British Columbia)  By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaders of the public consortium racing to decode the human
genome are expressing doubts that their rival, the Celera Corp.,
can produce a high quality version as soon as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining the human DNA sequence, or genome, is expected to be a
major landmark in scientific history and initiate a new,
genetically based era in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Celera's president, J. Craig Venter, said that he had
finished gathering raw sequence data on the human genome and
expected to piece together the millions of fragments into an
assembled sequence in three to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium expects to finish its version of the human genome
by 2003, but plans to have a ``rough draft'' by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health's
part of the consortium, attended a meeting in Vancouver, British
Columbia, over the weekend, and was quoted by The Associated Press
as saying, ``What we all need to recognize is that for the
sequencing for the human genome, there is not going to be a finish
line for any group, for at least the next couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   A consortium spokeswoman said Monday that Dr. Collins had not
criticized Celera but was referring to the definition of completing
the human genome. Nonetheless, Celera's stock dropped 20 percent,
to $103 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Completion is a matter on which the two sides differ, not least
because defining it is tantamount to deciding where the finish line
for the human genome race really lies. If some form of near
completeness passes muster, it now seems that Celera may win; if
the scientific community demands absolute completeness, then
probably only the consortium can afford to persevere to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Celera says that it can produce an essentially complete version
of the genome, and that it will fill in the inevitable gaps later.
Consortium biologists warn that Celera's version may be seriously
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Celera published its decoding of the Drosophila
fruit fly genome, a project undertaken to test its strategy for the
human genome. The fly genome had many small gaps, but was highly
praised by biologists who study the fly.
</P>
<P>
   The company said last week that its human genome would be of the
same quality as the fly's.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Waterston, director of the consortium's genome sequencing
center at Washington University in St. Louis, noted that Celera had
proportionately less raw data available for the human genome than
it had for the fly. ``I doubt that it will be as good as the fly
project,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the consortium's results, which are publicly
available, Celera seems to have comparatively little human data
available, especially in the 25 percent of the genome that the
consortium has not yet tackled.
</P>
<P>
   But Celera's scientists believe the human genome will be easier
to assemble than Drosophila's, even though it is 30 times as large,
because its regions of highly repetitive DNA _ the main obstacle to
assemblers _ are less problematic than the fly's. J. Paul Gilman,
Celera's director of policy planning, said the fly work had shown
that genomes could be successfully assembled by Celera's method
using less DNA data than first calculated.

Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036

 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The jokes about the government using the satellites
for ``Star Wars'' target practice don't seem so funny anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, Iridium LLC, the bankrupt global satellite
telephone company, will begin sending 88 giant satellites spiraling
toward Earth, where they will burn up in a fitting and fiery end to
one of the colossal corporate failures in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   After spending more than $5 billion on a system that promised to
communicate ``with anyone, anytime, virtually anywhere in the
world,'' Iridium could muster only about 55,000 subscribers, not
enough even to pay interest on its start-up costs.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares plummeted months ago, and banks,
bondholders and investors are left to wince at their staggering
losses. Motorola, which started it all, has written off more than
$2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company finds itself fumbling through a messy and
sometimes comic liquidation. Customers are angry, half the system
is shut down, the other half is apparently still operating, and
Iridium is still holding out the hope that someone will buy the
satellite network before it goes up in flames.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear, though: rarely has a company so ambitious,
and so heavily financed, fallen so hard and so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a technology that didn't live up to its hype or its
billing,'' said James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate
Observer, who has chronicled Iridium's problems, noting that the
telephones could not even be used indoors. ``People chose to
overlook the risks because they were bedazzled by the technology
and the promoters or sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   Two satellite networks are trying to keep the idea alive: ICO
Global Telecommunications, which is trying to climb out of
bankruptcy under its new owner, Craig O. McCaw, the cellular phone
pioneer; and Globalstar LLC, the venture backed by Loral Space and
Communications and led by Bernard Schwartz, who once called Iridium
a ``three-legged horse.''
</P>
<P>
   But as they do, here is what it looks like to shut down a global
satellite service that officially lasted 474 days.
</P>
<P>
   According to Motorola, whose engineers conceived the idea in the
Arizona desert in 1987, time and marketing failures hurt the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a technology that worked,'' said Scott Wyman, a
spokesman for Motorola, at headquarters in Schaumburg, Ill., near
Chicago. ``But Iridium management pursued a marketing plan that in
retrospect may not have been targeted at the most attractive
available market.''
</P>
<P>
   Iridium itself has little to say, with all calls referred to the
deputy general counsel. The chief executive resigned quietly on
March 17 _ the day Iridium, in a letter to subscribers, declared
itself dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under the scrutiny of a bankruptcy judge, a few remaining
executives, lawyers and accountants are trying to safely dismantle
a service that took 12 years to create, and less than two to
destroy.
</P>
<P>
   The company has vacated its Washington headquarters, tried to
sell its building in Landsdowne, Va., held a job fair for
employees, and talked to the U.S. Space Command Center in Colorado
Springs, Colo., about the proper time to dispose of a constellation
of low-earth-orbit satellites traveling at 17,000 miles an hour.
While a few executives hold out hope that someone might buy the
satellites, this seems increasingly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   A few loyal subscribers still get free service in North America.
Motorola sent out notices saying that service would end at 11:59
p.m. on March 17. But the company continues to offer limited
service, largely because the federal government, an early investor,
is still trying to wean itself away from the global network.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who lost service are not happy. For Jack Conroy,
who flies an ambulance helicopter in Anchorage, Alaska, Iridium
phones were a lifeline. ``Communications up here is real
difficult,'' he said. ``If I'm in a canyon, it's hard to get
service. With Iridium, you could.''
</P>
<P>
   The death knell was actually sounded more than a month ago, when
McCaw decided against bailing out the company and creating a larger
satellite network with ICO Global.
</P>
<P>
   On March 2, Ronald Brouckman, Iridium's chief operating officer,
briefed the staff on what life would be like once McCaw took over.
But later that night, an employee said, ``McCaw called our COO and
said, `I've changed my mind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many employees were already demoralized. In the final months,
they say, John Richardson, the chief executive, rarely showed up at
headquarters. Richardson, a former executive at Barclays Bank, was
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Many who held on were dubbed ``Iridiots,'' and they felt that
way. Employees say they often sat in quiet offices playing computer
solitaire or perfecting their Microsoft PowerPoint presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing was surreal,'' a former employee said. ``We
were just waiting for the clock to run out.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola has stopped making Iridium phones at its Libertyville,
Ill., plant and has closed its satellite communications division in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven independent gateway companies that sold service around
the world are being dismantled. Iridium North America, whose
investors besides Motorola include Sprint and BCE of Canada, had
30,000 subscribers at its peak. The company, based in Chandler,
Ariz., is offering free service until Motorola pulls the plug, but
has trimmed its staff to 30 from 175.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department, which had a $200 million contract to
participate in the project, also continues to use the service. It
says it spent $140 million building its own gateway in Hawaii and
paying Motorola to run it, and buying 3,000 satellite handsets. Now
the Pentagon is looking for alternatives. ``We're going to have to
evaluate our next step,'' a Defense Department spokeswoman, Susan
Hanson, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Iridium network is controlled by the Satellite Network
Operations Center, in Landsdowne, which is operated by Motorola.
About 100 staff members are still on hand, monitoring the
satellites, taking calls and coordinating with the Space Command
Center to bring the satellites down.
</P>
<P>
   The command center, a sort of traffic cop that tracks objects in
space, including tiny debris, will essentially offer guidance to
Motorola about where and when to deorbit the satellites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actively tracking 8,200 objects _ 8,120 to be exact,''
said Capt. Steven Ramsay. ``We even track an astronaut's glove from
a Gemini mission in the 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Space Command Center, Iridium will probably
deorbit the satellites four at a time, firing their thrusters to
drop them into the atmosphere, where they will most likely burn up.
But ``they expect to have some parts survive because these are
pretty big satellites,'' a spokesman, Maj. Perry Nouis, said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   It took 12 years and more than 20 million lines of computer code
to build the system, but less than two years to realize that not
enough people wanted to use it. It will take two years more to pull
the satellites out of orbit.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Iridium has few other assets, with a skeleton staff of about 60
employees _ mostly accountants, lawyers and other administrative
people. After McCaw pulled out, Iridium told the bankruptcy court
that no one had put up the $10 million necessary to qualify as a
serious bidder, and he laid off 175 people.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of inquiries, but some seemed almost comical.
Some did not have the money, Iridium officials say, others did not
have even a proper telephone number. They keep coming. ``I still
get 50 calls a day,'' said Robert N. Beury, Iridium's deputy
general counsel. ``Some people want to go up with space tugs, and
move the things somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, no one can make sense of it. Wall Street loved
Iridium; there were supposed to be 1.6 million subscribers this
year, and 27 million by 2007. Sure, there were bulky handsets,
technical glitches and a poor marketing effort, analysts say, but
how could they have been this wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Easy, others say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the industry has looked at Iridium as the pioneers
of satellite phone service,'' said Rikki Lee, editor of Wireless
Week. ``And when they couldn't find anyone to pay $3,000 for a
phone and $7 a minute for service, it was like _ duh! There aren't
all that many people who track up to the North Pole.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ We start with the Atlanta Thrashers' 14-61-7 record.
It is what people will remember the most until training camp starts
in September.
</P>
<P>
   The record that was the fourth-worst among 13 expansion teams
since 1970. The record with the fourth-highest loss total in NHL
history. The record that featured 29 home defeats, second all-time.
The record that included losing streaks of 12, 10 and seven.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran center Ray Ferraro, looking at that dismal record, said:
``I know we made a lot of changes this year. But, let's face it, we
only won 14 games, so we'll probably make a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers' inaugural season has been put to bed. Or laid to
rest. Only those counting turnstile rotations can claim success.
But, standings aside, general manager Don Waddell saw progress from
the season-opening 4-1 loss to New Jersey to the season-ending 2-1
loss to Carolina _ and not because of the goal differential in
those two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we approached the season was we wanted to be better in
game 20 than at the start, better in game 40, game 60 and game
80,'' Waddell said. ``But you can't always measure things in wins
or losses. Right now, there's no question our lineup is better than
before. Would we like to have had more wins? Of course? Have we
made strides? Yes. Are we going to stand pat? No.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers won only half as many games as Nashville did in
its first season, although it is worth noting that the Predators
finished with an identical 28-47-7 record this season. Nashville
might think now that its first-year mark skewed reality; the
Thrashers hope the same for their own record.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey teams are built from the back out, and goaltending was a
problem most of the season for the Thrashers. Starter Damian Rhodes
started slowly, missed four months with an ankle sprain, played
well for a stretch after his return, then appeared fatigued from a
string of 11 starts in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse was what happened during his absence. Norm Maracle,
though strong in his last few appearances, was inconsistent and
lost the confidence of the coaching staff. Maracle, Scott
Fankhouser and Scott Langkow, all rookies, rotated during Rhodes'
absence. The defense included two busts from the expansion draft,
Darryl Shannon and Kevin Dean, so it's no wonder the Thrashers had
the league's worst team goals-against average of 3.78 and allowed
313 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell made several moves to improve the team's skill level.
The best sent Kelly Buchberger and Nelson Emerson to Los Angeles
for Donald Audette and defenseman Frantisek Kaberle. In 14 games,
Audette had seven goals, 11 points and 50 shots on goal. The team's
average shot total improved after the trade to 28.6 from 25.2.
Goaltending and defense now are the priority.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of this summer:
</P>
<P>
   _ In goal: The Thrashers will not pick up the $1 million option
on Maracle's contract, although he might be back at a lower figure.
Regardless, Waddell will pursue a veteran goalie in a trade,
probably before the June 23 expansion draft. Several teams that
have two strong goalies plan to protect only one from Minnesota and
Columbus, and they might choose to get something in return for the
other. Maracle has been criticized for his poor conditioning and
work habits. Waddell said he still believes in the goalie, but he
also said, ``This is the most important summer he's going to have
as a professional. He can't spend three months on his boat.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The draft: The Thrashers will be weighted first in a lottery
for the No. 1 pick in the June 24-25 entry draft. But whether they
have the first or second pick, Waddell might trade down or even out
of the first round, because it has no clear-cut top choice. ``Last
year, I said I won't trade the first pick,'' he said. ``I'm not
saying that this year.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Signings: The free-agent market is thin, but Waddell will be
busy with his own team. At the NHL and minor-league level, 19
players, not including Maracle, do not have a contract for next
season. Johan Garpenlov, who is not expected back, and Mike
Stapleton, who might be, are the only unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers went through 43 players this season, and Waddell
conceded that there had been mistakes: Shannon and Dean on defense,
Maracle to date, the decision not to pick up Steve Sullivan off
waivers from Toronto. Chicago did, and Sullivan scored 22 goals for
the Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell worried more about tomorrow than today, which led to the
departures of veterans like Terry Yake and Jody Hull in the
pre-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would've been a better team this year if we kept those
guys,'' Waddell said. ``But where would we be at the start of next
year? What if guys like (Andreas) Karlsson never got a chance to
play? Would they be as good next year?''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, the expectations go up. Waddell said he would be
disappointed ``if we didn't win at least 10 more games.'' That
total, 24, might be more reachable than originally thought.

SURFING FOR BARGAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., April 16) 
 By L.R. SHANNON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is common enough, and easy enough, to reserve a seat on an
airliner from your computer's keyboard, but we don't always want to
travel by air. At times we want to get from here to there by rental
car, or to have one waiting for us at the airport; there are even
souls who prefer to or must travel by train or bus. How easy is
that to arrange from the screen? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has its ups and downs, no pun intended. I tried to rent cars
from five well-known companies _ Hertz, Avis, Budget, Enterprise,
and National _ with mixed results, and also dipped into Amtrak and
Greyhound, which were solid if uninspired. All of them require a
lot of information, such as where you are leaving from and when,
what class of car you want to drive or _ in Amtrak's case _ what
class of seat you want. The selections are mostly made from menus,
so there is little typing to do, and the menus are similar enough
from one site to another that when you've learned to use one you
have largely learned to use them all _ and dissimilar enough that
you must not leap to conclusions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Renting cars on line is a growing business. Frank Camacho, staff
vice president for marketing at Hertz, said that 3 percent of the
company's rentals were booked online last year, and that the rate
has been increasing by 100 percent a year for three years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the rental cars, I decided to get a compact car seating four
from a station near my house in northern New Jersey, picking it up
at 9 a.m. on April 22, and returning it on April 29. I breezed
through both Hertz, at www.hertz.com, and Avis, at www.avis.com,
and found similar cars at each for the same price, $387.95 with
unlimited mileage. But at Enterprise's site, www.enterprise.com, I
had to change both pickup and return times to match the hours when
the office was open. The price: $218.99 for 750 miles, 20 cents a
mile thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   I went through the process at Budget, www.drivebudget.com, and
was finally told: ``We are unable to confirm your request for one
of the following reasons: There are no cars available. The car/rate
you requested is not available for one-way rental.'' I could have
selected a new day, time or location, but chose not to. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National Car Rental, www.nationalcar.com, was more of a problem.
There was no office in my neighborhood, so I selected one from a
list of offices in New Jersey, and finished the rental process. An
arcane error message appeared. I tried a second and third time, to
make sure I hadn't done something wrong or omitted a step, and got
the same message both times. Finally, a call to the toll-free
telephone number given on the Web page brought the disconcerting
information that National had no office at the location I had
picked from National's own screen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The prices do not include insurance, or reflect discounts or
incentives that vary from site to site. When you wrap up the rental
by providing credit-card information, you are given a confirmation
number, just as if you had made arrangements by telephone, to take
to the company's office.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are other rental-car agencies besides the big names, of
course. Among those I peeked at were www.americar.com, with offices
in Orlando, Fla.; Syracuse; Huntsville, Ala.; Minneapolis and
Albany, and www.autorentnet.com, which rents cars in both the
United States and Europe. The second has a section where you can
rent luxury cars _ Jaguars, BMW's, Mercedes-Benzes and others _ for
about $570 to $2,900 a week. The section for more reasonably priced
cars, however, is restricted to Europeans visiting the United
States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At www.amtrak.com, you can browse among the schedules and fares
and buy tickets. I checked out one-way fares from Newark to
Washington; an irritation is that you must use Amtrak's
three-letter abbreviations, so the fares I checked out were from
NWK to WAS. An unreserved coach seat on the morning of April 22, a
Saturday, was $67. If you reserve a seat online, you must print out
a copy of the screen with the confirmation number and exchange it
for a ticket at the train station. According to Steven Taubenkibel,
an Amtrak spokesman, 5 percent of all tickets are now sold online.

LABOR DEPT. FAULTS UTILITY'S PSYCHIATRIC EXAM OF NUCLEAR WORKER 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Department of Labor has concluded that the
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. maneuvered to have psychiatrists find
``paranoid delusions'' in a veteran manager because he complained
publicly about safety problems and management inaction at the
Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission says there is no evidence
of any retaliation against the manager, Neil J. Aiken, who was a
shift foreman from 1983 until he received the diagnosis in 1998,
and the commission does not believe that the incident or the
Department of Labor report will make others reluctant to come
forward with safety problems they observe on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The utility company says it had only public safety in mind when
it sent Aiken, now 54, to psychiatrists for an evaluation. It later
fired him, although his lawyer and company officials differ on the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Four operators and managers at the plant said in separate
interviews that they believed that Aiken was mentally sound and was
fired because he embarrassed top executives. Two said they had been
trained by the utility to spot mental instability.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Aiken complained about problems at Diablo, near San
Luis Obispo, Calif., where he had worked since before the plant was
completed. In April 1998, he went to a shareholders meeting and
distributed a paper detailing his criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the utility sent him to two psychiatrists, under a
program that the NRC requires it to maintain. One described Aiken,
who went into the nuclear industry after learning electronics in
the Marine Corps, as suffering from a ``delusional disorder,
persecutory type.'' The psychiatrists declared Aiken a threat to
security, and the company revoked his security clearance. Late last
year, it fired him.
</P>
<P>
   But a report issued in November by the Labor Department, which
enforces laws against harassmen of whistle-blowers, suggested that
the real problem was that Aiken had publicly embarrassed his
superiors. Notes by one psychiatrist, the Labor Department report
said, show that the doctor's conversations with utility executives
before he did his work were ``more about how to remove Mr. Aiken
from his position than to make a fair, unbiased evaluation of Mr.
Aiken's mental state.''
</P>
<P>
   A Labor Department investigator, acknowledging his own lack of
training in psychology, said in the report that the diagnosis of a
delusional disorder ``appears unreasoned considering the fact that
the evaluators never considered that other employees had complained
about the same problem, there existed a culture where employees
were reluctant to voice safety complaints, and the evaluators never
checked to see if his thoughts were delusional.''
</P>
<P>
   A critical point of contention was the safety of the new circuit
breakers the company installed because the old ones allowed
electrical arcs. The new ones did not, but several operators said
they created other problems because they did not fit in easily with
the old equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that company managers told the psychiatrists
that Aiken was unable to accept that ``numerous investigations''
had rejected his position on circuit breakers, but that when the
company gave this information to its psychiatrists, the NRC was
still investigating the circuit breakers.
</P>
<P>
   The commission disputed this but said its report was secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRC advertises that you don't have to be afraid of
retaliation,'' Aiken said in a telephone interview. ``But the fact
is that no one can stop the corporation from doing what they want
to do to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief nuclear officer of Pacific Gas and Electric, Gregory
Rueger, said that the company's need to protect public safety
conflicted with its need to avoid the appearance of retaliation,
but that the former was more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times you deal with Neil that he's a very reasonable
individual,'' Rueger said in a telephone interview. But at other
times, Rueger claimed, Aiken would change the details of his
complaint. He said that employees still filed safety complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Aiken, unemployed, recently reached a settlement with the
company that included early retirement. As a result, the utility's
appeal of the Labor Department report will not be heard, leaving
the differences between the two agencies unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not be properly husbanding the taxpayers' money if we
spent additional resources investigating,'' said Gary F. Sanborn,
an enforcement officer for the NRC.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said that Aiken had made 50 complaints to the
agency, of which about 18 were well founded _ a higher percentage,
officials said, than that of most complainants. The agency cited
Pacific Gas and Electric for two low-level violations and told the
company to fix 16 other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Forty of Aiken's co-workers took the unusual step of petitioning
the NRC for his reinstatement.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The United States is largely to blame for the
suffering of Afghan women under the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
   It was U.S. action that brought the Taliban to power, and the
Taliban could be removed if the United States and the United
Nations had the will to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the opinions of activists working to help the women.
Since the Taliban militia captured Kabul in 1996, girls have been
prevented from attending school. Women lost their jobs as doctors,
lawyers, teachers and government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Women are under virtual house arrest, prohibited from leaving
their homes unless they're accompanied by a male relative. This
rule is especially hard on the 300,000 wid ows in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When women do go outside, they must be covered from head to toe
with a shroud with only a small piece of mesh over the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They can be beaten for showing an ankle. They lack health care
because male doctors are forbidden from treating women patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, activists lobbied for sup port of Afghan women at
Feminist Expo 2000, an international gather ing of women's rights
advocates in Baltimore that drew about 6,000 women and men from
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the convention was Zieba Shorish-Shamley,
director of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in
Afghanistan. She criticizes the United States for aban doning
Afghanistan after the Soviets ended their occupation in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Russia withdrew, the U.S. lost interest, and that's the
time we needed the U.S. the most,'' Shorish-Shamley said ``That's
when foreign, neighboring countries (such as Paki stan), each with
their own interest, moved in and started supporting different
factions.''
</P>
<P>
   She's angry that the CIA supported the rebels during Soviet
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban _ Pakistan trained it; Saudi Arabia financed it;
and the U.S. blessed it,''Shorish-Stamley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cash, arms, food and medicine for the rebels were channeled from
the United States through the Pakistani intelligence service, said
Philip Smith, director of research and analysis for a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank, the Center for Public Policy Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was staff director for the Congressional Task Force on Af
ghanist an from 1988 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We more or less deferred to them (Pakistani intelligence), and
that was a big mistake,'' Smith said. ``U.S. policy changed
dramatically when bombs went off (at U.S. embassies in 1998) in Dar
es Salaam as well as Nairobi. At that point, I think policymakers
smelled the coffee. Prior to that, they often looked the other way
when fundamentalists were seizing control of Afghani stan.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States blamed Osama Bin Laden for the embassy
bombings and retaliated by bombing what it said was a chemical
factory in the Sudan and three training camps of Bin Laden's in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Clinton administration is prepared to bomb Afghanistan
over Bin Laden, why don't we start pushing the international
community (on behalf of Afghan women)?? asked T. Kuman, an
executive with Amnesty international.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't the U.S. and other countries put pressure on the
three countries that recognize the Taliban _ Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates?''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has become more interested in Afghanistan
because of the oil and gas in former Soviet republics,
Shorish-Shamley said.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Unocal joined a consortium with oil companies
from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia with the idea of building a pipeline
from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan to Pakistan. Unocal dropped
out in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Leno, activist and wife of comedian Jay Leno, wants the
United States to pressure Pakistan to stop supporting the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it clear to our governments that for the rest of their
lives, every time they look in the rear-view mirror, they'll see
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>

FUJIMORI APPEARS CLOSE TO WINNING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN FIRST
ROUND
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Official returns on Monday showed President Alberto
Fujimori approaching a first-round victory in Peru's presidential
election, prompting cries of fraud and fears of mass disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Sunday's voting, polls of voters and independent
vote counts had suggested that neither Fujimori nor his challenger,
Alejandro Toledo, would garner a majority, raising hopes among
foreign diplomats and election monitors of a second-round ballot
that might avoid the irregularities and dirty tricks that have
accompanied the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But with 39 percent of the vote counted, the National Election
Office said Fujimori had received 49.88 percent to Toledo's 39.98.
That, coupled with unexplained delays of up to several hours in
getting ballot boxes and tally sheets to computer centers, led to
suspicions of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The ballots have already been destroyed, as allowed by Peruvian
law.
</P>
<P>
   When the first allegations of counting irregularities surfaced
just before midnight, Toledo led tens of thousands of protesters on
a march to the presidential palace, where they were driven back by
police using tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters carried Toledo on their shoulders, then threw tear
gas canisters back at the police and at the palace itself, chanting
``The fear is gone!''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said on Monday that the election results should be
annulled. ``The quantity and seriousness of the irregularities _
from the ballots to the counting centers _ has led us to the
conclusion not to recognize the results,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a business-school professor trained in the United
States, has never held high public office. But during his long-shot
campaign he demonstrated a knack for timing and an ability to
motivate energetic support, especially from working-class people.
</P>
<P>
   He and his supporters threatened a prolonged civil disobedience
campaign, one which could make a third five-year term untenable for
Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign election monitors expressed particular concern over the
widespread delays in getting tally sheets and ballots to counting
centers. Some arrived as many as seven hours after polls were
closed, even in cities like Lima and Arequipa, where there was no
reason for such delays.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Organization of American States observer team,
Eduardo Stein, also said he could not understand why dozens of
government computer centers were shut down through Sunday night and
most of Monday, when they were supposed to be open and tallying
ballots. He said he could not ascertain how the government was
coming to its official count, or where the count was taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried,'' said Stein, a former foreign minister of
Guatemala. ``All the signals we got yesterday evening were
disquieting because there was a big and inexplicable delay in the
transportation of the vote tabulation sheets and the ballot boxes
to the computer counting centers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something sinister is happening here,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If everything that caused those delays has a
reasonable explanation, why don't they offer a reasonable
explanation to the public?''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has remained silent since the vote, but top government
officials have publicly rejected charges of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A questionable Fujimori victory would put the United States and
the Organization of American States in the difficult position of
deciding whether to accept the results or retract their recognition
of the Fujimori government and levy sanctions until new elections
are called.
</P>
<P>
   When the election had appeared headed for a run-off, the State
Department had urged the Peruvian government ``to take every
possible measure to ensure that the next round of voting fully
meets democratic standards of openness, transparency and
fairness.'' There was no subsequent statement.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has long been a key U.S. ally in fighting international
narcotics trafficking, and is seen as a strong leader who can
prevent the kind of guerrilla turbulence wracking neighboring
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   But since election day there have been reports that convicts
voted, that ballots were tampered with to remove Toledo's name,
that people were paid to vote for Fujimori and that police and army
officials harassed election monitors of opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   According to election observers, the vote tally sheets, which
were scheduled to be delivered by 9 p.m. on Sunday night to the
computer centers, did not reach the centers until between 4 a.m.
and 5 a.m. Monday morning, and the delays were nationwide and
appeared to be systematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This process has been contaminated,'' said Rafael Roncagliolo,
a director of Transparencia, a private Peruvian election monitoring
group that is largely funded by the U.S. government. ``If they
avert a second round, we can only conclude that they have had a
long-term plan for fraud all along.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick count of vote tally sheets by Transparencia on Sunday
night found that Fujimori had won 48.7 percent of the vote. On
Monday, Transparencia officials said that if anything, its tally
overestimated the Fujimori vote. An Organization of American States
quick count of separate vote tally sheets came to a similar
conclusion that a second round would be held.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, with 39.15 percent of the official vote count
complete, the government election authority reported that Fujimori
had won 49.88 percent of the ballots, just short of the majority
needed to avert a runoff vote with Toledo. Election officials noted
that their tallies did not include votes from the most remote
jungle and Andean Indian villages, where Fujimori has been
traditionally strongest and where election monitors say the chances
for fraud are greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Portillo, the top Peruvian election authority, told
reporters on Monday that there were no computing problems and that
``a very rigorous effort'' was being made to assure an accurate
vote count. ``A Dutch observer asked me why there were so many
safeguards,'' he added, ``and I responded that we are very careful
people.''

AFGHAN WOMEN SUFFERING: U.S., U.N. BLAMED BY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The United States is largely to blame for the
suffering of Afghan women under the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
   It was U.S. action that brought the Taliban to power, and the
Taliban could be removed if the United States and the United
Nations had the will to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the opinions of activists working to help the women.
Since the Taliban militia captured Kabul in 1996, girls have been
prevented from attending school. Women lost their jobs as doctors,
lawyers, teachers and government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Women are under virtual house arrest, prohibited from leaving
their homes unless they're accompanied by a male relative. This
rule is especially hard on the 300,000 wid ows in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When women do go outside, they must be covered from head to toe
with a shroud with only a small piece of mesh over the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They can be beaten for showing an ankle. They lack health care
because male doctors are forbidden from treating women patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, activists lobbied for sup port of Afghan women at
Feminist Expo 2000, an international gather ing of women's rights
advocates in Baltimore that drew about 6,000 women and men from
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the convention was Zieba Shorish-Shamley,
director of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in
Afghanistan. She criticizes the United States for aban doning
Afghanistan after the Soviets ended their occupation in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Russia withdrew, the U.S. lost interest, and that's the
time we needed the U.S. the most,'' Shorish-Shamley said ``That's
when foreign, neighboring countries (such as Paki stan), each with
their own interest, moved in and started supporting different
factions.''
</P>
<P>
   She's angry that the CIA supported the rebels during Soviet
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban _ Pakistan trained it; Saudi Arabia financed it;
and the U.S. blessed it,''Shorish-Stamley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cash, arms, food and medicine for the rebels were channeled from
the United States through the Pakistani intelligence service, said
Philip Smith, director of research and analysis for a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank, the Center for Public Policy Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was staff director for the Congressional Task Force on Af
ghanist an from 1988 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We more or less deferred to them (Pakistani intelligence), and
that was a big mistake,'' Smith said. ``U.S. policy changed
dramatically when bombs went off (at U.S. embassies in 1998) in Dar
es Salaam as well as Nairobi. At that point, I think policymakers
smelled the coffee. Prior to that, they often looked the other way
when fundamentalists were seizing control of Afghani stan.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States blamed Osama Bin Laden for the embassy
bombings and retaliated by bombing what it said was a chemical
factory in the Sudan and three training camps of Bin Laden's in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Clinton administration is prepared to bomb Afghanistan
over Bin Laden, why don't we start pushing the international
community (on behalf of Afghan women)?? asked T. Kuman, an
executive with Amnesty international.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't the U.S. and other countries put pressure on the
three countries that recognize the Taliban _ Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates?''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has become more interested in Afghanistan
because of the oil and gas in former Soviet republics,
Shorish-Shamley said.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Unocal joined a consortium with oil companies
from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia with the idea of building a pipeline
from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan to Pakistan. Unocal dropped
out in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Leno, activist and wife of comedian Jay Leno, wants the
United States to pressure Pakistan to stop supporting the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it clear to our governments that for the rest of their
lives, every time they look in the rear-view mirror, they'll see
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, governments and busi nesses should pressure the
Taliban the way they pressured South Africa to end racial
apartheid, said Deb Ellis, author of the soon-to-be-pub lished book
``Women of the Afghan War.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advocate, who asks to be identified only as Sajeda, is
angry at the U.S. government for getting involved during the Soviet
invasion.

 &HT;    Braves turn cold in loss against Cubs
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Newly falling snow provided a fitting backdrop to what
the Cubs did to the Braves in the ninth inning Monday afternoon,
turning back-to-back walks into a four-run rally to stun the Braves
4-3 and warm the 38,655 fans who showed up for the opener of the
85th season at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Down 3-0 with three outs left, the Cubs mustered their first
miracle of the 2000 season after losing three extra-inning games.
They rode Shane Andrews' three-run homer off Kerry Ligtenberg for
their third win of the season, handing the Braves their third loss.
</P>
<P>
   It spoiled a dominating start from Kevin Millwood, wasted
another home run from Andres Galarraga, and exposed Ligtenberg's
decision to pick the frigid confines of Wrigley Field to start
throwing his slider.
</P>
<P>
   After using exclusively fastballs to collect two saves in his
first two opportunities, Ligtenberg threw a slider to Andrews 1-2,
which he fouled off. Ligtenberg came right back with another
slider, this one worse, and Andrews turned on it for a homer to
left field that tied the game 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Another single to Damon Buford, and Ligtenberg had to put the
game in the hands of 21-year-old Luis Rivera, who gave up the
winning single to Jeff Reed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem was walking the leadoff batter,'' said
Ligtenberg, who walked Glenallen Hill after Mike Remlinger had
walked Mark Grace to start the ninth. ``That started the whole
thing. ... I didn't make the pitches I needed to make. I wanted
(the slider) to be out more.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rivera, the trip to the mound was his first with a game in
the balance. Joe Girardi sacrificed the winning run into scoring
position for Reed, who timed Rivera's fastball for a single down
the left field line, this after missing it badly twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to stick with my best pitch,'' Rivera said. ``He beat
me, so that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga's road back from cancer took a turn on Waveland
Avenue, where he deposited a Jon Lieber fastball for his fourth
home run of the season and a 3-0 lead for Kevin Millwood.
</P>
<P>
   But by the ninth, it was all for naught.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who won each of their first two series against the
Rockies and Giants, will have to take two in a row from the Cubs on
Wednesday and Thursday to see that streak continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry hung a slider and boom, out,'' said Bobby Cox, summing
up the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones blamed it on a shrinking strike zone from home
plate umpire Larry Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was you had a tea cup-sized strike zone,'' Jones
said. ``There weren't any walks all game and all of a sudden it's a
different game. It's a fluke. It's a shame because we played hard
and Millwood pitched his butt off.''

Hits section includes a number of notable Daily News photos,
including the well-known Charles Hoff picture of the Hindenburg
zeppelin ablaze after exploding at Lakehurst, N.J., i 1937, plus
the obligatory duck-and-cover photo from a 1960s atomic bomb drill
and a portrait of John Lennon and Yoko Ono. There is also a Rosie

entered factories to replace men who were fighting overseas; a
photo of David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam killer, being led into
police headquarters; and poet Allen Ginsberg reading his work in
Washington Square Park.

   The New York Noir section is devoted to crime photos, including
the picture of Ruth Snyder being executed in the electric chair at
Sing Sing prison, the aftermath of the assassination of mobster

   Trying to drag your kids away from those dreaded Pok mon cards?
Want to trick them into learning something? Then Dig, a bi-monthly
published by the Archaeological Institute of America, is for you.
It's archaeology for kids, chock full of interesting articles,
games, puzzles and cartoons, all based on ancient cultures and
discovery. Written in a straightforward, accessible style, the
magazine actually tries to make learning fun. Don't let the board
of education hear about this. Lead story, about the great pyramids
of Egypt, does a fine job explaining why the pyramids are such an
amazing feat of engineering (no slide rules, pocket protectors or
the Internet back in those days). Of course, it goes a little over
the top in quoting Napoleon, in the original French, remarking on
the pyramids. There is another good piece on how archaeologists
date artifacts, explaining how different items are found on
different levels of a dig, and how carbon-14 dating is used.
Another interesting piece trie s to determine whether Hercules
really lived, or is just a creation of Greek mythology and Michael
Eisner. Can you dig it?  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   This week's cover story profiles Paul Newman, salad dressing
entrepreneur and part-time actor. Naturally, the story is a fawning
piece of fluff, but the pictures are cool, stretching from Newman's
high school yearbook photo to studio shots of him in Cool Hand
Luke, The Sting, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Color
of Money, for which he won an Oscar. The story starts out talking
about how amusing Newman is, but none of the jokes he tells are
very funny. But he does, the author slyly notes, still have those
same blue eyes. Let's hope so. In the way of actual history, there
is a decent piece on John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil,
the mammoth monopoly that was broken up by a trust-busting Teddy
Roosevelt and turned into most of the gas stations you see on
corners today. The story also notes that Rockefeller turned
philanthropist in his later years, giving millions to education,
health care, churches and orphanages. Bully. In the Masters of the
Stunningly Obvious section, there's a story noting that movie star
Cameron Diaz is quite fetching. Bully, bully. &QL;

   Lead story examines the hullabaloo around the Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (MAP for short), a NASA project that will catalog
microwave photons to answer the largest questions of the universe:
how old it is, how it will end, whether space is really infinite
and where exactly did I leave my car keys? The mission is a
follow-up to the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) that found the
faint afterglow of the Big Bang. If it survives its testing, and
launch, MAP will use its sophisticated equipment to recreate ``the
universe's baby picture.'' Another article notes that chimpanzees
speak in dialects, invent odd grooming styles and drum better than
most kids in marching bands, meaning they are closer to humans than
previously thought. And their TV shows are better than prime time,
too. In the category of Tediously Pointless Pursuits, a group of
climbers clambered up Mount Everest to stick a global positioning
device on top, to finally, once and for all, get its exact
elevation. And they got it. Plus or minus 7 feet. Doh!  &QL;

taken over the years, many wit strong historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   From the main site, click on Photo Gallery, and you'll reach a
screen with `Greatest Hits'' and `New York Noir.'' The Greatest
Hits section includes a number of notable Daily News photos,
including the well-known Charles Hoff picture of the Hindenburg
zeppelin ablaze after exploding at Lakehurst, N.J., i 1937, plus
the obligatory duck-and-cover photo from a 1960s atomic bomb drill
and a portrait of John Lennon and Yoko Ono. There is also a Rosie
the Riveter photo from the World War II era, during which women
entered factories to replace men who were fighting overseas; a
photo of David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam killer, being led into
police headquarters; and poet Allen Ginsberg reading his work in
Washington Square Park.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Noir section is devoted to crime photos, including
the picture of Ruth Snyder being executed in the electric chair at
Sing Sing prison, the aftermath of the assassination of mobster
Albert Anastasia and several other graphic street crime photos.

</P>
<P>
   Trying to drag your kids away from those dreaded Pok mon cards?
Want to trick them into learning something? Then Dig, a bi-monthly
published by the Archaeological Institute of America, is for you.
It's archaeology for kids, chock full of interesting articles,
games, puzzles and cartoons, all based on ancient cultures and
discovery. Written in a straightforward, accessible style, the
magazine actually tries to make learning fun. Don't let the board
of education hear about this. Lead story, about the great pyramids
of Egypt, does a fine job explaining why the pyramids are such an
amazing feat of engineering (no slide rules, pocket protectors or
the Internet back in those days). Of course, it goes a little over
the top in quoting Napoleon, in the original French, remarking on
the pyramids. There is another good piece on how archaeologists
date artifacts, explaining how different items are found on
different levels of a dig, and how carbon-14 dating is used.
Another interesting piece trie s to determine whether Hercules
really lived, or is just a creation of Greek mythology and Michael
Eisner. Can you dig it?  &QL;

 &UR; ``BIOGRAPHY'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week's cover story profiles Paul Newman, salad dressing
entrepreneur and part-time actor. Naturally, the story is a fawning
piece of fluff, but the pictures are cool, stretching from Newman's
high school yearbook photo to studio shots of him in Cool Hand
Luke, The Sting, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Color
of Money, for which he won an Oscar. The story starts out talking
about how amusing Newman is, but none of the jokes he tells are
very funny. But he does, the author slyly notes, still have those
same blue eyes. Let's hope so. In the way of actual history, there
is a decent piece on John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil,
the mammoth monopoly that was broken up by a trust-busting Teddy
Roosevelt and turned into most of the gas stations you see on
corners today. The story also notes that Rockefeller turned
philanthropist in his later years, giving millions to education,
health care, churches and orphanages. Bully. In the Masters of the
Stunningly Obvious section, there's a story noting that movie star
Cameron Diaz is quite fetching. Bully, bully. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``DISCOVER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lead story examines the hullabaloo around the Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (MAP for short), a NASA project that will catalog
microwave photons to answer the largest questions of the universe:
how old it is, how it will end, whether space is really infinite
and where exactly did I leave my car keys? The mission is a
follow-up to the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) that found the
faint afterglow of the Big Bang. If it survives its testing, and
launch, MAP will use its sophisticated equipment to recreate ``the
universe's baby picture.'' Another article notes that chimpanzees
speak in dialects, invent odd grooming styles and drum better than
most kids in marching bands, meaning they are closer to humans than
previously thought. And their TV shows are better than prime time,
too. In the category of Tediously Pointless Pursuits, a group of
climbers clambered up Mount Everest to stick a global positioning
device on top, to finally, once and for all, get its exact
elevation. And they got it. Plus or minus 7 feet. Doh!  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ``A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Susan Merrell (HarperCollins, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This novel is built on a provocative idea but suffers in the
execution. Chris and Deborah Latham and their 3-year-old daughter
are the perfect family when they adopt an orphaned toddler from
Romania, but their dreams of a happy foursome are destroyed by
troubles from their new son's past. Because he was neglected as a
baby, Michael grows into a brutal boy _ his adoptive father calls
him ``amoral,'' incapable of love or socialization. By the time he
starts kindergarten, he is a danger to his classmates. Deborah's
efforts to help him and her determination to keep him in the family
even as he chips away a t her marriage are heart-rending.
Unfortunately, our sympathy for Michael is strained _ at times, he
is nothing less than demonic. Merrell also adds a distra cting
subplot about Chris Latham's past that culminates in a long scene
during which he and Deborah seem to forget that they've left
Michael at home, attacking his tutor. The book could do with less
plot and a defter touch with the lit tle boy at its heart.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``BEREFT'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Jane Bernstein (North Point, $24) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One evening in 1966, an Arizona State University student named
Laura Bernstein was stabbed six times as she was locking up her
bicycle behind the Casa Loma Hotel in Tempe. Later the same night,
17-year-old Jane Bernstein was in ed in her family's house in New
Jersey when she heard the telephone ring in her parents' bedroom.
Like a voyeur, she sneaked to their door and pressed her ear to it.
``Are you sure? Are you positive?'' she heard her mother say. Then
her mother hung up and said, ``Our baby is dead.'' In 1989, Jane
Bernstein came to Phoenix to see the place where her sister was
murdered for no reason, and for the next five years, she thought of
little else. This is her memoir, the story of a woman's troubled
life in the shadow of her sister's death, equal parts obsession and
avoidance. She writes of the murderer, a man named David Mumbaugh,
who died in prison in 1993. She was sad for him, she says _ ``not
sorry for him, but sad at the way this had turned out for all of
us.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``FAIR BALL'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Bob Costas (Broadway, $21.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The oft-quoted Jacques Barzun line goes, ``Whoever wants to know
the heart and mind of America had better learn baseball.'' Bob
Costas is not convinced. ``All I can say, really, is that Jacques
Barzun scares me a little bit,'' he writes. Costas is not the
baseball romantic he's often made out to be. He's a Bull Durham guy
who never liked that other Kevin Costner movie about the gam e. And
he's here to remind you that on Opening Day 2000, the sport began
its seventh season as a dysfunctional operation, that fans were
``gamely hanging on out of loyalty, memory and sheer faith, long
after baseball itself had ceased to care much about any of that.''
He offers a cogent analysis of what went wrong and what might make
it right, and he hopes people have the will to read it. As he
points out, if Bobby Thomson's home run happened today, here's how
Russ Hodges would call it: ``The Giants win the pennant!! The
Giants win the pennant!! The Dodgers get the wild card!! The
Dodgers get the wild card!!''Isn't that exciting? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``AMERICAN POETRY: THE TWENTIETH CENTURY'' &QL; 
 &UR; (Library of America, $35 each) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is Dorothy Parker on Alfred Lord Tennyson: ``Should heaven
send me any son,/ I hope he's not like tennyson./ I'd rather have
him play a fiddle/ Than rise and bow and speak an idyll.'' We never
miss a chance to quote her, even when she's among more quotable
company. We also were happy to find Don Marquis here with archy and
mehitabel _ every collection of poetry needs a cockroach in it,
just to keep it honest. These are the first two volumes in a
four-volume set and include work written by poets born before 1914.
Organized by the poets' birth dates, there are multiple
contributions from the big guns _ Robert Frost, William Carlos
Williams, Carl Sandburg, Ezra Pound, e.e. cummings _ and surprise
showings by people such as Joe Hill, Ma Rainey, Cole Porter, Edith
Wharton, Bessie Smith and Tennessee Williams. They begin with Henry
Adams and end with May Swenson, and it's a long, pleasant journey
between.  &QL;

CANDIDATE VICENTE FOX IS SHAKING UP MEXICO'S PRESIDENTIAL RACE

<P>
   &UR; JIQUILPAN, Mexico _ Nearly 500 students exploded in cheers as
the tall presidential candidate in the light blue shirt arrived at
the Instituto Tecnologico de Jiquilpan in this town in the central
state of Michoacan.
</P>
<P>
   The students had been waiting for 90 minutes in the sun, but
their enthusiasm was undimmed. Vi-cen-te! Vi-cen-te! they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox broke into a wide grin, put on a school T-shirt,
then took the microphone in his hand and held it to his face like a
rock star.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of improving education, of `bringing this country up to
date` and moving it into the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, midway through his 20-minute speech, the candidate turned
confrontational. He asked the students to ``help build a tomb for
Little Cuauhtemoc.'' The crowd laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was referring to Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential
contender of a center-left coalition who had once governed
Michoacan. Cardenas' father, Lazaro who ruled Mexico in the 1920s
and is widely considered the country's best-loved president, was
born in Jiquilpan.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's swipe at the Cardenas legacy was so incendiary that it
made national news. The remark was pure Fox, a bit of the blunt
style that has made the candidate the most controversial politician
in Mexico these days.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, Mexico will hold its most competitive presidential
election in itshistory. The overriding issue facing voters is
whether to oust the Institutiona Revolutionary Party (PRI), which
has ruled Mexico for 71 years, making the nation the world's
longest-running one-party regime. The election is Mexico's version
of Berlin in 1989, or Chile's plebiscite on Augusto Pinochet in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the candidate from the center-right National Action Party
(PAN), has thebest chance of doing that, analysts and opinion polls
suggest. After trailing b as many as 10 percentage points in polls
earlier this year, some polls show Fox now virtually tied with PRI
candidate Francisco Labastida. Others show him trailing by about 7
points.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, who many Mexicans believe lost a 1988 presidential bid
to the PRI candidate through widespread fraud, consistently places
a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   As Mexico breaks from decades of undisputed PRI rule, other
parts of Mexican society are becoming active. Grass-roots,
neighborhood and environmental groups the news media, the church
and the business elite are taking on social and political roles
that they once left to the massive PRI regime.
</P>
<P>
   For many Mexicans, Fox, who turns 58 on Election Day,
personifies this unpolished, non-governmental Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A rancher and former president of Coca-Cola de Mexico, he comes
from both therural and cosmopolitan sides of the country. His stump
speech focuses on helpin small businesses. As Guanajuato's
governor, he set up a micro-banking system primarily to serve poor
women that now has 40,000 clients and has been copied in other
states. He wears a suit and tie on occasion but usually sports an
open-collar blue shirt, cowboy boots and a large ``FOX'' belt
buckle. At 6 feet 6 inches, he usually stands a full head above his
crowd. He can speak Spanish like a farmer and English like a New
York banker. He is the grandson of an Irish immigrant; his father
was a Mexican rancher, and his mother was born in Spain. He is a
divorced Catholic and father of four adopted children. He advocates
secular education yet used a picture of the Virgin of Guadalupe in
his campaign until the country's election board told him to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he shows that the great myths of Mexican politics are
being discarded,'' says Jesus Silva-Herzog Marquez, a political
scientist at the ITAM, a private university in Mexico City. These
include ``the anti-entrepreneurial myth, in which being a
successful entrepreneur within Mexican politics was shameful, and
there was no bridge between politics and the business world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox has taken on these subjects and this hasn't created any
problems,'' Silva-Herzog says.
</P>
<P>
   On a stop with touring motorcyclists, the candidate rode a
Harley in a helmet and leather jacket _ a jarring sight for
Mexicans used to decades of staid politicians in business suits.
The stunt earned him the cover of the ``Proroceso'' newsweekly.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign speeches are often full of details of his
proposals, and at times he risks losing his audience. At a rally in
Pinos, Zacatecas, a small ranching town, Fox declared, ``I know
your dreams, of how many hopes you sow when you plant the ground,''
then launched a discourse on municipal reform, inflation reduction
and loan programs for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   About every week or two this year, Fox has uttered something to
shock the Mexican body politic. Last month, he bent back the index
finger of his ictory ``V,'' to leave the erect middle finger,
telling a crowd that it was Labastida's sign. To Protestant
ministers in January, he drew parallels between the Catholic Church
and the PRI, making the point that both had held a monopoly on
power in Mexico. In February, he called Labastida a mariqueta (a
sissy) and an ``electoral pirate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is used to a very velveted way of political speaking,''
says Silva-Herzog. ``Socially, we use this very roundabout way of
speaking. This tone is what the politician uses who speaks very
sweetly, who uses many ambiguous references. It's a tone that I
think now expresses the distance between politicians and Mexican
society. (Fox's style) confirms him as the representative of a
different way of doing politics.''
</P>
<P>
   That style appears to alienate some of those whose support Fox
will need to win. The same polls that show him inching closer to
Labastida also show that half of the voters consider Fox
``impulsive,'' hardly a good thing for a politician in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Edna Jaime, a political scientist at the Mexico City think tank
CIDAC, says that often his style clashes with Mexicans' highly
conservative approach to politics. Polls and recent elections have
shown that Mexicans ``want ch ange, but they don't want to run any
risk,'' Jaime says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally contradictory. They want change, but they're not
willing to run the most minimal risk,'' she adds. ``So Vicente Fox
needs to sell a message of certainty. But he's not doing that
because he's very volatile in his words and actions. He's not
generating certainties.
</P>
<P>
   `In spite of that, he's got at least 32 percent of the vote,
according to his lowest poll numbers, and others show him with
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Fox style has proven attractive in a country used to
silver-tongued politicians who never say what they mean, says
Carlos Castillo Peraza, a former National Action Party president
and now a newspaper columnist.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it's reached its limit,'' Castillo Peraza says.
``Now he's got to make a strong effort to present himself as a
statesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's plain speaking, more characteristic of entrepreneurs than
politi cians, is a sign that he came to politics from business. Fox
worked his way up from the bottom at Coca-Cola de Mexico. In 1974,
at age 32, Fox was made president of the company for Mexico and
Central America. Five years later, he was to be promoted to
director of Coca-Cola for Latin America. But because he didn't want
an international career, he resigned to return home to Guanajuato
to help manage his family's ranch and boot business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Manuel Clouthier was the PAN's candidate for president.
Clouthier was a businessman and attracted many other formerly
apolitical businessmen to the party. These neopanistas, as they're
known, energized the party. They have since become governors and
mayors and pushed the party from a sleepy bastion of bluebloods and
far-right ideologues into a more centrist and pragmatic
institution. Fox was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, at Clouthier's urging, he ran for Congress and won. In
1991, he ran for governor of Guanajuato and lost. However, the
election was rife with fraud. Civic protest forced the victorious
PRI candidate to vacate his seat in favor of a negotiated third
candidate from the PAN. In 1995, Fox ran again for g overnor and
won.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few years, he was mentioned often as a likely
presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one was expecting it when, in 1998, he changed Mexican
politics by announcing he was running for president. This was two
years before the election.
</P>
<P>
   For Mexico, it was a radical precedent. It upset the
usually-staid PAN, which was used to a certain decorum; no one had
ever announced so early. He eventually scared away all other
potential candidates and won the party's nomination unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI also was forced to change. Soon its members were
announcing that they too were running. This was unheard of in a
party where rivals humbly held their tongues awaiting the
president's decision, only weeks before the filing deadline, as to
who would be the candidate. The PRI made a virtue of ne cessity,
held a presidential primary in November and heralded it as a sign
that the party was now democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He established a new electoral calendar,'' Castillo Peraza
said. ``For the first time in its history, the PAN had only one
candidate. But this took an argument away from the PAN, the
argument that the PRI isn't democratic. It made it easy for the PRI
to say they were the democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, his reputation as an outsider and a doer
while governor of Guanajuato has given the PAN an opening to voters
it never had before: the small farmers, the urban poor and the
young who once supported Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardenas doesn't convince us anymore,'' said Ricardo Anaya, a
23-year-old industrial-engineering student in Jiquilpan. ``He's
lost twice before. Fox is the candidate who pays attention to young
people.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the school stop in Jiquilpan, Fox was speaking
in the impoverished Indian village of Tarecuato, where people speak
their native Purepecha as much as Spanish. No National Action Party
candidate had ever held a rally in Tarecuato, villagers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Mexico that isn't heard,'' he boomed across a
plaza half-filled with shoeless boys with rotting teeth, grizzled
men in white cowboy hats and wrinkled old women in blue shawls.
``I'm not a politician. I was born on a ranch and worked all my
life, just like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that the PRI's 40 percent hard-core vote is largely
rooted in such poor rural communities. And political observers say
that grabbing a piece of that vote will be necessary, though
extremely difficult, for Fox to win the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're at a disadvantage,'' Fox said. ``We know among
the poorest people is where the PRI has its controlled reserve of
votes. The job is to keep working in those places. That's what
we're doing.'' &QL;

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Sixty-nine percent of the world's
victims of HIV and AIDS are in sub-Saharan Africa. This figure is
not easy to take in. AIDS seems to have come upon everyone while we
were looking the other way: it happened to some sex or color other
than our own; it was endemic to some other country.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa it was quite some time before the realization
that the disease was not the unfortunate problem of our poorer
neighboring countries, but was our own. Now, out of South Africa's
43 million people, about 4 million have been infected by HIV and a
further 1,700 are infected daily. Recently, in a Johannesburg home
caring for orphaned or abandoned babies born with AIDS, there was a
service in memory of 40 who had died there not long before. While
South Africa is the most highly developed country on the African
continent, we are faced with this kind of future for the
generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   But every community, every affected country, has to decide how
to approach what is no longer a problem but a catastrophe. There is
prevention, and there is cure. The ideal is to seek both at once,
but this is beyond the capacity of most countries where the disease
is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Cure, and prevention by inoculation, are not within the capacity
of lay people; these are in the hands of medical science, which
implies money to be provided to advance research. Immediate
prevention is in the hands and initiative of each population
itself.
</P>
<P>
   I believe we cannot emphasize bluntly enough that the cure and
vaccine development depend on money. And until recently, the
country that has the money, the United States, perhaps inevitably
has concentrated on a vaccine for a subtype of AIDS prevalent in
the Northern Hemisphere. It was only at the World Economic Forum's
meeting this year that President Clinton announced that large-scale
aid for vaccine development would be forthcoming from the United
States. Only now has the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative
announced a third international development project, based on those
subtypes of the virus most prevalent in the direly affected regions
of Southern and East Africa, the subtypes C and A.
</P>
<P>
   It is encouraging that the project is being pursued in wide
collaboration among researchers of the United States, South Africa,
Kenya and Oxford University, and that the philosophy of the
initiative is that of ``social venture capital,'' meaning that in
return for financing, it has secured rights to ensure that a
successful vaccine, when it is achieved, will be distributed in
developing countries ``at a reasonable price.'' The formation of an
International Partnership Against HIV/AIDS in Africa is to be
welcomed as extremely important in the same context.
</P>
<P>
   The question of money _ price _ is vital in terms of the
palliatives available to arrest the disease and alleviate symptoms.
It is another piercing example of the gulf between the world's rich
and the world's poor that the suffering from AIDS may be
alleviated, and even the lives prolonged, of those victims who can
afford expensive treatment. The same principle applies to
prevention. Everywhere in Africa moral and humanitarian decisions
are a common dilemma, with money the deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   At the level of international _ global _ responsibility, the
total sum needed annually for AIDS prevention in Africa is on the
order of $2.3 billion. Africa currently receives only $165 million
a year in official assistance from the world community.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions that rest with the world community become
relevant: debt relief for developing countries, for example. The
director-general of the World Health Organization said last year
that debt relief should be reviewed in light of the resources that
governments with large debts need to confront HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The role of governments in financing is another example. Where
does the defense budget not far exceed the public health budget to
combat AIDS? Nevertheless, what HIV and AIDS mean to the capability
to govern, ultimately, was revealed in South Africa by the minister
of public service and administration in February.
</P>
<P>
   The public service is the largest employer in the country and
the fundamental government structure. In 1999, one in eight South
Africans was HIV-positive. It is estimated that 270,000 out of 1.1
million public servants could be infected by 2004. This looming
crisis in governance exists almost everywhere on the African
continent. If, in developing countries, defense budgets continue to
leave HIV budgets relegated to a footnote, all we shall have left
to defend in the end is a graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is not only a health catastrophe, a challenge to medical
science. It is socially enmeshed in the conditions of life that
obtain while it spreads, just as the medieval plague was in its
time. Although AIDS is no respecter of class or caste, slum
conditions, ignorance and superstition (it is a white man's
disease; it is a black man's disease) make the poor its greatest
source of victims.
</P>
<P>
   In working to prevent the spread of the virus, we must accept
the idea that promiscuity is difficult to condemn when sex is the
cheapest or only available satisfaction for people society leaves
to live on the street. On another socioeconomic level, casual sex
thrives among young people who are materially privileged yet whom
society has failed to endow with the real values of human
sexuality, the knowledge that fulfillment involves contact with the
other's personality, that the sexual act is not some mere bodily
function like evacuation _ which is what some campaigners seem to
reduce it to.
</P>
<P>
   There are subtleties, important ones, connected with any
campaign against HIV and AIDS, if it is to succeed in changing
attitudes toward sexual mores. For there will be a cure discovered,
there will be a vaccine _ and after that? How shall we restore the
quality of human relations that have been debased, shamed, reduced
to the source of a fatal disease? The free condom dispenser is not
the panacea. Neither, alone, is sex education restricted to
anatomical diagrams and dire warnings in schools. The entire
meaningfulness of personal sexual relations will need to be
restored. That is what social health means, along with inoculation
and survival.
</P>
<P>
   Self-interest cannot be discounted. So, to the developed world,
a pragmatic word from the stricken African continent: Call not to
ask for whom the stock exchange bell tolls and the figures on the
computer sound the alarm _ the toll is for Europe, for the United
States, even for those countries where HIV and AIDS victims are
few. For if the markets and vast potential markets for the
developed world's goods fail _ if decimated populations mean there
is no one left economically active with money to spend _ that bell
tolls for thee, globally.
</P>
<P>
   HIV/AIDS is everyone's disaster. It has, finally, something to
do with our whole manner of existence. It confronts us with
questions that must be answered historically: What have we done
with the world, politically? What are we doing with the world? What
do we mean by development? Some Ugandans who had been in the
audience of an AIDS information play were asked what message it had
brought them. One said, ``Don't go out with bar girls.'' Another
said, ``Stick to one partner.'' Then an older woman said: ``AIDS
has come to haunt a world that thought it was incomplete. Some
wanted children, some wanted money, some wanted property, and all
we ended up with is AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she spoke for Africa.

THE PLANE THAT NOBODY WANTED

<P>
   Grounding the remaining 12 V-22 Osprey airplanes, after the
crash that killed 19 Marines this weekend, is only the beginning of
what the Pentagon and Congress should do. Immediately, the
government should stop production of any more new Ospreys. This
plane should never have been built; three of the 15 that have been
delivered so far have already been lost in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey, a tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off and lands like
a helicopter but flies like a plane, was conceived two decades ago,
at the height of the Cold War, as a joint Army-Marine Corps plane.
In the '80s and '90s, high-level officials from the Reagan, Bush
and Clinton administrations all recommended canceling it. Their
objections, which have been echoed by the General Accounting
Office, were that the V-22 is too expensive and too technologically
troubled.
</P>
<P>
   Present plans call for building 458 Ospreys for $37.3 billion,
or more than $80 million apiece for a plane that carries just 24
Marines. This is twice as much as an F-16 fighter plane and about
the same as the projected cost of another new plane, the joint
strike fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The original recommendation to cancel the Osprey was in 1986,
when the Pentagon budget was 40 percent higher than it is now and
the cost of a single V-22 was estimated at $24 million, with 923
aircraft to be built.
</P>
<P>
   The project was actually canceled in 1989 by the Bush
administration _ by that time the unit cost had risen to $35
million, with 602 planes to be built, and the Army had dropped out
of the program. But Congress, concerned about the loss of 125,000
jobs, kept the V-22 alive.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton championed
it, offering the rather far-fetched reasoning that it would have
not only military value but also commercial applications, notably
as a solution to traffic congestion in larger cities. In the waning
days of the 1992 election, President Bush, in a desperate attempt
to win Texas, also changed his mind about the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Once in office, President Clinton endorsed building the plane
even though his deputy secretary of defense, John Deutch, had
recommended canceling it and the commercial sector had withdrawn
from the project.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the program were canceled, the Marine Corps could still
get some return for the tens of billions of dollars invested by
fielding the existing V-22s to develop innovative tactics. This is
what the Air Force did with the one squadron of B-2 bombers that
was built before that wasteful program was scrapped. As for
transporting soldiers and equipment, the Marines could buy Army
Blackhawk helicopters at one-sixth the cost of Ospreys.
</P>
<P>
   Canceling the V-22 now would also free up money for more
critical uses. Gen. James Jones, the Marine Corps commandant, has
said that despite the $30 billion rise in the defense budget in the
last two years, this year the Marines are short $1.4 billion for
improving pay and conditions for personnel, modernizing repair
shops and maintaining and improving equipment. Canceling the V-22
in the 2001 budget would more than pay for those items. Cutting the
V-22 would also help the Pentagon deal with a coming threat to its
aircraft budget as $400 billion in other planned new airplanes
begins to come due.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping the Osprey before it goes any further would also be in
keeping with the sensible argument (espoused by George W. Bush,
among others) that with the end of the Cold War, the United States
should skip a generation of producing new aircraft and put the
money into research. The country can do better for its money than
it is doing with the Osprey.

   BALTIMORE _ The United States is largely to blame for the
suffering of Afghan women under the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
   It was U.S. action that brought the Taliban to power, and the
Taliban could be removed if the United States and the United
Nations had the will to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the opinions of activists working to help the women.
Since the Taliban militia captured Kabul in 1996, girls have been
prevented from attending school. Women lost their jobs as doctors,
lawyers, teachers and government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Women are under virtual house arrest, prohibited from leaving
their homes unless they're accompanied by a male relative. This
rule is especially hard on the 300,000 wid ows in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When women do go outside, they must be covered from head to toe
with a shroud with only a small piece of mesh over the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They can be beaten for showing an ankle. They lack health care
because male doctors are forbidden from treating women patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, activists lobbied for sup port of Afghan women at
Feminist Expo 2000, an international gather ing of women's rights
advocates in Baltimore that drew about 6,000 women and men from
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the convention was Zieba Shorish-Shamley,
director of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in
Afghanistan. She criticizes the United States for aban doning
Afghanistan after the Soviets ended their occupation in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Russia withdrew, the U.S. lost interest, and that's the
time we needed the U.S. the most,'' Shorish-Shamley said ``That's
when foreign, neighboring countries (such as Paki stan), each with
their own interest, moved in and started supporting different
factions.''
</P>
<P>
   She's angry that the CIA supported the rebels during Soviet
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban _ Pakistan trained it; Saudi Arabia financed it;
and the U.S. blessed it,''Shorish-Stamley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cash, arms, food and medicine for the rebels were channeled from
the United States through the Pakistani intelligence service, said
Philip Smith, director of research and analysis for a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank, the Center for Public Policy Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was staff director for the Congressional Task Force on Af
ghanist an from 1988 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We more or less deferred to them (Pakistani intelligence), and
that was a big mistake,'' Smith said. ``U.S. policy changed
dramatically when bombs went off (at U.S. embassies in 1998) in Dar
es Salaam as well as Nairobi. At that point, I think policymakers
smelled the coffee. Prior to that, they often looked the other way
when fundamentalists were seizing control of Afghani stan.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States blamed Osama Bin Laden for the embassy
bombings and retaliated by bombing what it said was a chemical
factory in the Sudan and three training camps of Bin Laden's in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Clinton administration is prepared to bomb Afghanistan
over Bin Laden, why don't we start pushing the international
community (on behalf of Afghan women)?? asked T. Kuman, an
executive with Amnesty international.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't the U.S. and other countries put pressure on the
three countries that recognize the Taliban _ Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates?''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has become more interested in Afghanistan
because of the oil and gas in former Soviet republics,
Shorish-Shamley said.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Unocal joined a consortium with oil companies
from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia with the idea of building a pipeline
from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan to Pakistan. Unocal dropped
out in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Leno, activist and wife of comedian Jay Leno, wants the
United States to pressure Pakistan to stop supporting the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it clear to our governments that for the rest of their
lives, every time they look in the rear-view mirror, they'll see
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, governments and busi nesses should pressure the
Taliban the way they pressured South Africa to end racial
apartheid, said Deb Ellis, author of the soon-to-be-pub lished book
``Women of the Afghan War.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advocate, who asks to be identified only as Sajeda, is
angry at the U.S. government for getting involved during the Soviet
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Afghan people fought the British (gaining its independence
in 1919). Afghanistan could have de feated the Russians without the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   She also feels betrayed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.N. can send peacekeepers to East Timor to pave the
way for ademocratic election, why can't they do it in Afghanistan?
They say, `We must be invited by the government,' but since there
is no government in Afghanistan, that's just an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hassina Sherjan-Samad, founder of Children's Voice,
traveled to Kabul, where, escorted by the Taliban, she visited
classrooms, filled only with boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person with me asked one of the boys if there were any
differences between men and women. This boy, about 12 or 15, said,
`Women have 9 million brain cells, and men have 15 million brain
cells.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was asked, `How do you know?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Physics proved it.' This is what they teach.'' Reach

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After years of late-night dinners, indulging in
steaks and sweets as eager lobbyists picked up the tab, state Sen.
Thomas W. Libous won many a friend but lost his svelte figure. Then
he embraced a sure-fire diet: a new code of ethics.

   Along with the rest of his Senate colleagues, he swore off the

   ``I can honestly tell you, I don't miss it a bit,'' said Libous,
R-Binghamton, who has served for 12 years. ``I'm enjoying this new
life in which I can control what I do in the evening _ and what I
can eat.''
</P>
<P>
   In these flush times, the Legislature has become a leaner place.
Stung by embarrassing revelations that Philip Morris treated scores
of lawmakers to meals and gifts last year and then underreported
the expense, the Republican-controlled Senate adopted a voluntary
ban on lobbyists' gifts of meals and items worth more than $25. The
Democratic-led Assembly refused to go along, though 12 of its
members have individually pledged to abide by the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy has produced a profound change in Albany's
longstanding political culture, where contacts were cultivated and
business was conducted over expensive dinners at a handful of
favored restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   While there is still lobbying, the places, the styles, and, in
some cases, the amount of money involved have shifted so
drastically that the new culture has become the subject of
whispers, complaints and even jokes around the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Now, senators can be seen munching sandwiches at their desks,
cooking for one another at night and making do with pizza and
Chinese takeout. As lobbyists with platinum credit cards have
canceled their standing dinner reservations, the most pricey
restaurants have gone begging for customers. ``Ogden's business has
been severely affected by this change,'' said Alfred McCormick,
whose Ogden's restaurant has served the Capitol crowd since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to tell, of course, how devoutly these
legislators are following the new regimen, and several critics are
skeptical about their willpower. ``I can tell you that they're
grumbling about it, saying it's not fair and it's pointless, and
some of them probably are eating on the sly,'' said one senior
legislative aide who asked not to be named because the issue has
become so sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Others question whether the ban on free meals and gifts would
make any real difference in the political process. They say it is
no coincidence that lobbyists are showing up more often at
fund-raising events these days, plying lawmakers with $500 campaign
donations instead of $100 dinners. ``I don't think it's made things
better for the public,'' said Norman Adler, a lobbyist who manages
campaigns for several senators. ``Money is still being expended by
interest groups on behalf of legislation. It's just a different
venue.''
</P>
<P>
   But even so, Libous' shrinking waistline is just one indication
that a deeply entrenched lobbying culture has begun to change.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of special interest groups and their lobbyists are
chafing nervously under a new lobbying law passed by the
Legislature last year that toughens disclosure requirements and
increases penalties for violations. Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz,
Edelman &AMP; Dicker, the highest-paid lobbying firm in the state, has
canceled its annual group dinners with freshman members of the
Senate and the Assembly. Others have taken back complimentary gifts
to avoid any hint of impropriety that could mire them, or the
legislators, in another lobbying scandal.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the New York chapter of the AAA auto club has long
bestowed honorary memberships, worth about $45, on 100 or so
legislators. But Dennis J. Crossley, the chapter's executive vice
president, said he was considering ending the practice next year
because more than one-third of the current memberships had been
declined or belatedly paid for by legislators. ``There are a lot of
gray areas,'' he said. ``I think many of them are erring on the
side of caution.''

</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, a number of special interest groups like labor
unions are finding other ways to spend their money. Instead of
splurging on dinners and gifts for legislators, they are investing
in television and radio ads and sophisticated marketing tools like
focus groups and telephone banks to win over their constituents. In
New York, the lobbying industry as a whole reported spending $12.2
million on advertising last year, compared with just $1.4 million
for social events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about what happens in the halls of Albany, it's about
what happens in people's living rooms, that resonates in a far
stronger way,'' said Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, the health
workers' union, which set a precedent for high-stakes lobbying last
year by mounting a multimillion-dollar advertising and marketing
campaign to help assure passage of an ambitious health care
program.
</P>
<P>
   Most special interest groups and lobbyists lack such deep
pockets, however, and must rely on more traditional means of
persuasion. To that end, the endless dinners at coat-and-tie places
like Ogden's and Nicole's Bistro were not just to curry favor with
legislators but also to plead their cases for an hour or two away
from the harried pace of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole Philip Morris thing created a picture that only big
business lobbies, and that's not true,'' said Libous, who used to
dine with lobbyists once or twice a week. ``Everyone lobbies. To
us, it wasn't a big deal. It was a much bigger deal to the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1996, Philip Morris treated more than 100 current
and former legislators, along with aides and other officials, to
meals and other gifts but failed to report them to the State
Lobbying Commission, as required by law. The company was fined
$75,000 and its chief lobbyist was barred from lobbying the state
government for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the state Senate adopted the voluntary ban on meals from
lobbyists, a number of its members have declared that they never
liked all that whining and dining anyway. ``I don't have the
tolerance for listening to long, painful stories at dinner,'' said
Sen. Nicholas A. Spano, R-Westchester County, who prefers to cook
for his colleagues in his Albany apartment. ``It wasn't an ethics
thing, it was indigestion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics pointed out that the Senate was in no hurry
before to give up the free meals _ and the Assembly still has not
done so. The Senate minority leader, Martin Connor, a D-Brooklyn,
said Republican leaders never expected the lobbying reform efforts
to go so far, and adopted the voluntary meal-and-gift ban to head
off his own challenge to bind members with a formal Senate rule.
``The Republican majority benefited the most from the lobbying,''
he said. ``There was no way out of it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, declined to be
interviewed through his spokeswoman, Patricia Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the New York chapter of Common Cause, a nonprofit
advocacy group, sent letters to all 150 Assembly members asking
them to adopt the Senate's meal-and-gift ban. So far, 12 have
agreed, six have refused and the rest have ignored the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the culture in Albany is difficult to change, but this
is an opportunity,'' said Rachel Leon, the group's executive
director. ``If some of the senators are walking around lighter,
that may be evidence it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   But weight loss is not the only side effect of the lobbying
changes. Restaurant owners and waiters around downtown Albany have
lamented the sudden loss of one-third to one-half of their business
on weeknights. They say some of the regulars _ the lobbyists who
were on a first-name basis _ have stood them up. Fewer legislators
drop by, and when they do, they do not eat as freely as before.
</P>
<P>
   At Nicole's Bistro, where dozens of photographs of politicians
line the front wall, Nancy Calhoun was one of only two legislators
dining in the restaurant on a recent Tuesday evening. After
finishing her meal with a friend, Calhoun, a R-Orange and Rockland
counties, pulled out a torn piece of paper offering $15 off the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how lobbying has changed here,'' she said with a laugh.
``Members are going out on coupons.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The V-22 Osprey is a classic case of a military
program that would not be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The crash of an Osprey on Saturday night in Arizona, which
killed 19 Marines, came after years of arguments inside the
Pentagon against building the aircraft, and years of dogged efforts
by Congress to protect the $37 billion program.
</P>
<P>
   The military began flying the first five Ospreys six months ago
despite questions about the safety and cost of the hybrid aircraft,
designed to take off and land like a helicopter but cruise like an
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Defense Department officials tried to cancel the program
11 years ago: too expensive, too experimental, they said. Congress
refused. For four years running, Pentagon officials fought
Congress, trying to stop the Osprey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Navy Secretary Sean O'Keefe told the House Armed
Services Committee that the Pentagon would not spend $790 million
authorized by Congress to build three test aircraft. He said that
``the V-22 cannot be built to meet the requirements specified. It's
an engineering impossibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But Congress again defied the Defense Department, proclaiming
the aircraft to be a potential technological wonder before tests
had validated that claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology was a revolutionary concept that lit the
imagination of lawmakers, and the contractors fueled that fire,''
O'Keefe said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Marine commanders wanted it badly. They had developed no other
alternative to replace the Vietnam-era Chinook helicopter, and they
argued that Marine missions could not be adequately served by even
the newest Army helicopter. Members of Congress said the V-22 had
great commercial potential. And the contracts represented hundreds
of high-tech jobs across the country. Key congressmen, some of them
ex-Marines, dug in their heels.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., the staunchest advocate of the V-22,
Monday dismissed criticism of the aircraft with a barnyard epithet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who would come out now and question the program, they
don't know what they're talking about,'' he said in an interview.
``If there is a technological problem, which I highly doubt, let's
look at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Two test aircraft crashed in the early '90s; one of those
accidents, in 1992, killed nine men. The design of the Osprey has
evolved throughout the decade to reflect lessons learned from those
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Cooper, a long-time military aviation expert at the
Congressional Research Service who retired last month, said two
crashes while testing an aircraft ``do not tell us anything'' about
the aircraft. They are to be expected in testing a new military
system like the Osprey, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It will take weeks or months to determine whether the crash on
Saturday was caused by a design defect, a manufacturing flaw or
human error.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey's mission is to transport 20 to 24 fully armed
Marines, a larger number than can be carried by most military
helicopters, in and out of combat and on rescue missions. Marines
often ferry from ship to shore, and the corps argued for the Osprey
because it could fly farther and faster than a helicopter, but
still land in hot spots without the luxury of a runway.
</P>
<P>
   It has been in development for 18 years; its cost has grown
dramatically over time, partially due to the long fight over moving
the aircraft from the drawing board to the assembly line.
Government agencies outside the Pentagon place the cost today as
high as $60 million apiece. That raises doubts about its commercial
potential.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said Monday that it has not formally grounded the
Osprey, but the Marines will not fly the remaining four until they
understand what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident in the program because of the amount of
testing we've done and the number of hours we've flown it,'' said
Maj. Dave LaPan, a Marine Corps spokesman. ``We've really put this
aircraft through its paces.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Pentagon bowed to Congress and agreed to build
the aircraft, some of its officials, along with auditors from the
General Accounting Office, have warned that the Osprey's testing
was unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the accounting office reported that the aircraft's
major elements ``remain inadequate or untested.''
</P>
<P>
   That year, the Pentagon's inspector general said the aircraft
had gone into development ``without proper authorization'' and
without ``formal review'' _ the result, in part, of ``highly
unusual political factors.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Pentagon said the aircraft's prototypes could not
yet carry passengers or hover over unprepared landing zones. The
Defense Department also criticized the tests the aircraft was put
through as ``extremely artificial.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the GAO concluded that ``after 15 years of development
effort, the V-22 design has not been stabilized.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one ever developed an alternative aircraft. And its
potential, Marine commanders said, was too good to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft's prime contractors, the Boeing Co.'s helicopter
division, in Ridley Park, Pa., and Bell Helicopter Textron of Fort
Worth, Texas, carpeted Congress with data showing that the V-22
would work wonders _ and that parts of it would be built in 40
states.
</P>
<P>
   They persuaded a majority of members of Congress. And the
pressure from Congress to forge ahead never stopped. The supporters
included the most conservative Republicans and the most liberal
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   No one fought harder than Weldon, who represents the
Pennsylvania district that includes Boeing's helicopter division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a coalition that was broad and deep,'' Weldon said
Monday. ``We had the ex-Marines in Congress. We brought in the
retired Marine reserve officers' association. I brought in the
United Auto Workers and the civil aviation people.'' The latter
group promoted the idea that the aircraft had potential commercial
uses.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, the aviation expert, said, ``It does have range and
speed advantages. But is it worth it?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, said O'Keefe, the former Navy Secretary, now a
professor of business and government at Syracuse University. The
futuristic technology may not mesh with its more mundane mission,
he said, ``It's a bus to bring 20 people from ship to shore.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``revolutionary concept'' of the Osprey entranced Congress,
but has proven hard to realize, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was within the realm of the believable,'' O'Keefe said.
``But all the work that was needed to be done, to this day, it
hasn't been accomplished. This was something that required a little
more than pressing the envelope of technology.''

<P>
   CHEGUTU, Zimbabwe _ The black peasants stormed onto the white
farmer's land in March, demanding a chunk of the rustling fields of
tobacco and sweet corn, emboldened by President Robert Mugabe, who
blames the farmers for the slow pace of land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
   The squatters settled in, not realizing that Mugabe had already
tried and failed to seize the 4,000-acre farm, along with 1,400
other properties. He backed down when the owners protested and the
government found itself short of cash and unable to meet legal
deadlines. The government's actions, in 1997, were not reported in
the state-controlled newspaper, which applauds the squatters who
have invaded more than 900 farms.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in Mugabe's private and public postures is
telling. He talks tough, but takes a pragmatic approach, even a
conservative tack, in acquiring white-owned land, a close look at
his record shows. The issue of land reform is a central one in
Zimbabwe, where whites own more than half the fertile farms,
including 2 million acres of fallow land that Western donors say
could be better used by peasant farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated threats over 20 years, and a bitter campaign
for a constitutional amendment on the issue, the government has
never seized any property without paying for it, land experts and
commercial farmers say. In fact it has rarely used a tough law that
lets it delay payments up to five years; instead it has paid up
front. And when Mugabe's government has run short of cash,
officials have decided to slow the pace of redistribution.
</P>
<P>
   In March, while the government was boasting that it was about to
redistribute half of the country's white-owned commercial farmland,
officials were privately refusing to accept an available property
for sale. The government could not afford it, its lawyers admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The government's stance is surreal, said Rogier van den Brink,
an economist who represents the World Bank in Harare, the capital,
and who supports land distribution and praises the government's
respect of property rights. ``Despite all the talk and all the
threatening, on the ground the government has always followed the
law,'' he said, ``it hasn't taken any title deed for which it
hasn't paid cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Parliament approved a constitutional amendment early in April to
let the government seize land without compensation, but experts
like van den Brink doubt that even that will result in a spate of
land confiscation. For one thing, the government lacks the
administrative capacity to process many land transfers quickly. And
experts say the amendment is meant mainly to goad Western donors to
provide the money they pledged in 1998 for redistribution of almost
500,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The government also wants to appease rural constituents ahead of
national elections in May.
</P>
<P>
   In the heady days after independence two decades ago, Mugabe
promised a sweeping land reform. The initial plan was to resettle
162,000 black families on good land by the mid-1990s. But less than
half that number have actually been resettled. Land redistribution,
primarily financed by Britain, slowed considerably in the 1990s
when the government began offering long-term leases to the black
political elite, a development that made donors back away from the
program.
</P>
<P>
   White farmers stopped identifying underused land for purchase.
And as the economy unraveled, land reform sank in the government's
list of priorities, at least in private.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One elderly farmer, Alf Jackson, sued the ministry to try to
force the government to take his 4,700-acre farm, which it had
agreed to buy for $486,000. When officials tried to back out of the
deal, he sued, and in 1999, the Supreme Court ordered the
government to buy the land.
</P>
<P>
   But in March, even as Mugabe was blaming whites for blocking
land reform, his lawyers were sheepishly acknowledging they could
not afford Jackson's farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the calculation has been that they have to promise
high and deliver what is practical'' to the rural people eager for
good land, said Sam Moyo, who runs the Southern African Regional
Institute for Policy Studies in Harare. But he added: ``They're not
prepared to go to war to take land. They don't really believe in
destroying property rights.''
</P>
<P>
   And there have been hopeful signs about the program in the
future. Britain has agreed to discuss financing the government's
program. Mugabe, in turn, agreed to turn over to the poor some land
that had been given to officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has praised the squatters, disregarding the international
outcry and a local court order requiring their eviction. For their
part, officials at the Commercial Farmer Union, which represents
the white farmers, emphasize that the squatters have been
overwhelmingly peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers are going to court to see that squatters are told to
go home soon. The government is opposed to such a court order, on
the ground that it could cause violence.
</P>
<P>
   And meanwhile, at the farm in Chegutu, the invaders and the
invaded maintain a peaceful detente. The farmer, Jackie de Wet,
provides drinking water. In return, the landless men and women
promise to sleep in the grass, away from the house, where his
mother lives.
</P>
<P>
   The squatters are jobless young men, mothers who struggle to
feed their children, fathers who can no longer afford a bus ride to
town for a bag of corn meal. They build grass huts outside the
metal fence and are living on roasted ears of corn.
</P>
<P>
   De Wet says he sympathizes with their plight. ``These guys are
being used by the government as pawns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Mugabe's claim that blacks are ready to battle
whites for the soil, the squatters here say they have no intention
of fighting or harming de Wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to work with him,'' explained Japfumaneyi Masuko, 43,
who is hoping for a sliver of his fallow farmland. ``We want to
share.''

<P>
   Jhumpa Lahiri, a 33-year-old immigrant born in London and raised
in New England, won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction Monday for her
first book, a collection of stories evoking the isolation and
disconnection of South Asian immigrants in America.
</P>
<P>
   Lahiri, who won for ``Interpreter of Maladies'' (Mariner
Books/Houghton Mifflin), was the second immigrant author to win a
national fiction award in five months; in November, Ha Jin, a
Pulitzer finalist from China, won a National Book Award for his
novel ``Waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   A work of Asian history, John W. Dower's ``Embracing Defeat:
Japan in the Wake of World War II'' (W.W. Norton), won the Pulitzer
Prize for nonfiction. This comprehensive portrait of modern Japan
by Dower, a professor of history at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, also won a National Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   The journalism awards were dominated by The Washington Post,
which won three prizes, including the public service award, and The
Wall Street Journal, which won prizes for the ``Potomac Watch''
columns of Paul A. Gigot and for its staff's coverage of U.S.
defense spending in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   The Village Voice, a free New York City weekly, won the prize
for international reporting for Mark Schoofs' series on AIDS in
Africa, which Schoofs called a ``catastrophe that is transforming
the continent forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, its writers Sang-Hun Choe, Charles J.
Hanley and Martha Mendoza, and its researcher, Randy Herschaft, won
the investigative reporting award for piecing together, more than
45 years later, details of an American massacre of civilians during
the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The Post won the public service award for its coverage of the
abuse and neglect of the mentally retarded in group homes in the
District of Columbia, in a series spearheaded by Katherine Boo.
Henry Allen of The Post won the award for criticism for his ``fresh
and authoritative'' writing on photography. And Carol Guzy, Michael
Williamson and Lucian Perkins won the feature photography award for
coverage of Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Post's photography award was the only prize given for
coverage of the Kosovo conflict, which was one of the biggest
events of 1999. But the coverage of the wrenching mass shooting at
Colorado's Columbine High School brought Denver's daily newspapers
two awards.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Post won the award for breaking news for its ``clear
and balanced'' coverage of the student massacre. The Rocky Mountain
News photography staff won for breaking news photography for its
``emotional images.''
</P>
<P>
   George Dohrmann of the St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press, whose
reporting on widespread academic fraud in the men's basketball
program at the University of Minnesota provoked local outrage, won
for beat reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The prize for explanatory reporting was awarded to Eric Newhouse
of The Great Falls Tribune in Montana for his examination of
alcoholism and its consequences. J.R. Moehringer of The Los Angeles
Times won for feature writing, and Joel Pett of The Lexington
Herald-Leader in Kentucky won for editorial cartooning.
</P>
<P>
   The whiff of controversy that sometimes accompanies the awards
process was absent this year, but there were echoes of controversy
in other quarters _ particularly within The Associated Press, which
labored for months over the Korean massacre account. The delay in
getting the story out, coming in the months after CNN retracted its
controversial ``Tailwind'' report, angered the reporters involved,
but the editors defended it as simple and appropriate thoroughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of the story and the strength of our
reporting left no doubt in our minds that our story would
eventually get out,'' Hanley said. He added, ``The delay that did
occur was largely unwarranted, in the view of the journalists
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Wolman, the AP's managing editor, said, ``We are extremely
proud of the editorial process that produced such a meticulous and
valuable piece of work.''
</P>
<P>
   The editorial writing award was given to John C. Bersia of The
Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel, for his campaign against predatory lending
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Pulitzer Prize for drama was awarded to the playwright
Donald Margulies, who teaches play writing and screenwriting at
Yale University, for ``Dinner with Friends,'' a tragicomedy about
the vicissitudes of marriage in middle age. The award for biography
was given to Stacy Schiff for ``Vera (Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov)''
(Random House).
</P>
<P>
   The prize for a work of American history was awarded to David M.

DISABLED STUDENT IS SUING OVER TEST-SCORE LABELING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., spelling vonMayrhauser is CQ) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Breimhorst cannot take tests the way other students do: He
has no hands.
</P>
<P>
   So when he was applying to business schools in 1998, Breimhorst
received permission from the Educational Testing Service to take
the Graduate Management Admissions Test on a computer with a
trackball, and was given 25 percent more time to accommodate his
disability.
</P>
<P>
   Under the longstanding policy of the testing service, his
results were mailed out with the notation, ``Scores Obtained Under
Special Conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Breimhorst, a 29-year-old graduate of Stanford University, was
not admitted to business school. Now, in a federal lawsuit that
could affect hundreds of thousands of students with disabilities,
he is challenging the way the testing service flags the scores of
students who use accommodations to take the exams. The lawsuit
asserts that such flagging is a kind of scarlet letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a suspicion that their scores are less valid than
others, stigmatizing students with disabilities in exactly the way
the Americans with Disabilities Act is supposed to prevent,'' said
Josh Konecky, the lawyer for Disability Rights Advocates, the
nonprofit law group in Oakland, Calif., that represents Breimhorst.
``It's a national problem that people in the disability community
have talked about for years.''
</P>
<P>
   In its materials, the testing service explains that the
special-conditions notation is there because ``when standardized
tests such as the GMAT are taken under nonstandard conditions, the
scores may not accurately reflect the test-taker's educational
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   And the testing service says it has an obligation to flag the
scores so that school admissions offices will not be misled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's educationally valid to tell those who rely on
our reports that the scores were not achieved under standard
conditions,'' said Stan vonMayrhauser, the general counsel at the
testing service. ``We've thought about what feels right, we're
comfortable with what we're doing, and we feel confident that
reporting the true facts of how a test was taken is not illegal or
discriminatory.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has issued little guidance on when it is
acceptable to flag test scores, leaving the legal issue murky.
</P>
<P>
   ``People argue persuasively on both sides,'' said Robert
Schaeffer, the public education director of FairTest, a Cambridge,
Mass., organization that is critical of standardized testing
practices. ``On one hand, it appears to be true that scores on
time-extended tests are not equivalent to those taken without
accommodations. On the other side, it is an absolute red flag, and
college admissions people admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become more pressing as the number of requests for
accommodations increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are going up for two reasons,'' said Diana Pullin,
an education law professor at Boston College. ``More people with
physical disabilities are surviving and gaining access to higher
education, and more people with learning disabilities are
exercising their rights. And with the trend toward more high-stakes
testing, I think we'll see a lot more litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The testing service grants, and flags, thousands of
accommodations each year on the SAT, the Graduate Management
Admissions Test, the Graduate Records Exam and dozens of other
tests. On the SAT's alone, more than 24,000 students had some kind
of accommodation last year, ranging from blind students taking the
test in Braille to easily distracted students allowed to take the
test in a separate room.
</P>
<P>
   The largest, fastest-growing and most controversial group of
disabled students _ almost 9 out of 10 of those receiving
accommodations _ are those with attention deficit disorder or
learning disabilities like dyslexia.
</P>
<P>
   Many testing experts say it is difficult to know precisely what
accommodations they should give people with disabilities: What will
level the playing field and not give them an advantage?
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters further is the increasing awareness that
accommodations for learning disabilities are sought less frequently
by poor black or Hispanic students than by white children from
affluent schools.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the accommodations granted _ for physical or learning
disabilities _ involve extended time.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to defuse the issue, many experts suggest, would
be to make all tests untimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make a decision that a test doesn't have to be
timed, you can eliminate most of the requests for accommodations,
and the problem goes away,'' Pullin said.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer of FairTest said that untimed tests tended to raise
everyone's scores _ and give an edge to female test-takers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the College Board, which sponsors the SAT, only
about 2 percent of those who receive accommodations on the SAT do
not get extended time, perhaps just using a large-type version of
the test, or having a separate room in which to take it. The
testing service does not flag those scores, the board said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we stopped flagging those results based on research
in the 1980s suggesting that accommodations that did not involve
extended time did not affect the validity of the scores,'' said
vonMayrhauser.
</P>
<P>
   Breimhorst's lawsuit charges that the testing service has no
evidence for concluding that the scores of disabled people who
receive accommodations are less reliable or valid than the scores
of those who take the test without accommodations. The service's
flagging policy, the complaint says, makes the scores of disabled
people less valuable than those of others, and violates the
Americans With Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.
</P>
<P>
   Two advocacy groups, the International Dyslexia Association and
Californians for Disability Rights, are also plaintiffs in
Breimhorst's suit, filed last summer in federal district court in
the Northern District of California.
</P>
<P>
   The testing service sought to have the case dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But on March 27, Judge William Orrick refused the request,
writing that the federal laws ``require the test provider to take
steps to best ensure that the tests equally measure the skills of
disabled and nondisabled test takers.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the judge said, ``If test providers meet this
burden, then there would be no reason to flag the test results of
disabled test takers who receive accommodations.''
</P>
<P>
   VonMayrhauser said he read the opinion to mean that flagging
would be legally unacceptable only if disabled and nondisabled
test-takers got the same results on exams.
</P>
<P>
   But Konecky and other lawyers for the disabled read the opinion
to mean that the test service has a responsibility to see that its
tests are as valid for those with disabilities as for others, and
if both groups can be assessed equally well, flagging should not be
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The case is not expected to go to trial until next year.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas has had one of the nation's worst public health records
for decades. More than a quarter of its citizens have no health
insurance. Its Mexican border is a hotbed of contagion. The state
ranks near the top in the nation in rates of AIDS, diabetes,
tuberculosis and teen-age pregnancy, and near the bottom in
immunizations, mammograms and access to physicians.
</P>
<P>
   But since George W. Bush became governor in 1995, he has not
made health a priority, his aides acknowledge. He has never made a
speech on the subject, his press office says. His administration
opposed a patient's bill of rights in 1995 before grudgingly
accepting one in 1997, and fought unsuccessfully to limit access to
the new federal Children's Health Insurance Program in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Health care is near the top of the election agenda, with Vice
President Al Gore already proposing a vast expansion of insurance
coverage for children. Bush will begin discussing insurance and
other health issues starting on Tuesday with a speech in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, not waiting for his proposals, have already been
attacking Bush for his record in Texas. But politics aside, two
things are clear: Texas' health problems run far deeper than the
identity of any office-holder in Austin, and Bush has not tried to
tackle them, despite a large state budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats point out the Texas's lack of health insurance is
among the most severe in the country. Among Texans ages 19 to 65,
the percentage without coverage rose slightly under Bush and is
higher than in any state but Arizona. The numbers are even worse
among poor children, and hundreds of thousands of them are not
enrolled in Medicaid even though they qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to be interviewed for this article, but the views
expressed by the state's commissioner of health, Dr. William R.
Archer III, cast a light on the Bush administration's approach to
the issue. (Archer, the son of Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the governor
asked him to apply for the commissioner's job; he was formally
chosen by the Board of Health in 1997, and took office after Bush
approved the appointment.)
</P>
<P>
   Almost alone among health experts in Texas, Archer minimizes the
importance of the low rate of health insurance _ a protection that
two-fifths of the state's poor children lack. In an interview,
Archer said that while ``eventually we have to insure everybody,''
he believed the uninsured were still getting care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think insurance is important,'' he said. ``But I don't think
it's the most important thing.'' He said he doubted that coverage
made much real difference to health.
</P>
<P>
   When told of Archer's view, one of the state's leaders in public
health, Dr. Ron Anderson of Parkland Hospital in Dallas, said,
``Then he hasn't read the literature. Shame on him!''
</P>
<P>
   Archer also accused Texas doctors of opposing preventive health
care out of misplaced concern for their own billings. ``If I can
prevent certain diseases upstream, and then there is no need to
treat that disease, then there is nothing to charge against,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And he has stirred disputes with his efforts to move his
department away from the traditional services it has provided to
examine the cultural causes of unhealthy behavior and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said Texas' high teen-age pregnancy rate came
about because the state's Hispanic population lacked ``the belief
in your culture that getting pregnant is a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to go to a Hispanic community and say `Well, we need
to get you into family planning,' they say, `No, I want to be
pregnant,''' he said. ``It doesn't work very well.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a private research
organization, Hispanic teen-agers in Texas had a higher pregnancy
rate than whites or blacks, but the white rate was among the
nation's highest, too.
</P>
<P>
   The health problems of Texas go back far beyond Bush and Archer.
Texas ranks 25th in per-capita income, just ahead of Oregon, but
taxes lightly and provides a modest level of public services. Only
six states collect a smaller percentage of their citizens' income
in state and local taxes than Texas does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flip side of having no income tax is having a very low
level of services,'' said Anne Dunkelberg, a senior policy analyst
at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research
group in Austin representing low-income taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Archer explained why the state tolerated having 598,000 children
eligible for Medicaid, the federal-state health plan for the poor,
but not enrolled in the program: ``The problem is that the
Legislature knows that if we are successful, and we got all those
kids registered, they would not balance their budgets any more.
It's not one person saying `Don't do this.' It's not one agency
saying `Don't do this.' It's sort of `Why would we all rock the
boat at this point?'''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Archer, most prominent health experts in Texas see
the low insurance rates as the state's biggest health problem.
Clair Jordan, executive director of the Texas Nurses Association,
said ``uninsured children end up in the most costly place _ the
emergency room.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Elliott Naishtat, a Democrat who is chairman of the
House Human Services Committee, said, ``The biggest health problem
in Texas is the exorbitant number of people, primarily children,
who have no health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Without insurance, said Jose Camacho, head of the Texas
Association of Community Health centers, children get only sporadic
treatment at best for ear infections, asthma and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance coverage in Texas has been stagnant for several
years. According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the
Uninsured, among Texans 19 to 65 years old, 27.5 percent were
uninsured in 1998, compared to 19.7 percent for the nation. In
1994, before Bush took office, the Texas percentage was 27.8 and
the national figure 18.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among poor children the coverage was much worse. In 1998 39.1
percent of Texans under 18 living at no more than twice the poverty
level lacked insurance, compared to 25.7 percent nationally. In
1994, 36.7 percent of poor children in Texas and 22.8 percent of
poor children nationally were uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for the low rates of insurance, including
migratory labor, a large rural population and many low-wage workers
in nonunion jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the single biggest reason is probably the state's Medicaid
program, which has some of the nation's most severe limits and
complicated eligibility rules and thus makes Texas ``one of the
most difficult states for someone to figure out how to get
enrolled,'' said Diane Rowland, executive vice president of the
Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Garnet Coleman, a Democrat from Houston who is vice
chairman of the House Public Health Committee, contended the state
had created an ``atmosphere of fear'' around applying for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Bertha Rochel, a housewife interviewed at an El Paso clinic,
said some of her neighbors did not seek Medicaid because ``they are
afraid and maybe some of their children are illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some others would find their citizenship applications barred if
they sought government benefits now. Camacho pointed to the Texas
rule that missing an appointment meant a Medicaid applicant had to
start over.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children without health insurance _ now at 1.4
million to 1.5 million _ may drop sharply in the next year when
Texas finally starts enrolling children in the children's health
insurance program, known as CHIP, which was enacted by Congress in
1997. Bush let the question wait until the 1999 legislative
session, and fought to limit the program's coverage to children
with family incomes up to 150 percent of the poverty line, although
the federal law allowed covering children up to 200 percent of the
poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush approach would have excluded 200,000 of the 500,000 who
became eligible when the Legislature insisted on the higher level.
Bush said at a news conference in Sacramento, Calif., on Thursday,
``I signed the 200 percent bill'' and would not say why he pushed
for 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The reason given at the time for Bush's position, legislators
said, was a fear that a big new program would be costly by itself
and turn up a ``spillover'' of many thousands who were already
eligible for Medicaid, which has an income ceiling of 100 percent
of poverty. The federal government reimburses Texas 61.5 cents out
of every dollar spent for Medicaid, and will pay 75 cents on the
dollar for CHIP.
</P>
<P>
   The state has never used the millions of federal dollars made
available by the 1996 welfare law to reach out to potential
Medicaid enrollees, but has a large effort planned for CHIP. Don
Gilbert, the state Commissioner of Health and Human Services, said
he expected to enroll 420,000 children in CHIP and perhaps another
120,000 in Medicaid over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The worst health problems in Texas, with disease rates at Third
World levels, is on the Mexican border. Almost a fourth of the
state's population lives in 43 border counties along the 1,264
miles of the Rio Grande River from El Paso to Brownsville, and as
far from the river as San Antonio, about 125 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Except for San Antonio, it is a poor area. El Paso, Laredo,
McAllen and Brownsville are four of the five poorest cities in the
country. About a third of the population lives below the federal
poverty level. All but two of the counties have a shortage of
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the state comptroller's office, published in 1998,
observed, ``Health conditions in the Texas-Mexico border are among
the worst in the U.S., so distressful that reports on health
conditions suggest a remote country in need of medical
missionaries, not a part of Texas.'' For example, it said, ``cases
of hepatitis A, a gastrointestinal virus borne by contaminated food
and water, are four times as common in the Rio Grande Valley as in
the rest of Texas.'' Tuberculosis, diabetes, and dengue fever are
other high-incidence diseases.
</P>
<P>
   At the border, some improvement has been made in recent years,
but very slowly, said Dr. Laurance N. Nickey, a retired city-county
health director who now serves on the bi-national border health
commission. He said 72,000 people (about a tenth of El Paso's
population) live in unincorporated colonias, or settlements, where
``some of the water is safe to drink,'' and less than half have
safe sewerage.
</P>
<P>
   As primitive as some conditions are on the U.S. side of the
border, they are worse in Mexico. Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.6
million people across from El Paso, is just building its first two
sewage treatment plants. Until now, a 17-mile open trench has been
used for sewage disposal, and it pollutes the groundwater on both
sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said Bush had persuaded the Mexican authorities to put
money into tuberculosis control, a move they had resisted because
the border states in Mexico are not nearly its poorest.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso alone sees about 65 million legal border crossings a
year. ``With this kind of a rate of crossings,'' said Nickey, ``you
don't keep measles on one side of the border and chicken pox on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share the same air. We share the same water. We share the
same pollution. We share the same hazardous waste,'' he said. And
because the border counties are a gateway to the rest of Texas and
the rest of the country, he said, ``it's not just a border issue.
It involves the whole United States.''

SPORTS COLUMN: NEIGHBORS PRAISE YANK FROM YAKIMA 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Out in the Lower Yakima Valley of Washington state, they grow
asparagus and sweet corn and luscious yellow cherries and apples,
particularly apples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody wants us to call ourselves the Big Apple,'' the Rev.
Dave Edler, pastor of the Yakima Foursquare Church and a former
major leaguer, dryly informed a New Yorker Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Yakima is not especially tiny at 55,000, but it is
small enough for people to keep tabs on their own, to see if
success or money has changed them. The word on Mel Stottlemyre is
unanimous. ``Very modest guy, modest life style,'' Judge Michael
Schwab of Superior Court in Yakima County said. ``He went off as
one of us, and he has done us proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre grew up in Mabton _ ``A one-stoplight town, and
probably a blinking light, at that,'' Edler noted _ but he played
for Yakima Community College, and he once owned a sporting goods
store and a baseball camp in town. There is also a baseball field
named after his youngest son, Jason, who died of leukemia in 1981
at the age of 11.
</P>
<P>
   Now Yakima is worrying about its local hero, the Yankees'
pitching coach, who announced on Sunday that he is suffering from
multiple myeloma, cancer of the bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the topic of the morning,'' said Mel Moore,
Stottlemyre's friend and former business partner, who attended
Monday's weekly meeting of the Monday Morning Quarterbacks, who
give money and awards to young athletes in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday Morning Quarterbacks know the heart and soul of the
Yankee from Yakima. ``He's respected not only for what he's
accomplished but for what he stands for,'' Moore said. ``He doesn't
talk a lot, but when he does, people listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore recalled the time, more than 20 years ago, when the Little
League team with Mel Jr. and Todd Stottlemyre, two future major
leaguers, clubbed an opposing team by a score that may have been as
lopsided as 30-0. Some parents felt it was unfair to run up a score
like that, and the father did more than just agree. ``Mel
recommended an all-bat rule,'' Moore recalled. ``The entire roster
had to bat around, even if there were 14 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That local rule kept the two Stottlemyre boys from batting every
inning, but it was the right thing to do, and that is what Mel
Stottlemyre is known for in his hometown _ and in the major
leagues, too.
</P>
<P>
   At the Yankees' delayed home opener Wednesday, Stottlemyre will
be back monitoring the pitchers from the dugout following a day of
treatment for this very serious intruder.
</P>
<P>
   His illness is the latest touch of sadness in a stadium that has
seen too many heroes die young _ from Gehrig to Ruth to Munson to
Howard to Martin to Mantle to Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Stadium has been home for much of Stottlemyre's career.
He pitched there, he coached there, and once he legged out an
inside-the-park grand slam there, one of the most thrilling sights
in baseball, particularly for a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Usually this son of the Northwest let his sinkerball confound
the Yastrzemskis and the Kalines, and let the excitement come from
the flamboyant types like Mantle and Ford and Pepitone.
Pronouncements were not his style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tall and strong and quiet,'' Schwab said Monday. ``Not a
braggart.'' People in Yakima recall how Stottlemyre worked as a
roving instructor for the Seattle Mariners so he could stay close
to Jason. ``That little boy was in spring training with the
Mariners, and everybody would rush to play catch with him,'' said
Edler, the minister, who played parts of four seasons with the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us hurt when Jason died,'' Edler said Monday. ``Now,
for us to know the news, to hear that he's walking into this
adversity, it's hard to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home, the friends are creating a circle of love around the
family. ``We'll definitely get people praying for him,'' Edler
said. ``People will be amazed to see him handle this.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre has talked up the word ``cure'' rather than
``treatment,'' and has helped to advance the cause. He and his
wife, Jean, received the National Recognition Award from the
Leukemia Society of America in 1992, and Todd, now with the Arizona
Diamondbacks, has donated $1 million to leukemia research. Todd
once said that he thinks about Jason every single day. On Sunday,
Todd wanted to leave his club to be with his father, but the father
reminded him that he had an obligation to his team. You do your
job, and you don't make a fuss. That is the man they know at the
Monday Morning Quarterbacks _ Mel Stottlemyre from Mabton in the
Lower Yakima Valley. &QL;

   MIAMI _ Cuban Americans in Miami seemed to concede on Monday
that they have lost the battle to keep Elian Gonzalez in the United
States, as Justice Department officials prepared to present the
child's Miami relatives with a letter instructing them on when and
how he should be handed over to federal officials.
</P>

   Despite a flurry of last-minute appeals by South Florida
politicians, Justice Department officials said the instructions on
the surrender of the boy would probably be presented to the Miami
family sometime on Tuesday, and that Elian would be handed over to
federal officials on Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The letter is the first step in the removal of the boy from his
great-uncle's house in Little Havana and a reunification with his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who awaits Elian at a Cuban
diplomat's house outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are expected to ask family members to take the
boy to a neutral site so that he can be handed over without
incident.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Cuban exile leaders, once defiant, seemed resigned,
although they were not guaranteeing that such a transfer could be
made without a confrontation of some kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fought the battle,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, who has
led the protest outside the home where the boy has lived with his
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and other relatives since being
rescued at sea in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Elian is going to remember is that these people here did
not betray him,'' and worked hard to try and keep him here, Sanchez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo and his counterpart, Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade,
were expected to fly to Washington on Monday to meet with Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Both mayors have said they want the boy to stay, and drew
criticism from around the nation when they said their officers
would not assist federal officials in removing the boy from the
home. On Monday, as Carollo outlined the goal of his meeting with
Reno, it was clear the emphasis had changed
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to ask her to be fair and make sure this process is
done gradually, away from the arms and the strong hands of the
Castro security apparatus,'' Carollo was quoted as telling The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Although Elian's removal from the house is expected to be
completed this week, lawyers for the family filed papers in an
appeal of a federal judge's ruling in March that upheld Reno's
authority in the custody case. The appeal is to be heard at the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   In another last-minute legal proceeding, a Miami-Dade County
circuit judge ordered lawyers for the family to file a brief by
Tuesday that would explain why a state court should hear the case
at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge, Jennifer Bailey, did not offer much hope for a
state court intervention in the case, saying that the lawyers had
presented no evidence that the boy would be in danger if he was
returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also said she did not see how any ruling by her would
overrule the federal court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after refusing for four months to hand the boy over
to federal officials so he could be returned to his father, Lazaro
Gonzalez met with government-appointed psychiatrists and
psychologists to discuss the least traumatic way of handing over
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials, who declined
to comment on what was said in that meeting, agreed to change the
site from Jackson Memorial Hospital near downtown Miami to Mercy
Hospital in Coconut Grove, where Gonzalez's 21-year-old daughter,
Marisleysis Gonzalez, is recovering from stress and exhaustion
related to the custody battle over Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had apparently wanted his daughter, who is close to
Elian, to be at that meeting, but she did not attend. Gonzalez kept
government officials waiting two hours as he insisted on changing
the site of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cardona, an immigration spokeswoman, said it was ``another
instance of the government bending backwards'' to try and make the
removal of Elian as painless as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was not at the meeting, instead visiting Ms. Gonzalez in
her hospital room. She and Lazaro Gonzalez had wanted the
psychiatrists and psychologists to interview the boy, but
government officials refused.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Gonzalez house, when asked by reporters about the
seeming inevitability of the boy's return to his father,
demonstrators talked only about holding yet one more candlelight
vigil, instead of vowing a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will cope,'' Sanchez said.

ACCOUNTABILITY OF RELIGION-BASED PROGRAMS IN DISPUTE IN TEXAS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Allegations of abuse and neglect involving a
Corpus Christi ministry for troubled youth may have delivered a
black eye to Texas faith-based programs that Gov. George W. Bush is
trying to use as a springboard in his Republican bid for president.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm on Monday said
the incidents raised questions about whether there is enough
accountability in Bush's faith-based programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even faith-based organizations must have accountability and
sufficient state oversight to ensure the health, safety and
well-being of the people who are receiving the services,'' Malcolm
said. ``If Bush insists on having a faith-based network with little
oversight and no accountability, we'll see more of these kinds of
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A cornerstone of the faith-based programs Bush pushed through
the Legislature in 1997 was a system of alternative accreditation
for religious-based child-care facilities that believed submitting
to state licensing would endanger their religious distinctiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The first 24-hour child-care facilities to open under such
alternative accreditation last year were the Rebekah Home for Girls
and the Anchor Home for Boys, run by the People's Baptist Church
and Ministries in Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry was founded by the late Rev. Lester Roloff. Amid
allegations of child abuse, Roloff's two homes for troubled youth
were moved from Texas to Missouri in the mid-1980s and then later
closed rather than submit to state licensing.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebekah and Anchor homes reopened in Corpus Christi last
year after receiving alternative certification from the Texas
Association of Christian Child Care Agencies Inc., a private
organization created under the law signed by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Nueces County sheriff's deputies arrested Allen
Smith, the ministries superintendent, and accused him of unlawfully
restraining an 18-year-old man and a 17-year old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services
last year issued a finding of possible abuse or neglect at the
ministries' Rebekah Home for Girls, a ruling that is now being
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones, a spokesman for Bush, said the governor wants the
cases fully investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any allegations of abuse should be taken seriously, and there
should be an aggressive and exhaustive investigation,'' Jones said.
``If any allegations are confirmed, PRS should take whatever steps
are necessary to protect the young people in those facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations being investigated by the Nueces County
Sheriff's Department involve incidents at the Lighthouse Home for
Men, a facility for 18-to 25-year-olds that is not subject to state
licensing. The People's Baptist Church has five homes for troubled
individuals on its 500-acre grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Protective services spokeswoman Marla Sheely said the state
agency is investigating the Lighthouse incident because it involves
an individual who is age 17.
</P>
<P>
   Sheely said the agency also has investigated an allegation of
``abuse or neglect'' at the Rebekah home, but she declined to give
details because the matter is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest incident, the Corpus Christi Caller-Times reported
that the investigation began after Justin Simons, 18, told deputies
a church employee had punched him in the chest and that he had
sprained both ankles when forced to jump over a pit. Simons said he
also had his wrists tied with another resident and then the two
were forced to run through the woods while bound together.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Jones, a lawyer for Smith and the church, told the Houston
Chronicle his client will be exonerated because state law gives
custodial care facility employees the right to use force in certain
circumstances. Jones said the People's Baptist Church facilities
have been treated unfairly in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press is making this look like a bunch of child abusers
out there, and they're not,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. David Blaser, a Dallas minister and head of the
alternative certification agency, also declined to discuss the
specifics, other than to say the state agency found no actual abuse
at the Rebekah home but issued a negative ``finding.'' Blaser said
the Christian child care association is challenging that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't agree with that finding,'' Blaser said. ``We don't
like having that against one of our homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaser said the Corpus Christi facilities founded by Roloff are
the targets of unfair media criticism. He said the homes take the
most troubled youth who often have drug, drinking and emotional
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you deal with children who have problems, you're going to
have problems,'' Blaser said. ``The Roloff homes take the bottom of
the barrel.''

INVESTIGATORS ARRIVE TO SEARCH FOR CAUSE OF FATAL TILT-ROTOR CRASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
And BOB COX 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team of Marine Corps and Navy investigators arrived in Arizona
on Monday at the site of the blackened debris of an MV-22 Osprey
aircraft to try to determine why 19 Marines died during a night
training exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines do not yet know what caused the accident Saturday
night near a civilian airport in Marana, Ariz., as they simulated
an evacuation of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle, head of Marine Corps aviation, told
The Associated Press that he believes ``we'll have a pretty good
idea'' within a week.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was recorded on infrared tape by an F/A-18 fighter
that was overhead, Marine Capt. Aisha Bakkar-Poe said. The crew
chief of a second Osprey saw it nose into the ground, she said,
with no apparent sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Four V-22 tiltrotors, which are built jointly by Bell Helicopter
Textron in Fort Worth and the Boeing Co. in Ridley Township, Pa.,
remain in use by the Marines. But none are being flown as
investigators look for a cause. Bakkar-Poe also said the planes are
on the ground out of respect for other pilots and the families of
those killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a close-knit community of pilots,''
Bakkar-Poe said. ``And the emotional impact that this has had on
the service was significant enough, the commandant does not feel
it's appropriate for them to be flying.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash has again focused unflattering attention on the
safety, merits and costs of the Osprey, which can take off, land
and hover like a helicopter, then shift its propellers forward to
fly longer distances like a plane _ faster than helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the 15 finished Ospreys have crashed since 1991,
killing 26 people. Supporters and opponents said on Monday that the
program is in no real danger. But they said the outlook could
change, depending on whether the crash was the result of a
mechanical or structural failure, or human error in operating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blow, not just because of the loss of life but because
they were pretty close to concluding their tests,'' said R.M.
Rausa, a retired Navy captain with the Association of Naval
Aviation.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the program has gone too far to be curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Marine Col. Terry Dugan, who wrote his thesis at the
Naval War College on the V-22 program, also said he doesn't believe
one mishap would slow the program significantly.
</P>
<P>
   But Dugan, now a commercial pilot who lives near Fort Worth, is
no fan of the program. He said he thinks the Marine Corps has
``mortgaged its future'' on the Osprey and would be better off
investing in less expensive conventional helicopters. He said he
also was troubled before Saturday's accident by the V-22's main
selling point: it's part helicopter, part plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition from forward flight to hover, no matter what
the gee-whiz technology is, is always a difficult transition,''
Dugan said. ``We proved that with the Harrier,'' the ``jump jet''
that also takes off and lands vertically. ``Going to hover from
forward flight is a dangerous time.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Kinneard, a spokesman for Boeing Helicopters in
Pennsylvania, declined to comment on reports that some of the
Marines had concerns about the V-22's readiness and reliability.
But he said the aircraft has undergone redesign and years of
testing to fix problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we've licked all of the major problems and most of the
minor ones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bakkar-Poe said the Marine Corps is confident in the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a proven aircraft,'' she said. ``The capabilities of this
aircraft increase our warfighting capabilities exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and Bell are 50-50 partners on development of the V-22,
which has spun off a similar civilian version. Boeing Helicopters
makes the fuselage and cockpit, and installs avionics and flight
control systems. Bell produces the wings, tail sections,
transmission, rotor systems and installs the engines.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey that crashed was delivered to the Marines in December
and had logged more than 130 hours of flight time. Boeing and Bell
have offered their help in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their airplane,'' Kinneard said. ``They may call on some
of our Boeing and Bell expertise, but that's up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marines had hoped to complete their operational evaluations
by this summer so that full production could begin this fall. The
Marines are scheduled to buy 360 of the aircraft to replace their
30-plus-year-old CH-46 helicopters. The Air Force and the Navy have
said they plan to buy about 50 each.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey program has many supporters in Congress, including
U.S. Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth, who said on Monday that the
V-22 remains a ``vital element'' for the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be watching the investigation closely, but believe the
V-22 still warrants congressional support as a leading-edge troop
transport and deployment aircraft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Retired Navy Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll Jr., vice president of
the Center for Defense Information, called the Osprey program ``a
mess that is at least eight years behind schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   The center is a think tank that advocates cost savings in the
military. He believes Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney was right in
recommending the Pentagon cancel the program in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll considers the cost _ which the Congressional Budget
Office put at $60 million apiece _ as far too much for a craft that
he considers susceptible to enemy fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are up against the wall, wondering what went wrong
this time,'' Carroll said. ``Even if it works like they say, and it
never has, the cost keeps going up and the taxpayers' are not
getting our money's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill de Decker, from the helicopter sales company, Conklin &AMP;
de Decker Associates in Arlington, outside Fort Worth, was more
forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like anything mechanical, it's very complicated and
sometimes these things break,'' he said. ``I hope they get the
problems solved very quickly because, in my opinion, it's a very
fine aircraft.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The V-22 Osprey is a classic case of a military
program that would not be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The crash of an Osprey on Saturday night in Arizona, which
killed 19 Marines, came after years of arguments inside the
Pentagon against building the aircraft, and years of dogged efforts
by Congress to protect the $37 billion program.
</P>
<P>
   The military began flying the first five Ospreys six months ago
despite questions about the safety and cost of the hybrid aircraft,
designed to take off and land like a helicopter but cruise like an
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Defense Department officials tried to cancel the program
11 years ago: too expensive, too experimental, they said. Congress
refused. For four years running, Pentagon officials fought
Congress, trying to stop the Osprey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Navy Secretary Sean O'Keefe told the House Armed
Services Committee that the Pentagon would not spend $790 million
authorized by Congress to build three test aircraft. He said that
``the V-22 cannot be built to meet the requirements specified. It's
an engineering impossibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But Congress again defied the Defense Department, proclaiming
the aircraft to be a potential technological wonder before tests
had validated that claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology was a revolutionary concept that lit the
imagination of lawmakers, and the contractors fueled that fire,''
O'Keefe said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Marine commanders wanted it badly. They had developed no other
alternative to replace the Vietnam-era Chinook helicopter, and they
argued that Marine missions could not be adequately served by even
the newest Army helicopter. Members of Congress said the V-22 had
great commercial potential. And the contracts represented hundreds
of high-tech jobs across the country. Key congressmen, some of them
ex-Marines, dug in their heels.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., the staunchest advocate of the V-22,
Monday dismissed criticism of the aircraft with a barnyard epithet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who would come out now and question the program, they
don't know what they're talking about,'' he said in an interview.
``If there is a technological problem, which I highly doubt, let's
look at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Two test aircraft crashed in the early '90s; one of those
accidents, in 1992, killed seven men. The design of the Osprey has
evolved throughout the decade to reflect lessons learned from those
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Cooper, a long-time military aviation expert at the
Congressional Research Service who retired last month, said two
crashes while testing an aircraft ``do not tell us anything'' about
the aircraft. They are to be expected in testing a new military
system like the Osprey, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It will take weeks or months to determine whether the crash on
Saturday was caused by a design defect, a manufacturing flaw or
human error.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey's mission is to transport 20 to 24 fully armed
Marines, a larger number than can be carried by most military
helicopters, in and out of combat and on rescue missions. Marines
often ferry from ship to shore, and the corps argued for the Osprey
because it could fly farther and faster than a helicopter, but
still land in hot spots without the luxury of a runway.
</P>
<P>
   It has been in development for 18 years; its cost has grown
dramatically over time, partially due to the long fight over moving
the aircraft from the drawing board to the assembly line.
Government agencies outside the Pentagon place the cost today as
high as $60 million apiece. That raises doubts about its commercial
potential.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said Monday that it has not formally grounded the
Osprey, but the Marines will not fly the remaining four until they
understand what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident in the program because of the amount of
testing we've done and the number of hours we've flown it,'' said
Maj. Dave LaPan, a Marine Corps spokesman. ``We've really put this
aircraft through its paces.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Pentagon bowed to Congress and agreed to build
the aircraft, some of its officials, along with auditors from the
General Accounting Office, have warned that the Osprey's testing
was unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the accounting office reported that the aircraft's
major elements ``remain inadequate or untested.''
</P>
<P>
   That year, the Pentagon's inspector general said the aircraft
had gone into development ``without proper authorization'' and
without ``formal review'' _ the result, in part, of ``highly
unusual political factors.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Pentagon said the aircraft's prototypes could not
yet carry passengers or hover over unprepared landing zones. The
Defense Department also criticized the tests the aircraft was put
through as ``extremely artificial.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the GAO concluded that ``after 15 years of development
effort, the V-22 design has not been stabilized.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one ever developed an alternative aircraft. And its
potential, Marine commanders said, was too good to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft's prime contractors, the Boeing Co.'s helicopter
division, in Ridley Park, Pa., and Bell Helicopter Textron of Fort
Worth, Texas, carpeted Congress with data showing that the V-22
would work wonders _ and that parts of it would be built in 40
states.
</P>
<P>
   They persuaded a majority of members of Congress. And the
pressure from Congress to forge ahead never stopped. The supporters
included the most conservative Republicans and the most liberal
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   No one fought harder than Weldon, who represents the
Pennsylvania district that includes Boeing's helicopter division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a coalition that was broad and deep,'' Weldon said
Monday. ``We had the ex-Marines in Congress. We brought in the
retired Marine reserve officers' association. I brought in the
United Auto Workers and the civil aviation people.'' The latter
group promoted the idea that the aircraft had potential commercial
uses.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, the aviation expert, said, ``It does have range and
speed advantages. But is it worth it?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, said O'Keefe, the former Navy Secretary, now a
professor of business and government at Syracuse University. The
futuristic technology may not mesh with its more mundane mission,
he said, ``It's a bus to bring 20 people from ship to shore.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``revolutionary concept'' of the Osprey entranced Congress,
but has proven hard to realize, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was within the realm of the believable,'' O'Keefe said.
``But all the work that was needed to be done, to this day, it
hasn't been accomplished. This was something that required a little
more than pressing the envelope of technology.''

NORTH KOREA OPENS ITS DOOR, JUST A CRACK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For anyone who has ever dreamed of going behind the Iron
Curtain, or at least what is left of it, Communist North Korea now
allows foreigners to visit its magnificent Kumgang Mountains, which
were closed to the outside world at the end of the Korean War 50
years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In February, the first non-Koreans began traveling to Mount
Kumgang National Park, just north of the demilitarized zone that
divides the Korean peninsula into North and South, on sightseeing
boat tours operated by the Hyundai Group, South Korean's biggest
conglomerate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai began offering the tours, at first only to South
Koreans, in late 1998. So far about 150,000 South Koreans and
several hundred foreigners, mainly Americans and Europeans, have
taken the four-day tour, the company said. This correspondent took
it in February. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Y.D. Hong, director of marketing and sales for Hyundai's cruise
division, said the tours provide a rare opportunity to peek inside
North Korea, which remains isolated under the hard-line rule of a
Stalinist government.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And a peek is all they get. Tourists have no freedom to wander
on their own, and little chance of meeting everyday North Koreans.
The trip's highlight is the excursions to the Kumgang Mountains _
Diamond Mountains _ which offer some of the most spectacular
natural scenery in Asia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After decades of isolation, the mountain range, which rises to a
height of 5,377 feet, is unspoiled, with stunning peaks, pristine
ponds and lakes, unusual rock formations and hundreds of cascading
waterfalls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the tour there are two all-day hiking trips, including
the Kuryong waterfalls, the Manmulsang region's craggy mountains
and valleys, and the Haegumgang region, where the Kumgang Mountains
meet the sea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the first hiking trip, tourists are taken to an
indoor-outdoor spa, which costs $12 to visit; after the second day,
they are taken to a riveting performance of the Pyongyang Moranbong
Circus for $25. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every day about 1,000 South Koreans visit the area, which
historically has been a place of reverence and reflection. For many
elderly South Koreans, who fled the Communist North before the
Korean War and still have relatives there, the Mount Kumgang trip
is an emotional homecoming. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best time to visit is between April and November, when there
is no snow on the trails and flowers are in bloom. Reservations
should be made at least a month in advance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because there are no accommodations for foreigners in the area,
the Hyundai cruise ships double as hotels, with restaurants,
discos, game rooms, swimming pools and shopping facilities on
board. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ships have international staffs, consisting mainly of
Filipino, Malaysian and Russian workers, most of whom spoke
English. But some of the South Korean mountain guides had
difficulty explaining things in English. Hong said that by the
start of the spring season, Hyundai plans to have guides who are
fluent in English, Japanese and Chinese. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hong recommends that foreign visitors arrive in Seoul at least
one day ahead of their scheduled trip, which is for four days and
three nights. Hyundai plans to offer shorter trips, for two or
three days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trip begins with a five-hour bus ride from Seoul to the
South Korean port of Tonghae, where tourists board a Hyundai cruise
ship for a 12-hour overnight voyage to the North Korean port of
Changjon, at the foot of the mountains. North Korea is very
protective of its coastline, so the cruise ship must first travel
to international waters and then double back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before going ashore, visitors, under the constant watch of the
North Korean military, are given a list of regulations. It is
forbidden to take photographs of any military installation or
personnel in North Korea. Doing so can result in the confiscation
of film, fines or detention.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While tourists have no contact with local residents, they are
permitted to speak with North Korean officials, especially
environmental guards and inspectors who monitor the mountain paths
_ and were friendly and eager to talk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tour package, which includes lodging, meals and transit,
costs from $700 for a standard room to $1,500 for a luxury suite
during the high season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a limited time, Hong said, Hyundai is offering a 20 percent
discount to non-Koreans who sign up for the tour this year. The
company hopes the tours will interest American veterans of the
Korean War, many of whom will be returning to South Korea this year
to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the conflict. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More information about the tour is available at
www.kumgangsantour.com, or by contacting Hong at hmm(at)hmm.co.kr,
or (82-2) 3706-5023 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Korean time (Korea is 13
hours ahead of Eastern time). Foreign tourists are required to
submit a reservation form, a copy of a valid passport and two color
photos. Payment may be made by credit card. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Hyundai is advertising that the Mount Kumgang tours are
open to all foreigners, Hong said that North Korea has not yet
granted permission for people of Japanese descent or Koreans who
are not residents of South Korea to enter the country. That means
that Japanese-Americans and Korean-Americans are ineligible for the
trip. But Hong said that the company expects to reach an agreement
with North Korea soon that will permit members of the two groups to
visit. &QL;

 MIAMI'S HOLD ON ELIAN APPEARS TO BE LOOSENING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CUBAN-BOY-MIAMI) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Cuban Americans in Miami seemed to concede on Monday
that they have lost the battle to keep Elian Gonzalez in the United
States, as Justice Department officials prepared to present the
child's Miami relatives with a letter instructing them on when and
how he should be handed over to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Joe Carollo of Miami said on Monday that he planned to go
to Washington to ask Attorney General Janet Reno Reno for a 30-day
transition period to minimize the trauma to Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a flurry of last-minute appeals by South Florida
politicians, Justice Department officials said the instructions on
the surrender of the boy would probably be presented to the Miami
family sometime on Tuesday, and that Elian would be handed over to
federal officials on Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The letter is the first step in the removal of the boy from his
great-uncle's house in Little Havana and a reunification with his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who awaits Elian at a Cuban
diplomat's house outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are expected to ask family members to take the
boy to a neutral site so that he can be handed over without
incident.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Cuban exile leaders, once defiant, seemed resigned,
although they were not guaranteeing that such a transfer could be
made without a confrontation of some kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fought the battle,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, who has
led the protest outside the home where the boy has lived with his
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and other relatives since being
rescued at sea in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Elian is going to remember is that these people here did
not betray him,'' and worked hard to try and keep him here, Sanchez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo and his counterpart, Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade,
were expected to fly to Washington on Monday to meet with Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Both mayors have said they want the boy to stay, and drew
criticism from around the nation when they said their officers
would not assist federal officials in removing the boy from the
home. On Monday, as Carollo outlined the goal of his meeting with
Reno, it was clear the emphasis had changed
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to ask her to be fair and make sure this process is
done gradually, away from the arms and the strong hands of the
Castro security apparatus,'' Carollo was quoted as telling The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Although Elian's removal from the house is expected to be
completed this week, lawyers for the family filed papers in an
appeal of a federal judge's ruling in March that upheld Reno's
authority in the custody case. The appeal is to be heard at the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   In another last-minute legal proceeding, a Miami-Dade County
circuit judge ordered lawyers for the family to file a brief by
Tuesday that would explain why a state court should hear the case
at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge, Jennifer Bailey, did not offer much hope for a
state court intervention in the case, saying that the lawyers had
presented no evidence that the boy would be in danger if he was
returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also said she did not see how any ruling by her would
overrule the federal court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after refusing for four months to hand the boy over
to federal officials so he could be returned to his father, Lazaro
Gonzalez met with government-appointed psychiatrists and
psychologists to discuss the least traumatic way of handing over
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials, who declined
to comment on what was said in that meeting, agreed to change the
site from Jackson Memorial Hospital near downtown Miami to Mercy
Hospital in Coconut Grove, where Gonzalez's 21-year-old daughter,
Marisleysis Gonzalez, is recovering from stress and exhaustion
related to the custody battle over Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had apparently wanted his daughter, who is close to
Elian, to be at that meeting, but she did not attend. Gonzalez kept
government officials waiting two hours as he insisted on changing
the site of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cardona, an immigration spokeswoman, said it was ``another
instance of the government bending backwards'' to try and make the
removal of Elian as painless as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was not at the meeting, instead visiting Ms. Gonzalez in
her hospital room. She and Lazaro Gonzalez had wanted the
psychiatrists and psychologists to interview the boy, but
government officials refused.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Gonzalez house, when asked by reporters about the
seeming inevitability of the boy's return to his father,
demonstrators talked only about holding yet one more candlelight
vigil, instead of vowing a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will cope,'' Sanchez said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Clements, a magazine consultant, has a new idea
for a product: a special piece of luggage designed to carry big,
fat magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering how much these things weigh these days, it will be
indispensable,'' he said. ``Who can carry this stuff home?''
</P>
<P>
   Clements was joking, but just barely. After all, the magazines
he was referring to _ In Style, Vogue, Vanity Fair and W _ have all
in the last year blown past their records for size, heft and
length. They are part of a growing breed: the obese magazine,
publications so fat that if they were people, they might spend
their time in a high school auditorium sweating to the oldies with
Richard Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Toss them on a desk, and you'll hear what publishers like to
refer to as ``the thud factor.'' (The louder the thud! thunk! or
boom! the better.) As the economy continues to thrive, some
magazines have become so fat with advertising that the editorial
content is sometimes relegated to the increasingly hard-to-find
nether reaches of the publication.
</P>
<P>
   These magazines are so packed with perfume-scented pages and
dot-com ads _ ranging upward to 1,200 pages a magazine, in extreme
cases _ that some are bigger than the Minneapolis/St. Paul
telephone book (988 pages). Because they are printed on heavy,
glossy paper, they weigh almost as much as a newborn baby. In
Modern Bride's February-March issue, the main editorial feature
section does not begin until page 871; by that point in a
19th-century Russian novel, the heroine most likely would have died
a tragic death chapters ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all magazines are so lucky. Just in the last
month, Time Inc.announced that it would stop publishing Life
magazine in May. Conde Nast, a subsidiary of Advance Publications,
shut down Details in the guise of a four-month publishing hiatus.
Both magazines had slimmed down to a foreboding, anemic flimsiness
_ relative to their fat cousins _ in their final months.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most successful magazines know that the good times will
not last forever. No one expects the advertising dollars to keep
flowing so generously from Internet businesses intent on
establishing their brand.
</P>
<P>
   But for now the magazines that are doing well have never had it
so good. This year, In Style broke its own record with 588 pages in
its April issue, Vanity Fair had a record 472 pages, Vogue's March
issue was 566 pages (not an all-time record, but a record for the
month), and W's March issue was 520 pages (W broke its all-time
record last March with 562 pages). While Bride's might send
affianced women across the country to the chiropractor _ this
spring, the February-March issue made it into the Guinness Book of
World Records as the largest magazine ever produced, at 1,271 pages
_ so might Modern Bride, with 1,062 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Internet business and technology magazines like Red Herring,
Business 2.0 and The Industry Standard are also breaking records.
Fortune broke its record with a 630-page issue that arrived on
newsstands last week. At The Industry Standard, a weekly,
advertising pages have grown by over 450 percent in the last year,
running 1,548 pages in 2000 through the middle of March. That
outpaces every other weekly magazine in the country, including
People, by a significant margin, according to Media Industry
Newsletter, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers bought $1.2 billion in consumer magazine advertising
for February, the last month for which complete figures are
available, according to the Magazine Publishers of America, a trade
association. That represents an increase of 15.4 percent over
February of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Circulation increases help magazines justify higher ad rates,
but the number of readers is often less important than who the
readers are and how badly the advertisers want to reach them.
According to the Publishers Information Bureau, Vogue's advertising
revenue is up by 32 percent for the first two months of 2000,
compared with the same period in 1999, to $21.9 million. But the
magazine's circulation was flat for the year ended Dec. 31, the
last period for which figures are available, according to the Audit
Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   Samir Husni, a professor of media at the University of
Mississippi and a close observer of the magazine industry, said
that magazines have never been so physically huge. ``We used to
have fat issues in the early 1980s, but it was always just the
September issue of Vogue or Elle,'' he said. ``But now any issue of
Fast Co. or Business 2.0 or In Style is as big as those were.''
</P>
<P>
   But with every embarrassment of riches, there is worry.
Publishers lie awake at night worrying that consumers might get
annoyed at the advertising tonnage. Advertisers fret that their ad
might be lost in the vast commercial soup. With a five-pound beast
of a magazine rolling off the printing presses, there can be
problems at the printers, at the bindery, with the trucks, at the
newsstand, and even with the consumer, who some publishers fear
might not want to carry around a magazine that weighs as much as a
cinder block.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Walker, a consultant to the magazine industry, said that
magazines have become fatter for two reasons: First, the economy is
good and advertisers are eager to spread the wealth and, in the
case of new Internet companies, develop brand recognition with
consumers. Second, the most successful magazines are mostly niche
publications, not general-interest magazines, and there has been an
emphasis on targeting audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion and beauty magazines really are vertical,
special-interest publications, as are the dot.com magazines and the
bridal magazines,'' Walker said. ``So there is a significant amount
of endemic advertising. All the venture capital groups and all the
dot.com groups feel it is a requirement that they be in The
Industry Standard. Calvin Klein is required to be in Vogue and In
Style. But who's required to be in Time? No one. And that's why you
won't see a Time magazine this fat.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the general-interest weekly magazines are getting
chubby these days. The Dec. 5, 1999, issue of The New York Times
Magazine was 214 pages long, a record for recent years. Time
magazine's last issue of 1999 was 252 pages. But does anyone really
look at 1,180 pages of ads anyway? If magazine publishers are to be
believed, the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is, does it turn off the reader?'' Walker
asked. ``Absolutely not. To a woman reading a bridal magazine, an
ad for a wedding gown is just as interesting as an editorial page
featuring a wedding gown. What's the difference between a Calvin
Klein ad in Vogue and a Calvin Klein editorial page? Absolutely
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard D. Beckman, the publisher of Vogue, said that the
advertising in the March and September issues, when readers are
thinking about new clothing purchases, ``is the strength of the
book _ readers shop the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ad, the edit, it's all the same,'' said John Balen, the
associate marketing director of Modern Bride.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that readers might be turned off by a magazine's
weight and too many ads prompted Louis Cona, the publisher of In
Style, to survey 5,000 readers of the magazine recently. ``We were
concerned because we thought too much weight might affect the
pass-along readership,'' he said. (A high rate of pass-along
readership _ how many people see each copy _ helps boost
advertising rates.)
</P>
<P>
   Cona said that 66 percent of the respondents said that ``a thick
book makes the issue more valuable.'' And 87 percent said that the
weight of the magazine did not deter them from carrying it to
another place to read.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Yogi Berra's observation _ it's too crowded; nobody goes
there anymore _ holds true for advertisers: some shy away from the
fat magazines. Gene DeWitt, the chief executive of Optimedia
International (U.S.), an advertising services agency in New York,
said that if advertisers could not get highly trafficked pages in a
packed magazine, they might skip that issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the business category, we'll discuss Forbes, Fortune and
Business Week and advertisers will say, `Forget about Business
Week, it's too cluttered,''' he said. (Business Week's ad pages
have risen by 28 percent over last year.) ``And in some issues of
Vogue, if you can't get a good spot, you may say to yourself, `Why
would I want to be in there?' They won't drop the magazine
altogether, but a guaranteed position is required.''
</P>
<P>
   Does more advertising mean more articles? Not necessarily. Most
of the obese magazines stray from the norm for the average ratio of
advertising to editorial content, as measured by the Magazine
Publishers of America. The trade group reported last year that the
average ratio for American consumer magazines was 49.4 percent
advertising to 50.6 editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   Vanity Fair's March issue was 66 percent advertising; the
February/March Bride's _ with a whopping 1,180 pages of ads, said
Nina Lawrence, the publisher of Bride's _ was 93 percent
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Cona of In Style said that he is careful to monitor the ratio of
advertising to editorial pages, keeping it to an average of about
47 percent editorial to about 53 percent advertising. But the April
issue of In Style had 337 pages of advertising and 235 pages of
editorial content, or about 41 percent editorial to 59 percent
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The March issue of Vogue had 177 pages of editorial and 389
pages of advertising, or about 31 percent to 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All that advertising can complicate production. In Style has
grown so big in recent months, there have been delays in getting
the magazine to newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only bind 7,500 copies of In Style per hour, as
opposed to most magazines, where you can bind 11,000 copies per
hour,'' Cona said. ``As you slow down that process, you can have
delivery problems to wholesalers, which gets them out late on the
newsstand, which costs you sales.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of trucking the magazines has also risen. When In Style
was first published in 1995, 20 magazines fit into one bundle. Now,
only five do. Cona has had to hire extra drivers and trucks and has
also had to buy bigger, deeper newsstand racks _ but of course all
the cost is offset by the surging advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, there are worse problems to have in this world,'' Cona
said. ``As long as it thuds, it's good.'' He said that he is always
gratified when Don Logan, the chief executive of Time Inc., which
publishes In Style, calls to see the early copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He drops it on his desk and he listens,'' Cona said. ``And the
louder the thud, the happier he is.''

ANALYSTS SAY MERGER OF BOEING AND BAE UNLIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. and BAE Systems, formerly known as
British Aerospace, will continue to court each other as they look
for joint business opportunities. But they are not headed to the
altar.
</P>
<P>
   That was the assessment Monday of aerospace analysts on both
sides of the Atlantic to a published report in a London paper over
the weekend that the two companies are in talks that could lead to
a $46 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   Such a marriage would dwarf Boeing's $14 billion merger with
McDonnell Douglas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of reasons for these two companies to be
talking,'' said Jon Kutler president of Quarterdeck Investment
Partner, a Los Angeles-based firm that advises aerospace companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two leading companies in both aerospace and defense
so it is natural to have on-going discussions,'' Kutler said.
</P>
<P>
   But he discounted a possible merger, noting that such discussion
between companies are often misinterpreted ``in today's merger
crazy environment.''
</P>
<P>
   BAE Systems has a 20 percent stake in Boeing archrival Airbus
Industrie, which would greatly complicate any merger, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans would not allow Boeing to own 20 percent of
Airbus,'' said Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.
</P>
<P>
   Without citing its sources, the Sunday Telegraph reported that
talks between Boeing and BAE Systems about a merger were
``intense'' earlier this year, though they have cooled slightly.
The paper quoted unnamed executives as saying the discussions are
not dead and will be resumed as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Another UK paper, the Sunday Times, reported in December that
the companies were discussing an ``alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   British Aerospace renamed itself last November after completing
an $11 billion merger with Marconi Electronic Systems to become the
world's second largest defense contractor behind Lockheed Martin.
Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, is third among
defense giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based company already enjoys a long-standing
relationship with BAE Systems, which is a partner in Boeing's
Harrier and T-45 Goshawk military aircraft programs in St. Louis.
BAE Systems does subcontracting work for Boeing on some of its
commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   And the two companies have been working closely in recent months
to strengthen ties in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to gain entry to Korea's $3 billion aerospace market,
Boeing and BAE Systems are expected to make a joint bid next month
for a 30 percent stake in Korean Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   BAE Systems has also worked closely with Boeing to help it win
an important competition that could be announced soon to supply the
UK with transport planes. Boeing is offering its giant C-17.
</P>
<P>
   While they would appear to be a good fit, especially on defense
programs, an outright merger is unlikely, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised to see any formal combination of these
two companies in the near term,'' said Peter Jacobs, who follows
Boeing for Ragen MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' he added, ``I certainly would not discount
the possibility of stepped up efforts between the two companies in
targeting new markets or on their existing partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Boeing already has ``a lot on the table''
with its recently announced $3.75 billion acquisition of the Hughes
satellite-making business.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Aboulafia, senior aviation analyst with the Teal Group,
an aerospace marketing research firm near Washington, D.C.,
described as ``extremely far fetched'' the idea of a merger between
Boeing and BAE Systems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Airbus problem, he said, there is also the
issue of BAE Systems' involvement in the Eurofighter program.
</P>
<P>
   BAE Systems has a 37.5 percent share of the work to produce
Europe's top new fighter, the Typhoon.
</P>
<P>
   The jet will be a direct competitor to Boeing's F-18E/F Super
Hornet once Boeing gets the okay from the U.S. government to sell
its new fighter overseas, Aboulafia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eurofighter is core to BAE's business,'' he said. ``You don't
get any more core than that ... If Boeing were willing to drop (the
Super Hornet), then they could talk about a merger.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy wants more than 500 of the Boeing fighters, which
will soon enter full production with an initial $9 billion order
from the Pentagon for 222 Super Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   Aboulafia said Eurofighter is a much bigger obstacle to any
possible merger between Boeing and BAE Systems than is the British
company's stake in Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for BAE Systems said the report of possible merger
talks with Boeing is ``pure speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said the company does not discuss such
matters.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing did confirm another report that it is talking with
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan about greater cooperation
between the two companies. Alan Mulally, president of Boeing's
commercial airplanes unit, recently met with Mitsubishi's presdient
in Tokyo about cooperation in commercial aircraft and space-related
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi has been a Boeing subcontractor since 1969, and
Boeing is reportedly worried about a move by Airbus to establish
ties with the Japanese manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus has approached Mitsubishi about a possible role in
helping it develop the proposed Airbus A3XX super jumbo. Airbus
already buys some airplane parts from Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   BAE Systems makes wings for Airbus commercial jets. But its role
in Airbus has been diminished by the planned merger of the other
three Airbus partners _ France's Aerospatiale Matra, Germany's
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas.
They will have 80 percent of Airbus after the formation of the new
joint company to be called European Aeronautic Defense and Space

IRAQI DOCTOR, ONCE ON THE CIA PAYROLL, FIGHTS TO STAY IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a strange twist to a complex intelligence case,
a doctor who worked for the CIA in Iraq, but was detained by U.S.
immigration officials after being spirited here for protection, has
decided to fight for political asylum in America rather than being
sent to a neutral third country.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, Dr. Ali Yassin Mohammed Karim, returned to court
Monday at the Terminal Island immigration and detention facility,
where he has been held for three years, to contest government
assertions that he is a national security threat with ties to
Iraqi, Syrian or Iranian intelligence operations.
</P>
<P>
   If he loses the right to stay in the United States, he risks
indefinite detention in American immigration jails, or, more
remotely, deportation back to Iraq, where his lawyers say he would
certainly be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Ali took part in the CIA's failed campaign with the Iraqi
National Congress to undermine Saddam Hussein in the years after
the Persian Gulf war, but was among six held as national security
threats when they were evacuated with thousands of others to the
United States. The six men were ordered deported after a 40-day
trial in 1997 in which the defendants were unable to contest the
government's evidence because it was presented in secret.
</P>
<P>
   But after R. James Woolsey, a former director of central
intelligence, intervened on the Iraqis' behalf and got much of the
evidence declassified, immigration officials offered the men a
settlement that would place them and their families in safe
countries that agreed to accept them. Five of the men agreed and
were released last summer from detention facilities to live with
their families in Lincoln, Neb., until their status is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   But Ali was divorced from his wife after they arrived in the
United States, and she and his children have been granted asylum.
His lawyer, Niels Frenzen, said Ali fears that signing the
settlement would prevent him from ever returning here to see his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the questioning during the morning session Monday
focused on Ali's relationship with his cousin, Aras, whom American
officials maintained in documents had a connection with Iranian
intelligence agents and was, in part, the basis for the
government's decision to hold him as a security threat. One FBI
counterintelligence agent, John Peterson, acknowledged under
cross-examination Monday morning that the relationship may have
meant little.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have nothing to do with him, it may have a great deal
to do with him.'' Peterson subsequently acknowledged that he did
not know for sure, but assumed, that the intelligence regarding
Ali's cousin had been verified.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey is expected in court later this week to take part in the
representation of Ali. Also, a retired senior CIA case officer,
Warren Marik, who was stationed in Iraq and acted as the liaison
between the CIA and the Iraqi National Congress resistance group,
is expected to testify on Ali's behalf later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Ali's mother, Zakia Hakki, who now lives in Virginia and was
present at the hearing Monday morning, said her son is the subject
of a death warrant by the presidential palace in Iraq and that
American officials made a ``grave mistake'' in suspecting him as a
double agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't prepare for this,'' Hakki said. ``When you try to
accuse him of being a threat, the highest crime, you have to give
him a chance to defend himself.''

SLAYING OF MEXICAN JOURNALIST BELIEVED TO BE A REPRISAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARLINGEN, Texas _ In the rough-and-tumble world of Mexican
journalism, police reporter Pablo Pineda Gausin had one of the
toughest jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Armed only with a notebook and a camera, the 37-year-old Pineda
followed Mexican police in this large border city documenting the
world of killers, drug traffickers, and immigrant smugglers.
Between crime scenes, he slept on a couch in the lobby of state
police headquarters in Matamoros.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, some of his colleagues said his regular exposes of
local crime bosses may have cost the reporter his life. Pineda was
the victim of an execution-style slaying Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter's body was ferried across the Rio Grande in a small
raft at 2:45 a.m. Sunday and dumped on Texas soil near Los Indios.
Pineda's hands were tied behind his back and his head wrapped in
plastic bag. But the cause of death was a single, large-caliber
bullet wound to the back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a tough reporter,'' said Angeles Negrete, a reporter
for El Bravo, Matamoros' largest daily newspaper. ``He was always
doing stories about drugs, about smuggling, about corruption. He
made some people mad at him, including the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Pineda, who narrowly escaped an attempt on his life at his home
last October, worked full-time as police reporter for La Opinion,
the second largest Matamoros daily. He worked for the section of
the paper called ``La Nota Roja,'' or the Red Report, a reference
to its graphic crime coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio said the killers probably
dumped Pineda's body on the U.S. side of the border to stymie the
investigation. Mexican police have no authority to cross the river,
he said. A similar tactic was used last year when his deputies
found the bodies of two kidnapped Mexican police officials dumped
on a brushy riverbank, Lucio said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities came close to solving the case quickly Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Border Patrol agents saw two men cross the river and dump
what they thought was narcotics or other contraband on the
riverbank, Lucio said. After waiting for several hours to see if
anyone came to pick up the package, the Border Patrol officers
moved in and discovered Pineda's body wrapped in a sleeping bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there, they have very powerful people and sometimes
(reporters) write something that is too harsh, too direct and to
the point, and probably some people take action on what is
written,'' Lucio said.
</P>
<P>
   His department is cooperating with Tamaulipas state police in
Matamoros, Lucio said. Deputies made arrangements Monday to turn
over crime scene photographs and other information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to hit it, see what facts we can get from people
and work it on the Mexican side where he supposedly was killed,''
said state police supervisor Eduardo Esparza.
</P>
<P>
   Robbery was not a motive, Esparza said. Pineda's bracelet, gold
chains, rings and wallet were untouched. The slaying was more
likely a reprisal, police believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of problems with coyotes (immigrant smugglers),
that's what you hear in Matamoros,'' Esparza said.
</P>
<P>
   Other journalists said there were rumors that Pineda was
involved in smuggling or protecting a group of smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was discussed if he really was a good journalist or if he
was using journalism for other reasons,'' said Hector Miguel
Chavez, who runs a private news agency in Matamoros. ``That's why
we want the authorities to clear this up.''

IT'S TGIF WHEN USC'S CURRIER'S ON THE MOUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are Friday guys, Saturday guys and Sunday
guys. That's how a college baseball coach refers to his starting
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Friday guy is the ace, he starts a weekend series against
the other team's top pitcher. Saturday, the solid No. 2, a starter
who can decide a series. Sunday is potluck.
</P>
<P>
   That's what USC got from Rik Currier last year. Sometimes he was
brilliant, others just plain bad and mostly he was mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Not this year. Currier is delivering for the Trojans. He pitched
a complete game and struck out 12 in USC's 5-1 win over UCLA on
Friday, improving to 8-2. Currier's performance is more impressive
considering the heavy-hitting Bruins scored 23 runs in the series'
next two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Currier) is on a mission to win every Pac-10 start,'' USC
pitching coach John Savage said. ``(This season) he's been a
different guy. When he's going good, he's legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Currier has a 3.99 ERA and opponents are batting only .242
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Currier usually starts Saturdays this year. But he moved up one
day for the UCLA series because Mark Prior, a transfer from
Vanderbilt, has been sick.
</P>
<P>
   After holding the Bruins to five hits, and retiring 15 of 16 at
one point, Savage gave Currier the ultimate compliment:
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched like a Friday guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Currier's career at USC hasn't been consistent. He was a
freshman All-American in the Trojans' national championship season
in 1998 going 6-1 with 100 strikeouts in 71 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped off the map in '99 behind transfers Barry Zito and
Justin Lehr. Currier was 5-7 with a 6.38 ERA, and he gave up 101
hits in 79 innings. This year Currier is giving up less than a hit
per inning - 64 in 67 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I was pressing too hard,'' Currier said. ``I was
letting (things) get to me. It was a downward spiral.... The
pressure that I had was what I put on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Currier, a 5-foot-10 right-hander from Mission Viejo, went to
the Cape Cod League last summer and was selected the league's
pitcher of the year.
</P>
<P>
   His confidence restored, Currier has been one of the reasons the
Trojans (23-13, 6-3) are in the race for the Pac-10 title.
</P>
<P>
   Even as USC advanced to the second round of the NCAA playoffs
last season, Currier considered it a bittersweet experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be pitching in the big games. It was tough to see
those other guys do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's one of those guys. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising: UCLA leads the Pac-10 after taking two of three
against USC. The Bruins were picked to finish second in the
coaches' preseason poll.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches pegged the Trojans third, a vote of respect for the
talent recruited by the Trojans coaches. USC lost almost every
position player and its top two starters from last season. Top
recruit Pat Manning, a third-round draft choice, signed with the
Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   USC's lineup Friday against UCLA included center fielder Josh
Self (.206 average in 34 at-bats last year), a freshman (Anthony
Lunetta) at second base, Josh Persell (14 starts in '99) at DH,
first baseman Bill Peavey (three ABs in two prior seasons) and left
fielder Brian Barre (25 ABs in '99).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just youth, it's inexperience,'' Gillespie said.
``We've got some older guys that didn't play much.... We probably
have played above, at least record-wise, what we could have
predicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Intensity: The weekend was perfect in Malibu, as usual. A bright
sun, a blue ocean and a white beach.
</P>
<P>
   But the conditions inside Pepperdine's Eddy D. Field Stadium
were not idyllic. The Loyola Marymount players don't really like
Pepperdine and the feeling is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Even the fans don't get along. When Waves coach Frank Sanchez
delayed Sunday's game for 10 minutes, arguing a call in the fifth,
the LMU fans jeered. The Pepperdine fans hollered at the Lions
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teams are so closely matched right now,'' LMU coach Frank
Cruz said after the Lions won 4-3 to take the series, two games to
one. ``I think (the rivalry) is overlooked, but it's not overlooked
by the 60 people that are going at each other in the dugouts and
their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Reborn: LMU right-hander Mike Schultz, considered the 20th-best
major-league prospect in college by one national publication, hopes
his performance Sunday - complete game, nine strikeouts - portends
the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz's ERA dropped from 7.22 to 6.51.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been a matter of confidence,'' said Schultz, who
went to Reseda's Cleveland High. ``(This season) I started throwing
harder and I tried to overpower people instead of hitting my
spots.''

   NEW YORK _ Divas do what they want to do, when they want to do
it. Divas can't resist an adoring audience. Divas have big hair and
flashy dresses. Divas live in a realm where show-business cliches
become a secular creed. Divas profess love while wreaking havoc.
Divas are beloved troupers and glamorous monsters.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Ross lived up to her billing as the ultimate diva at the
taping on Sunday night for VH1's ``Divas 2000,'' which is to be
shown Tuesday night at 9. It was VH1's third annual Divas concert,
but the first to be taped rather than carried live. If costume
changes, band setups and diva whims had extended much longer, it
would have been ``Divas 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   The concert at the Theater at Madison Square Garden was a
tribute to Ross, recognizing her world-beating success with the
Supremes in the 1960s and her career since 1970 as a solo singer
and a movie actress. The plan was straightforward: Mariah Carey,
Faith Hill and Donna Summer each sang their own songs and one of
Ross' hits, with cameos from RuPaul (who claimed Ross' ``I'm Coming
Out'' as a gay anthem) and Destiny's Child.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who's now trying to be a blond Shania Twain, paid
inadvertent homage to Ross' old vocal timing by belting every
phrase of ``Love Child'' right on the beat, flattening it. Summer
was more soulful, bringing a gospel richness to ``Reflections.''
Carey, in her own songs, overdid her swoops and slides, circling
around melody notes like a small plane lost in the fog.
</P>
<P>
   Once Ross stepped onstage, the show was dictated, diva style, by
her needs and impulses. She made her entrance in a brightly
patterned, fringe-trimmed dress, gushing, ``Where I'm at in my life
is about giving you my love.'' VH1 couldn't have planned for a
better way of inciting diva temperament than to start Ross'
performance with sound problems; a VH1 spokeswoman said Ross
insisted on using her own equipment, which was incompatible with
VH1's setup.
</P>
<P>
   Ross sang ``Touch Me in the Morning'' and ``Endless Love''
punctuated by loud bursts of static. She tried to maintain
equanimity, Hollywood style. ``It's just about playing and enjoying
your process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   From the prompter she delivered a list of thank yous, including
``Mary and Cindy, I love you.'' (Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong,
surviving members of the 1960s Supremes, would not accept offers to
join her in this summer's Supremes reunion tour.) ``I don't hear
the sound well enough with this microphone,'' she finally
announced, her voice sharpening. ``This doesn't please me.''
</P>
<P>
   With a new microphone she suddenly decided to sing ``The Best
Years of My Life,'' which she called ``a testimonial song for my
career,'' while strolling through the aisles accepting hugs from
audience members. Second takes were necessary; as she cooed ``Touch
Me in the Morning'' to her band's lounge-flavored backup, she
swayed her hips and instructed the director, Steve Binder to ``get
the fringe.'' Still, she brought a nearly weightless delicacy and
tenderness to the songs.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the reconstituted Supremes, with Scherrie Payne and
Lynda Laurence, who sang with the group in the 1970s after Ross
left. Their choreography needs a lot of work; Payne gestured up a
storm, even after Ross whispered something to her in mid-song.
After two Supremes songs Ross lingered onstage to sing an impromptu
solo reprise of ``Love Is Like an Itching in My Heart.'' Mariah
Carey had better Supremes moves when she and Ross, both in short,
shiny minidresses, shared ``Baby Love'' and ``Stop! in the Name of
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   After all the women and RuPaul gathered for the finale, ``Ain't
No Mountain High Enough,'' Ross stayed to bask in the applause,
then chose to do an encore. ``Where's my band?'' she asked. ``My
band never leaves the stage before I leave the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Errant musicians returned. Binder asked Ross if Destiny's Child
could redo its segment, but Ross ruled, ``No, let me do this
first.'' After calling for requests, she ignored her entire catalog
to sing a diva classic: Gloria Gaynor's ``I Will Survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The neo-Supremes returned to shrill the chorus while the band
vamped and Ross cued solos; a boy came onstage to revive Michael
Jackson's old moonwalk moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time passes quickly,'' Ross philosophized after the final
notes. ``Open your eyes, look and see where you are and enjoy
life.'' Destiny's Child could wait.
</P>
<P>
   How much of the taping will appear in the television version of
``Divas 2000'' is up to VH1. It can joke about divas, or it can
show one unbridled.

   FICTION
</P>
<P>
   JHUMPA LAHIRI
</P>
<P>
   ``Interpreter of Maladies''
</P>
<P>
   This collection of stories about the lives of people in North
America and India is the first book by Jhumpa Lahiri. Born in
London, she grew up in Rhode Island and lives in New York City. She
is a graduate of Barnard College and Boston University. Many of the
characters in her stories are Indian immigrants in the United
States confronting a cultural displacement.
</P>
<P>
   The book was published last June in a trade paperback edition.
In her review in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote:
``Lahiri chronicles her characters' lives with both objectivity and
compassion while charting the emotional temperature of their lives
with tactile precision. She is a writer of uncommon elegance and
poise, and with `Interpreter of Maladies,' she has made a
precocious debut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The family looked Indian but dressed as foreigners did, the
children in stiff, brightly colored clothing and caps with
translucent visors. Mr. Kaspasi was accustomed to foreign tourists:
he was assigned to them regularly because he could speak English.
Yesterday he had driven an elderly couple from Scotland, both with
spotted faces and fluffy white hair so trim it exposed their
sunburnt scalps.''

   GENERAL NONFICTION
</P>
<P>
   JOHN W. DOWER
</P>
<P>
   ``Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II''
</P>
<P>
   John W. Dower subjects the nearly seven-year American occupation
of Japan after World War II to a searching, myth-breaking
examination. Popularly known as a huge success, the occupation, in
Dower's portrait, was a complex and wrenching adjustment by the
Japanese to overwhelming American power. Dower, a historian at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, draws out the occupation's
deep effects on Japanese society, treating topics like the
pervasiveness of prostitution, the postwar role of Emperor Hirohito
and the emergence of a brand of state capitalism with a close
relationship between government and business.

<P>
   HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   DAVID M. KENNEDY
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War,
1929-45''
</P>
<P>
   In his one-volume work on the era of President Franklin D.
Roosevelt, part of the Oxford History of the United States series,
David M. Kennedy portrays President Herbert Hoover as a reflective
humanitarian ``overwhelmed by events,'' finds order in the chaos of
New Deal policies, and suggests that Roosevelt bent the law so far
to get aid to France and England that he almost courted
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But the high drama of the book is watching a nation,
straitjacketed by an isolationist Congress, enter the war. A native
of Seattle, Kennedy, the Donald J. McLachlan professor of history
at Stanford University, is also the author of ``Birth Control in
America: The Career of Margaret Sanger'' (1970), which won the
Bancroft Prize, and ``Over Here: The First World War and American
Society'' (1980), which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.

   POETRY
</P>
<P>
   C.K. WILLIAMS
</P>
<P>
   ``Repair''
</P>
<P>
   C.K. Williams, a New Jersey native, lives part of the year in
Paris and teaches at Princeton University. Known for his long,
Whitmanesque sentences and his documentarylike style, he can be
ruthless, even cruel, in his pitiless contemplation of the world
around him. The subjects of his early work were politics, the
Vietnam War, the horrors of the nuclear age. But in recent years,
his poems have become more personal and introspective. In the poem
``Archetypes,'' Williams writes about a sleeping woman who stirs in
her dreams and rises up, like an animal, to her hands and knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your fingers began to move then, in brief, irregular tensions
and releasings;
</P>
<P>
   it felt like your hand was trying to hold some feathery,
fleeting creature,
</P>
<P>
   then you suddenly, fiercely, jerked it away, rose to your hands
and knees,
</P>
<P>
   and stayed there, palms flat on the bed, hair tangled down over
your face,
</P>
<P>
   until with a coarse sigh almost like a snarl you abruptly let
yourself fall
</P>
<P>
   and lay still, your hands drawn tightly to your chest, your head
turned away,
</P>
<P>
   forbidden to me, I thought, by whatever had raised you to that
defiant crouch.''

   BIOGRAPHY
</P>
<P>
   STACY SCHIFF
</P>
<P>
   ``Vera (Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov)''
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of this portrait of a 52-year marriage is not just
in providing entree to the wife's famous husband. She fascinates in
her own right: first, as a girl reciting Nabokov by heart when, in
1923, she makes her first approach to the aristocratic,
Cambridge-educated writer, already well known among Russian
expatriates in Berlin; ever thereafter until Nabokov's death in
1977 as the provider of the comforts he needed, as he told her,
``for the sake of not thinking about them.'' Stacy Schiff is the
author of ``Saint-Exupery,'' a finalist for the 1995 Pulitzer Prize
in biography.
</P>
<P>
   DRAMA
</P>
<P>
   DONALD MARGULIES
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinner With Friends''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Margulies, 45, a veteran playwright known for comic
excisions of troubled families, won for a gentle, straightforward
play that shuns the arch and sometimes farcical vision of previous
works like ``The Loman Family Picnic'' and ``What's Wrong With This
Picture?'' He lives in New Haven, Conn., where he teaches
playwriting at the Yale School of Drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinner With Friends'' is about four friends, two baby-boom
marriages, one of which is coming apart. In various settings _ a
well-appointed kitchen, a couple's bedroom, a suburban back porch,
an upscale bar _ the play recreates a world meant to give pangs of
recognition to affluent midlife theatergoers. The play opened
Off-Broadway in November and has become a surprise hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What initially seems a rather conventional glimpse at the
perils of breaking up,'' Peter Marks wrote in his review in The New
York Times, ``becomes an original examination of the terrors of
staying together.''

   MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   LEWIS SPRATLAN
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is a Dream, Opera in Three Acts: Act II, Concert
Version''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Spratlan, 59, is a composer who was born in Miami and has
been a professor of composition at Amherst College since 1970. He
based this opera on a 17th-century Spanish play by Pedro Calderon,
``La Vida Es Sueno.'' Using an English libretto by James Maraniss,
Spratlan created a theatrical world in which the characters were
given distinct musical thumb prints that were meant to embody their
personalities, and in which the dissonances and angularities of
contemporary styles were linked with traditional dance, march and
madrigal forms. Spratlan completed the work in 1978, but revised
its second act for concert use. The concert version was given its
world premiere by the Dinosaur Annex, conducted by J. David Jackson
in Boston on Jan. 28.

   PUBLIC SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   THE WASHINGTON POST
</P>
<P>
   The Post won the gold medal for public service, its second in a
row, with a two-part series describing both the abuse of those
living in the District of Columbia's group homes for the mentally
retarded and how their ill treatment often resulted in death. The
city government has pledged to reform the system.
</P>
<P>
   The writer, Katherine Boo, 35, a native of Washington, spent 13
months reporting after a source on another article about welfare
revisions took her into a group home where retarded residents were
sitting in total darkness with roaches scuttling underfoot. Boo
found that the people who died in those circumstances were often
buried in unmarked graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the prize is a small marker that the Pulitzer
board has put down on these unmarked graves,'' she said Monday,
``and it says that the people who died here and who suffered here
mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING
</P>
<P>
   THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
</P>
<P>
   The AP won for painstakingly documenting a decades-old cover-up
of atrocities by the U.S. military in the first weeks of the Korean
War. Three reporters _ Charles J. Hanley, Martha Mendoza and
Sang-Hun Choe _ aided by Randy Herschaft, a researcher, disclosed
for the first time how American soldiers machine-gunned hundreds of
civilians under a bridge at No Gun Ri. The work has led to an
investigation by the Army. ``We're proud of the No Gun Ri
reporting,'' the four said in a statement. ``But our celebration is
tempered by the nature of what we confirmed.''

   The Village Voice
</P>
<P>
   Mark Schoofs said his editors did not blink when he proposed
what was a costly assignment for an alternative weekly: spending
six months documenting the AIDS catastrophe in sub-Saharan Africa.
During his travels, Schoofs, 37, visited rural villages where no
journalist had ever been and contracted a drug-resistant form of
malaria that put him in the hospital. In a 28,000-word series, he
described the struggles of elderly people forced to care for
orphaned grandchildren and the often-heroic efforts of impoverished
villagers to provide for the sick. He said he hoped the series
would bring about more aid to the region. ``This country can make a
huge difference,'' he said.

   NATIONAL REPORTING
</P>
<P>
   STAFF OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
</P>
<P>
   The Journal series examined the ways the U.S. military spent
billions of dollars after the Cold War ended. In what the newspaper
called an unusual collaboration, the articles were produced by
Thomas E. Ricks, its Pentagon correspondent, and five business
reporters in bureaus around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal found and explained problems varying from the
Defense Department's reluctance to embrace promising technology to
the Navy's use of skilled technicians to count the number of
sailors choosing pork chops for dinner.

<P>
   St. Paul Pioneer Press
</P>
<P>
   George Dohrmann, 27, doggedly pursued academic cheating by the
University of Minnesota basketball team and showed that school
officials were doing players' course work. His reporting exposed
one of the broadest cases of academic fraud in collegiate history _
enraging many fans _ and led to the buyout of the head coach and
dismissal of four other officials.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Russ Archambault, a former player, who recounted how
one athletic department employee tutored him: ``I sat down and she
just started typing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dohrmann said the key to breaking the story was winning the
confidence of a retired athletic department employee who gave him
records. ``I had to convince her that what she did was wrong,'' he
said.

   STAFF OF THE DENVER POST
</P>
<P>
   From the first hour of the killings at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., last April, a staff of 54 reporters and eight
photographers reported relentlessly on the massacre, publishing
more than two dozen stories within 12 hours of the first shot.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the prize was bittersweet for the staff, many of whom
lived in Littleton, said Frank Scandale, The Post's assistant
managing editor for news, who supervised the Columbine coverage.
``You had covered their sporting events, their City Council, their
baton-twirling championships,'' Scandale said. ``And then, to see
these kids on the ground, bloodied and tortured, broke down a lot
of people.''

   The Great Falls Tribune
</P>
<P>
   Eric Newhouse, 55, the newspaper's projects editor, won for a
yearlong series of monthly articles on the social and economic
costs of alcoholism in Montana. The project, which included regular
visits with a chronic alcoholic, represented, he said, a
``tremendous commitment'' for a paper with a circulation of 34,000
and a full-time staff of 38.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-year veteran of The Associated Press, Newhouse was a
bureau chief in Charleston, W.Va., when he found himself ``an
administrator, a paper pusher too far divorced from the news I
loved.'' He left for The Great Falls Tribune in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about me,'' he said by telephone in the midst of a
newsroom celebration. ``It's about a small newspaper willing to
devote its resources to such a huge problem. We're very much a
community paper, and people trust us. So many folks were willing to
talk to us with candor and honesty about their problem. I'm in awe
of the folks I've dealt with who entrusted so much to us.''

   ``When Brassai took his camera out into the Paris night, he was
reveling in the humanity _ not the alienation _ of the whores,
thieves and gay demimonde he photographed: the naked brothel staff
with dimpled bodies whose shapes remind you of Babe Ruth, the
lurking darkness beneath bridges, the cafe girl with spit curls and
a bad tooth lolling heavy-lidded between two sailors, the
quarreling lovers in their adamance and sulk, the two thugs of the
sort who robbed and beat Brassai during his nighttime
investigations.''

</P>
<P>
   Many of his columns examined the impeachment battle and the
harsh light it focused on Washington and on the reporters who
covered it. In one column, Gigot concluded: ``Only here could could
a man who lies under oath be equated with someone who tries to
defend the value of that oath. The point is never, `What's right?'
but rather, `Who won?' ''

   John C. Bersia, 43, won for editorials about the lending
practices of payday advance and car-title loan companies. ``There
was evolving a double standard,'' he said Monday, ``one for people
who were poor or in desperate financial circumstances and were
forced to borrow at triple-digit rates, and the other for people in
the mainstream, borrowing at lower rates.'' When the state Senate
rejected a bill to regulate car-title companies, which typically
lend a customer about 15 percent of the value of an auto, Bersia
wrote editorials urging Florida's 67 counties to approve similar
legislation. So far, 36 counties have limited the interest charged
by car-title lenders to 30 percent a year or less; 11 other
counties are considering similar laws.

HERTA WILL RACE AT LONG BEACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ CART FedEx Series driver Bryan Herta will compete
for Walker Racing in this weekend's Grand Prix of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Valencia driver is still under contract with Forsythe
Championship Racing, but tangles with CART officials over franchise
restrictions have kept Herta out of the first two events of the
CART FedEx Series.
</P>
<P>
   Herta, who was signed by Gerald Forsythe to drive a Honda/Swift
Champ car sponsored by Panasonic, missed the Miami Grand Prix and
the Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix in Nazareth, Pa. The Nazareth race
was snowed out.
</P>
<P>
   When Derrick Walker, owner of the Walker Racing team, lost his
driver, Shinji Nakano, to injury during a recent practice session,
Walker asked Herta to replace the Japanese-born driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick called me, and he knew I was under contract, but he
asked me to fill in for the next couple of races,'' Herta said.
``Gerry thought it would give me the opportunity to go out and do
some racing. Walker is an excellent team and they use a Honda
engine. So for me, it meets my criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Herta is scheduled to race at Long Beach and
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Nakano is supposed to be be back for the
Firestone Firehawk 500 at Twin Ring Motegi in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Herta said he hopes his Forsythe Championship Racing
team will be allowed to compete in Motegi as well. In addition to
not being allowed to compete because the CART Board of Directors
decided in March that Forsythe could not own three franchises,
Herta lost his chassis as Swift decided to end its contract with
Herta's team. Forsythe also owns the Player's team with Patrick
Carpentier and Alex Tagliani as drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little bit behind the eight-ball right now,'' Herta
said. ``It's a day-to-day thing. I'm just waiting to hear from
Gerry and find out what he wants to do. All the pieces are in
place, but all I can do now is focus on the next two races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, I'd like to get a couple of Reynards and catch up
with everyone at Motegi.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakano was the top-finishing rookie and eighth overall finisher
in the season opener at Miami.

DETROIT HOPES NEW BALLPARK IS STAR PLAYER IN CITY'S REDEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 16th graf, ``This city ..., to delete reference to Jesus
Christ from quote. Also being filed in `s' category.) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Few major cities have talked more about or waited
longer for a visible symbol of resurrection than this one, the
nation's poorest.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the patience will be rewarded on Tuesday, with the
inaugural game at Comerica Park, the new $300 million home of the
Detroit Tigers baseball team and the showpiece of a burgeoning
entertainment district in downtown Detroit. The stadium was built
with city, county, state and private money, and was named for its
corporate sponsor, Comerica Bank in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders are convinced that the ornate open-air stadium,
with its synchronized water fountains and 50-foot-high Ferris
wheel, will drive investment _ not to mention thousands of visitors
_ back downtown, just as Jacobs Field and Camden Yards transformed
Cleveland and Baltimore into banner cities for urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of banners, Tigers officials are quietly picking out
spots to display a World Series banner, should the
down-on-their-luck Tigers bring home the championship, a feat this
99-year-old franchise has not accomplish since 1984. And the way
the team is limping along _ at 1-5, the Tigers have the worst
record in baseball _ fans will probably wait a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've endured a lot of rhetoric over the years,'' said Denise
Illitch, the daughter of Tigers owner Mike Illitch. ``But this
ballpark is real. It's proof things are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Illitch is president of Olympia Development, which is
handling projects surrounding Comerica Park. The Illitch family
also owns the Detroit Red Wings hockey team, which plays at Joe
Louis Arena on the city's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Change is whirling all around the ballpark. Later this week,
construction will begin on an $800 million office complex several
blocks south that will become the headquarters of the Compuware
Corp., which makes software for managing corporate networks. The
company is moving from Farmington Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Just east of the stadium, construction crews are excavating the
site of Ford Field, a brick-and-glass stadium with a dome, also
costing about $300 million, that will sit alongside Comerica Park
and bring the Detroit Lions football team back to the city for the
first time in 26 years. The Lions, who now play in the Silverdome
in suburban Pontiac, plan to open Ford Field in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 3 million people expected to visit Comerica Park
this season will not have to worry about parking or traffic.
They'll walk to the 40,000-seat ballpark. Forty-seven townhouses,
with price tags of $140,000 to $250,000 are being built across the
street, on land that for years had been used by prostitutes and
drug users
</P>
<P>
   Signs advertising loft space pop up daily in the windows of
deserted office buildings nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But most surprising is the nightlife that has crept back, now
that two of the three voter-approved casinos have opened temporary
sites on the fringe of downtown. On most evenings the parking lots
at the MGM Grand and the Motorcity Casino resemble those of
suburban shopping malls. Eventually the casinos will build near the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one here, not even the ever-jubilant Mayor Dennis
Archer, is ready to proclaim Detroit completely reborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not where we want to be,'' Archer said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Huge swaths of the city are dominated by weed-choked lots and
abandoned houses. Some basic services like street lighting and bus
service are still unreliable. That is why many Detroit residents
say they are reluctant to believe that the city's renaissance will
ever extend beyond downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd that we're spending hundreds of millions of
dollars on a new ballpark when we can't keep our libraries open
regular hours and our kids don't even have safe playgrounds,'' said
Frank Rashid, a lifelong resident and founder of the Tiger Stadium
Fan Club, which pleaded with city officials to revitalize Tiger
Stadium. The famed ballpark sits empty about a mile from Comerica
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is fixated on shortcuts to revitalization,'' Rashid
said, relaying on huge projects ``that do nothing but deliver false
promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban planning and economic experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is no evidence that building a new sports stadium
resurrects a downtown or a city,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, an
economics professor at Smith College. ``In cities that are
investing in several downtown projects all at once, there is
additional activity, but it's mostly from the transfer of income
and employment from surrounding communities into the downtown area.
You rarely see a great spread effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mayor contended that Comerica Park was crucial to
Detroit's comeback, if for no other reason than as an morale boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comerica Park will help restore the excitement of urban living
that has been missing far too long from downtown Detroit,'' Archer
said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Comerica Park was designed to dazzle. Life-size
stone tigers and baseball bats guard the entrances. Inside the
ballpark, children can ride a Ferris wheel with seats shaped like
baseballs or a carousel featuring 30 handpainted tigers. The
low-rise outfield stands are expected to be another attraction,
with their postcard view of the city's skyline. Along the wall in
left-center field, huge stainless steel statues of Hall of Fame
players like Hank Greenberg, Ty Cobb and Charlie Gehringer will
keep watch. And the 10-story-tall scoreboard is the largest in
baseball, the Tiger organization says.
</P>
<P>
   As it is with most things, Comerica Park's grandeur comes at a
price. Now that the team offers luxury seats, the price of an
average home game ticket has doubled to $24.83, the fourth highest
in baseball, according to Team Marketing Report.
</P>
<P>
   But even that has done little to spoil this city's excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit has lost so much and had to wait so long for something
to be proud of,'' said 63-year-old Bernard Battistelli, a longtime
Tiger fan, who typically attends 10 to 15 home games a year. ``I'd
rather pay a little extra than sit around another 10 years waiting
for a rebirth.''

HATRED OF CASTRO FEEDS OUTRAGE AMONG EXILES 
</HEADLINE>
 (With CUBAN-BOY) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ ``Libertad. Libertad. Libertad.''
</P>
<P>
   The word lords over the house where Elian Gonzalez is staying in
Little Havana. It is scribbled on posters, scrawled on T-shirts,
shouted over megaphones and whispered in prayers. It is the first
word that rolls off people's tongues as they try to answer the
questions so many outside the Cuban community have been asking: Why
so much outrage? Why so much consternation over the fate of a
little boy who most of them have never met? Why keep a boy from his
father?
</P>
<P>
   ``All we want is for this child to live in liberty,'' said
Miriam Millares, 64, who stood outside of the home of Elian's
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, where the boy is staying. Then
Millares asked a question, one that has cut deeply among Cuban
exiles, even those who would never turn up in front of the house to
pray or chant for Elian. ``Why do Americans have so much hatred for
us?''
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, the feeling is not hatred so much as
bewilderment, and the scene outside the house, with religious
images and Spanish slogans, has made the drama seem all the more
baffling. But Cuban exiles here say there are good reasons for
their anger; it is just that few people outside Miami bother to
listen or to understand their point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fidel is a dictator,'' said Nibia Rodriguez, 50, who left Cuba
in 1961. ``Have people forgotten that?''
</P>
<P>
   Is it so wrong, they ask, that the boy be given his day in
family court, where a judge can say, independently of the federal
government, what is really in his best interest.
</P>
<P>
   They know that Elian's father wants him home. And if home were
Guatemala or France or even Haiti, most Cuban exiles would not have
lifted an eyebrow. But home is Cuba, and Cuba, exiles mostly agree,
is no place for a boy to grow up, not if they can help it, not
after 40 years of butting heads with Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were a good father, he would know that,'' said Norma
Blanco, about Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, communism is something personal and familiar. It is a
city crowded with people whose families were severed, cut in half,
after communism took root in Cuba, and for decades since. People
lost their homes and businesses in the name of ideology. Some lost
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   There are older expatriates, a number of whom stand outside
Elian's house, who pine for what could have been: the house they
could have lived in, the sister they could have shared their years
with, the lives they could have led, had Castro not turned it all
upside down.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a younger generation, the newer arrivals, who hold
a different kind of grudge, the kind nurtured by staying behind and
living communism firsthand. And, while most of the rest of the
United States rarely gives communism a passing thought, at least
not since the Soviet Union turned to rubble, Miami is immersed in
every twist and turn of one of its final outposts. Radio shows
crackle with stories about Cuban political prisoners and jailed
dissidents. They are heroes here, but unknown to most everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Stop an exile on the street, and chances are that the person
will rail that God is frowned upon in Cuba. Then they will point
out that doctors in Cuba get paid about $5 a month, that girls turn
to prostitution to buy a pair of jeans and that some 7-year-old
children go without milk.
</P>
<P>
   Many here remember that Cuban government agents attacked a
tugboat loaded with 63 people, none of them carrying weapons, who
were trying to leave the island for the United States in 1994. At
least 12 children were killed. Some women at Elian's house carry
mimeographed copies of photographs of some of those children.
</P>
<P>
   And no one here has forgotten that Cuban jet fighters had shot
down two planes piloted by the members of the exile group, Brothers
to the Rescue, which patrolled the Florida Straits for Cubans
trying to escape Cuba on rafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He destroys people the way you would destroy bugs,'' said
Marien Collazo, 39, who left Cuba when she was 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they will talk about freedom, or libertad: the
freedom to hate, love, write, shout, eat, buy and think what they
want, without worrying about going to jail, losing their jobs or
ostracizing their children. It is not the kind of thing most people
in this country have ever had to think about, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communism is an experience,'' said Angel Blanco, 53, who
arrived from Cuba in 1962. ``It is not a doctrine. You can't
experience what people feel under communism until you have lived
it, and that is the problem. It's a society based on hate. It's a
society without a God. But it's all disguised with rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   When he looks back on his years in Cuba, Luis Labori, 31, said
he feels as if he had been inside a room where the oxygen level
dropped so slowly a person barely realized it, until it was too
late. People ended up living a kind of double-life, he said,
complacent on the outside, infuriated on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't think for yourself,'' said Labori, who arrived here
in 1994. ``You have to obey and agree with their ideology. You are
against your country, but you can't express that.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is a new tide of resentment, he said, among Cubans
there who feel the island does not even belong to them anymore. It
belongs to the tourists with hard cash, a system Castro created to
save the regime after the fall of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no future there,'' Labori said.
</P>
<P>
   And for the crowd outside Gonzalez's home, the future is what
they say they worry about most of all: what will become of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that Elian will go home a hero of the revolution,
entitled to the perks of the elite _ more food, the best hospitals,
a car, gas, a nice job. But that, they are convinced, will doom
him.
</P>
<P>
   They say they fear Elian will be ``brain-washed'' by the system.
They pointed to Castro's own words, comments he has made about the
boy's ``re-entry'' into Cuban society.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be deprogrammed,'' said Norma Blanco outside Elian's
house.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens when, not if, he grows disillusioned, they ask.
Then, they say, he will be trapped with 2 millions sets of eyes
watching his every move. Fallen revolutionary heroes are not
treated as generously as vaunted ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privilege doesn't matter in the face of oppression,'' Labori
said.

DETROIT HOPES NEW BALLPARK IS STAR PLAYER IN CITY'S REDEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 16th graf, ``This city ..., to delete reference to Jesus
Christ from quote. Also being filed in `a' category.) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Few major cities have talked more about or waited
longer for a visible symbol of resurrection than this one, the
nation's poorest.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the patience will be rewarded on Tuesday, with the
inaugural game at Comerica Park, the new $300 million home of the
Detroit Tigers baseball team and the showpiece of a burgeoning
entertainment district in downtown Detroit. The stadium was built
with city, county, state and private money, and was named for its
corporate sponsor, Comerica Bank in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders are convinced that the ornate open-air stadium,
with its synchronized water fountains and 50-foot-high Ferris
wheel, will drive investment _ not to mention thousands of visitors
_ back downtown, just as Jacobs Field and Camden Yards transformed
Cleveland and Baltimore into banner cities for urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of banners, Tigers officials are quietly picking out
spots to display a World Series banner, should the
down-on-their-luck Tigers bring home the championship, a feat this
99-year-old franchise has not accomplish since 1984. And the way
the team is limping along _ at 1-5, the Tigers have the worst
record in baseball _ fans will probably wait a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've endured a lot of rhetoric over the years,'' said Denise
Illitch, the daughter of Tigers owner Mike Illitch. ``But this
ballpark is real. It's proof things are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Illitch is president of Olympia Development, which is
handling projects surrounding Comerica Park. The Illitch family
also owns the Detroit Red Wings hockey team, which plays at Joe
Louis Arena on the city's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Change is whirling all around the ballpark. Later this week,
construction will begin on an $800 million office complex several
blocks south that will become the headquarters of the Compuware
Corp., which makes software for managing corporate networks. The
company is moving from Farmington Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Just east of the stadium, construction crews are excavating the
site of Ford Field, a brick-and-glass stadium with a dome, also
costing about $300 million, that will sit alongside Comerica Park
and bring the Detroit Lions football team back to the city for the
first time in 26 years. The Lions, who now play in the Silverdome
in suburban Pontiac, plan to open Ford Field in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 3 million people expected to visit Comerica Park
this season will not have to worry about parking or traffic.
They'll walk to the 40,000-seat ballpark. Forty-seven townhouses,
with price tags of $140,000 to $250,000 are being built across the
street, on land that for years had been used by prostitutes and
drug users
</P>
<P>
   Signs advertising loft space pop up daily in the windows of
deserted office buildings nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But most surprising is the nightlife that has crept back, now
that two of the three voter-approved casinos have opened temporary
sites on the fringe of downtown. On most evenings the parking lots
at the MGM Grand and the Motorcity Casino resemble those of
suburban shopping malls. Eventually the casinos will build near the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one here, not even the ever-jubilant Mayor Dennis
Archer, is ready to proclaim Detroit completely reborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not where we want to be,'' Archer said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Huge swaths of the city are dominated by weed-choked lots and
abandoned houses. Some basic services like street lighting and bus
service are still unreliable. That is why many Detroit residents
say they are reluctant to believe that the city's renaissance will
ever extend beyond downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd that we're spending hundreds of millions of
dollars on a new ballpark when we can't keep our libraries open
regular hours and our kids don't even have safe playgrounds,'' said
Frank Rashid, a lifelong resident and founder of the Tiger Stadium
Fan Club, which pleaded with city officials to revitalize Tiger
Stadium. The famed ballpark sits empty about a mile from Comerica
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is fixated on shortcuts to revitalization,'' Rashid
said, relaying on huge projects ``that do nothing but deliver false
promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban planning and economic experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is no evidence that building a new sports stadium
resurrects a downtown or a city,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, an
economics professor at Smith College. ``In cities that are
investing in several downtown projects all at once, there is
additional activity, but it's mostly from the transfer of income
and employment from surrounding communities into the downtown area.
You rarely see a great spread effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mayor contended that Comerica Park was crucial to
Detroit's comeback, if for no other reason than as an morale boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comerica Park will help restore the excitement of urban living
that has been missing far too long from downtown Detroit,'' Archer
said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Comerica Park was designed to dazzle. Life-size
stone tigers and baseball bats guard the entrances. Inside the
ballpark, children can ride a Ferris wheel with seats shaped like
baseballs or a carousel featuring 30 handpainted tigers. The
low-rise outfield stands are expected to be another attraction,
with their postcard view of the city's skyline. Along the wall in
left-center field, huge stainless steel statues of Hall of Fame
players like Hank Greenberg, Ty Cobb and Charlie Gehringer will
keep watch. And the 10-story-tall scoreboard is the largest in
baseball, the Tiger organization says.
</P>
<P>
   As it is with most things, Comerica Park's grandeur comes at a
price. Now that the team offers luxury seats, the price of an
average home game ticket has doubled to $24.83, the fourth highest
in baseball, according to Team Marketing Report.
</P>
<P>
   But even that has done little to spoil this city's excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit has lost so much and had to wait so long for something
to be proud of,'' said 63-year-old Bernard Battistelli, a longtime
Tiger fan, who typically attends 10 to 15 home games a year. ``I'd
rather pay a little extra than sit around another 10 years waiting
for a rebirth.''

 &HT;    Bush takes campaign to Hispanic community
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush today will use a
campaign visit to Cleveland's West Side to outline his plans for
raising Americans on the ``outskirts of poverty'' into the middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he will venture where few, if any, Republican
presidential candidates have gone before in Ohio, to a Hispanic
community center, El Barrio, said state Rep. Jim Trakas
(R-Independence), Cuyahoga County Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of Bush's plan for using ``compassionate
conservatism'' to expand the party's base and reverse the two
straight losses in presidential elections, Trakas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how we're going to do better,'' Trakas said. ``It's in
areas where largely in the past we have not been very active.''
</P>
<P>
   Trakas said that he has worked in every presidential campaign
since 1972 and never had seen a Republican candidate stop at a
Hispanic center.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will tour El Barrio, which offers employment and education
programs for children and adults, and then will deliver his speech
at the West Side Ecumenical Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Bush) understands the needs of the Latino community,''
said Angel Dones, a Bush supporter and editor-in-chief of Nuevos
Horizontes, a Cleveland weekly newspaper. ``People are looking for
leadership that will address the issues _ immigration issues,
educational issues, educational training issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who speaks Spanish, has done well with Hispanic voters in
his two winning campaigns for Texas governor. One exit poll in 1998
showed him winning nearly 50 percent of the Hispanic vote, a strong
showing among a traditionally Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   According to exit polls, about 1 percent of the Ohio voters in
the 1996 and 1998 elections said they were of Hispanic origin, said
Eric Rademacher, codirector of the University of Cincinnati's Ohio
Poll.
</P>
<P>
   However, because Ohio is a bellwether state in presidential
elections, Bush's Cleveland stop with potential Hispanic voters
will attract national, as well as statewide attention, Rademacher
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland stops follow earlier Bush forays in Ohio to areas
usually regarded as rich in Democratic votes _ a storefront church
in a black neighborhood in Cincinnati and a predominantly black
housing project in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech today at the West Side Ecumenical Ministry is
expected to touch on health care, child care, education and
employment opportunities, said one Bush supporter. James Ruvolo,
former Ohio Democratic chairman and an Ohio backer of Vice
President Al Gore, said Bush's efforts to draw support in
traditionally Democratic areas won't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush can go wherever he wants. What matters is his
message. George Bush has no message of accomplishment to talk about
in Ohio,'' Ruvolo said.

MICROSOFT HIRES RALPH REED TO CURRY FAVOR WITH BUSH

 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. has quietly hired Ralph Reed, a
senior consultant to Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign,
to lobby Bush in opposition to the government's antitrust case
against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's aim, the company says, is to curry favor with the
apparent Republican presidential nominee, hoping he will speak out
against the government's case _ and, perhaps, take a softer
approach toward the company if he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, former head of the Christian Coalition, is well situated
to take on the assignment since his firm, Century Strategies, is
one of Bush's top consultants. During the primary campaign, Reed
frequently appeared on television to talk on behalf of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Reed declined to talk about his company's contract with
Microsoft, saying, ``We have a policy of not discussing our
clients.'' Another executive of his company, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said that Microsoft had hired Century Strategies to
lobby other political candidates as well.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Murray, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the company hired
Century Strategies to counter ``a comprehensive lobbying campaign
by our competitors'' to promote the government's suit. The company
also said it had been ``working very hard to get our point of view
across to all the presidential candidates,'' including Vice
President Al Gore. Microsoft has not said how it has lobbied Gore
and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a federal judge found Microsoft in wide violation of
antitrust laws. And in large part because of the government
antitrust suit, Microsoft has been trying to make friends among the
candidates, Republicans and Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
   An accounting by the Center for Responsive Politics shows that,
during the current election season, Microsoft and its employees
have donated more than $727,000 to political parties _ 53 percent
of it to the Republicans and 47 percent to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious goal, while the antitrust case drags through a year
or more of appeals, is to convince the next president, Congress and
the public that the case should be abandoned. But the current
campaign by Reed's company is much more closely targeted to the
Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A series of e-mail messages from John Pudner, senior project
manager for Century Strategies, laid out a detailed plan by Reed's
staff and his contractors to recruit senior Bush supporters from
around the country in an effort to undermine the government's suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush supporters _ and the e-mail showed that Pudner is
screening them carefully to make sure they are influential within
the campaign _ are being asked to write letters to Bush saying they
believe the government's case is misguided, and that the American
people oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Pudner's e-mail messages instruct ``state operatives'' of the
firm to send him biographical information about Bush supporters who
could help influence the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Only after he has verified that the supporters are sufficiently
influential are the regional lobbyists, working on contract for
Century Strategies, authorized to solicit more letters.
</P>
<P>
   Pudner said that the company intended to gather the letters
through the end of this month. ``We will reject letters that are
not from someone'' the company counts as influential, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mails were made available to The New York Times by a
recipient who did not agree with the goals of the campaign. One
lobbyist said that Century Strategies was offering the regional
contractors $300 a letter _ a high price for this sort of work.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his e-mail solicitations, Pudner distributed the
results of a Microsoft-sponsored national opinion poll taken late
last month. It offers the conclusion that Americans do not support
the case against Microsoft, and Pudner wrote that it was a
``powerful'' tool ``to demonstrate how strongly Americans support
Microsoft's position in the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by Zogby International. In an interview,
John Zogby, president of the company, said Microsoft wrote the poll
questions, though Zogby vetted them before running the survey.
</P>
<P>
   In the poll, questioners were asked how they ranked their state
attorney general's pursuit of the Microsoft case against other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   These other issues include ``charges that airlines are not
properly maintaining and repairing their jets,'' that ``the
pharmaceutical industry overcharges for prescription drugs,'' that
``oil and gas companies are trying to control the cost of
gasoline'' and ``banks charge excessive fees to customers who use
ATMs.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Microsoft antitrust case ranked dead last.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa who leads the 19 state
attorneys general who joined with the Justice Department in suing
Microsoft, said he believed the poll was ``slanted _ we all know
how it's going to turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   According to evidence introduced at the antitrust trial,
Microsoft has a history of trying to write public opinion polls
that guarantee an outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Just over two years ago, shortly before Bill Gates was to appear
before a Senate committee in Washington, he wrote an e-mail to his
subordinates in which he said: ``It would HELP ME IMMENSELY to have
a survey showing that 90 percent of developers believe that putting
the browser into the operating system makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's decision to build a Web browser into Windows set off
the government's current antitrust case. And in a subsequent string
of e-mails, Microsoft employees laid out how they would pose the
questions to get the answers Gates wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, the Microsoft spokesman, said the company had received
documents demonstrating that rivals were engaged in similar
lobbying efforts against Microsoft. Some he offered were two years
old; they showed auto dealers and others congratulating state
attorneys general for filing suit against Microsoft. But one
lobbyist for a Microsoft competitor confirmed that similar lobbying
against Microsoft continues today.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Century Strategies lobbying campaign has not clearly
moved Bush into Microsoft's camp. Asked about the case last week,
just after the judge's ruling, Bush said that as president he would
``fully enforce antitrust laws.'' But he said he would not discuss
specifics of the case because it remained in litigation.

QUARTERLY SALES AND PROFIT RISE SHARPLY AT MOTOROLA 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Motorola Inc., the telecommunications and
semiconductor giant, reported another quarter of strong sales and
profit growth on Monday, which could provide a lift to flagging
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by strong demand for its cellular phones and
semiconductors, Motorola has been staging a turnaround in its
traditional businesses and remaking itself into a company that is
already profiting from the growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the company said that revenue rose sharply, to $8.8
billion, up about 20 percent from $7.3 billion in the first quarter
of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Profit more than doubled, to $449 million, or 59 cents a diluted
share, compared with $184 million, or 26 cents a share, in the
quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts, who had been forecasting a profit of 58
cents, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, cheered the
report. ``This is a very good number,'' said Mona Eraiba of Gruntal
&AMP; Co. in New York. ``They've turned around in an amazing way.''
</P>
<P>
   The company announced its results after the close of regular
trading. Its shares fell $3, to $150, during the regular session
but climbed as high as $157 after hours.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola reported double-digit growth in sales and profit in
most of its divisions, but the strongest sales growth came in its
cellular phone and semiconductor units, which both reported sales
gains of 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But while semiconductor profit rose more than tenfold, operating
profit in the cellular phone unit fell to $49 million from $84
million in the quarter a year earlier because of higher costs
related to a shortage in telephone components and a shift toward
sales of less expensive handsets. It was one of the few troubling
items in the report. ``They had a very good number, but it was
marred by the lower margins in cellular telephones,'' Eraiba said.
``Motorola will have to address that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the analysts are largely pleased with Motorola's progress. A
little more than a year ago, Motorola was faltering, losing market
share in cellular phones and suffering from a downturn in
semiconductor equipment. It was also writing off millions of
dollars because of its failed investment in Iridium LLC, the
satellite telephone venture.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a technology and Internet boom is bolstering demand for
cellular phones and semiconductors. And Motorola has been
refashioning itself into a software and Internet company, forming
alliances with Internet and networking companies and developing
phones equipped with Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it will be at the center of the ``wired world,'' Motorola
also made its biggest acquisition last year, buying General
Instrument Corp., the largest maker of cable set-top boxes, in the
hope of establishing itself in the interactive-television market.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Motorola, which were trading as low as $87 in October,
rose as high as $184 early in March before dropping over the last
month.
</P>
<P>
   With profit expected to reach $2 billion this year, on revenue
of $38 billion, however, Motorola now needs to convince Wall Street
that its sales and profit can continue to grow in an increasingly
competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   The company is already one of the world's largest technology
providers _ its $30 billion in revenue last year compares with $19
billion for Microsoft _ which is part of the reason Motorola is
expanding into everything from wired homes, automobiles and even
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola has also been spending heavily in advertising and
marketing, and remaking itself in the image of a hip company with
jazzy walkie-talkies and several lines of cellular phones equipped
with Internet browsers that come in vibrant colors and light, slick
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons we have a strong buy on the stock,''
said Brian Modoff, an analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
``They understand the market a lot more than they used to.''

 &HT;    Cash flow isn't slow for Doyle these days
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ One of the rooms at the Doyle household
in LaGrange, Ga., is filled with enough silver and crystal to serve
a large party. This also serves as the perfect demarcation between
Allen Doyle's two worlds as a very successful golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an amateur, you've got to polish your winnings,'' Doyle's
wife, Kate said. ``As a pro, you get to spend them.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, not much has changed for the ex-hockey player who has
used his wrist-shot-like swing to score big time in his second
career on the links. He spent most of his 30s and 40s as one of the
nation's top amateurs, winning everything but money. His sole
income for five years was operating Doyle's Golf Center, a
no-frills driving range near his home.
</P>
<P>
   But since turning professional at 46, he's more than cashed in
on his talents, earning almost $2.5 million on the Nike, PGA and
Senior PGA tours. This week he will celebrate the most significant
victory of his career when he defends his title in the 61st PGA
Seniors' Championship at PGA National, one of four titles he earned
last year as a rookie on the 50-and-older circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that changed my life because I think I'm the
same guy now that I was then,'' Doyle said. ``But if you would have
asked me what I thought it would have been like, I would have sold
it short. You can't fathom what it's like to win a major on
national TV; at least I couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Doyle hasn't changed since he shot an eight-under
64 in the final round to overtake Vicente Fernandez and win by two
shots. When Doyle's home, he still gets up early and is at his
driving range at 8 every morning to mow the grass and pick up balls
and shoot the bull with his customers.
</P>
<P>
   But, like his swing, Doyle's golf career has not traveled the
usual path. It's been that way from the start as he honed his flat
swing in the 8-foot ceiling cellar of the house he grew up in the
Boston suburb of Norwood.
</P>
<P>
   In his early days in golf, everyone tried to get him to change
his unorthodox swing, saying he would never get far with it. ``Once
I beat them, they stopped saying how funny the swing looked,''
Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   While many of today's stars were raised in country clubs, Doyle
learned the sport playing on municipal courses. When he accepted a
scholarship to college, it was to be a hockey player at Norwich
University, where he was a defensemen who didn't mind throwing
checks, as well as a few fists.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Army in South Korea, Doyle and his wife
relocated to Georgia to continue his military service. They thought
briefly about him turning professional, but then she became
pregnant with the first of their two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think that was the time for me to be leaving home,''
Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   So he took a job at a textile factory, spending most of his days
making carpets instead of birdies. His amateur career started to
flourish, however, and eventually he quit the textile business so
he could run an American Legion golf course that would give him
more time to work on his game.
</P>
<P>
   And he did have game: He won six Georgia Amateur titles, played
on two Walker Cup teams, three World Amateur teams, one with Tiger
Woods,
</P>
<P>
   and was the top-ranked amateur in the United States in 1994. He
was the
</P>
<P>
   medalist in the 1991 U.S. Amateur and lost in the 1992
semifinals to Justin Leonard. It's not a stretch to say he's the
greatest amateur player in Georgia since Bobby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around Georgia and the Southeast, I won't say I was a legend,
but I won most everything I played in,'' Doyle said. ``I had some
stature in the game that few people achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he hit his mid-40s, he knew the driving range wasn't
going to be enough if he wanted to send his two daughters to the
colleges of their choice. So he turned pro, which may not have been
the gamble everyone else thought it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allen would have never turned pro if he didn't think he was
going to be successful,'' his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on a sponsor's exemption, he finished in the top 25 in
his first Nike event, which got him into the next week's
tournament, which he won. By the time that year was over, Doyle had
won three times, including the Tour Championship, to earn a spot on
the 1996 PGA Tour, becoming the oldest rookie ever at 47.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled his next two years on the PGA Tour (finishing 140th
and 189th on the money list) because of his lack of distance off
the tee. But this experience kept his game sharp until he became
eligible for the Senior Tour, easily earning a spot in late 1998 as
medalist of Qualifying School.
</P>
<P>
   He won in Naples, then again two months later with his rally at
the PGA Seniors'. He overcame an early double-bogey with a 31 on
the back nine that included no 4s on his scorecard (he had seven 3s
and two 5s). That was the highlight in a year in which he finished
third on the money list with more than $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else found out what we've known for a long time,''
said oldest daughter Erin, a senior at Southern Mississippi. ``Dad
can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle's only regret during last year's PGA Seniors' was he
didn't include an old hockey helmet in his bag that he could have
worn walking up the 18th fairway. Sort of like Red Auerbach's
victory cigar.
</P>
<P>
   But Doyle has no regrets about the rest of his life. He doesn't
consider it a mistake he spent all those years as an amateur before
finally turning pro at such a late age.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did I shortchange myself along the way?'' he said. ``I
never, ever second-guessed anything. Now if I went through three
wives and my kids hated me, like anyone, I would say I should have
done this different. I'm on top of the world, anyway.''

VESTIGES OF A GRAND LIFE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It must have been great to be a British governor general.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine it. When the job was still worth having, it came
with complete authority to rule over your colony. Better yet, all
your bosses were half a world away, in an era when that meant they
really had no idea how well you were living. Which was probably
just as well: Most governors general lived quite nicely. When not
putting down the odd local insurrection, they could retreat to
spectacular hilltop homes, their every care (and afternoon tea)
anticipated by an overly large staff.
</P>
<P>
   That way of life died out quickly with the end of colonialism.
No doubt that is largely a good thing _ the quality of rule rarely
matched the governor's quality of life. But fortunately some of the
houses survive, complete with their carefully rolled lawns, their
sumptuous breakfasts and _ in the case of Carcosa, the spectacular
102-year-old mansion in the hills above Kuala Lumpur _ a small army
of butlers and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The mansion, with seven guest suites, is now part of a small
luxury hotel called Carcosa Seri Negara; a second mansion, with six
more suites, is under renovation after a fire in February.
</P>
<P>
   Carcosa Seri Negara is one of the few places in Asia to recall
an era long gone. It is all about atmosphere, from the gentle
breezes in the morning, to the iguanas that scamper across the
paths when you are out on a morning walk, to the wide veranda,
where you half expect to see Evelyn Waugh sunk into a weathered
wicker chair, scratching out his next novel and barking at the
waiters.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that Queen Elizabeth II settled in at Carcosa
Seri Negara when she visited this former British colony in the fall
of 1998. After all, there's not much sense of Asian adventure when
you check in at the Ritz-Carlton downtown, one of the many hotels
that feel more like Manhattan than what was once British Malaya.
</P>
<P>
   There have been concessions to modern times at Carcosa Seri
Negara. Every suite has been air-conditioned and updated; in mine,
the veranda had been glassed in to create a cool seating area. When
the wind parted the branches, I could just make out the Petronas
Twin Towers, the world's tallest buildings, a symbol of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's single-minded determination to
transform this tropical capital into a wired financial powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But best of all, every suite comes with a personal butler. Mine
was a witty, personable veteran of Carcosa life: Vicky Manian, who
made sure the right fruits and magazines were on the teak desk in
my room, drove me around town on my appointments in a wonderfully
battered old Mercedes, and punctuated every trip with tales of the
hotel's odder guests. (He had only good things to say about the
Queen.) But more about him in a moment.
</P>
<P>
   I had long wanted to stay at Carcosa. In 15 years of bouncing
around in Asia, I've been fascinated with the grand old homes that
served as the seat of colonial power.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's their graceful shutters, or the constant clacking of
the ceiling fans, but every one of them seems haunted by the
history of failed attempts at colonial rule in Asia _ the subtext
of the region's politics to this day. The houses are at once
fabulously luxurious and a little sad, reminders of an age that has
virtually disappeared in the 25 years since the end of the Vietnam
War. And the few that still stand are often in the shadows of
Singapore's skyscrapers or Saigon's cell-phone towers.
</P>
<P>
   They are hard to find and harder to get into. The former home of
the American governor general of the Philippines today sits behind
a huge fence and serves as the office of the American ambassador _
complete with its huge seaside veranda, commanding a view of
Corregidor, where Gen. Douglas MacArthur famously promised to
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably a good thing for American foreign policy that
these walls can't talk,'' one past ambassador said to me over lunch
one day, after guiding me through the house's former bedrooms and
recounting the off-color legends of how Washington's men in Manila
kept themselves entertained during long tropical nights.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the spectacular mansion in Hong Kong. I
interviewed Christopher Patten, Britain's last governor there, just
weeks before the city was returned to China in 1997. As we talked,
the remnants of empire were literally being packed up and shipped
back to London: old oil paintings, maps of the island, books so
dusty it seemed unlikely anyone had taken them off the shelves for
a half century or so.
</P>
<P>
   The place so reeked of colonial power that Patten's
Chinese-appointed successor, Tung Chee-hwa, decided not to move
into the house. He operates from an office tower instead. It's more
professional, but it's got half the view and none of the romance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carcosa was built above Kuala Lumpur in 1897 and 1898 as the
home of Sir Frank Swettenham, the first resident general of the
Federated Malay States. (At the time, the governor general still
lived in Singapore, long before its separation from what is now
called Malaysia.)
</P>
<P>
   Later, Swettenham wrote endless tomes about life in the Malay
Peninsula, in which he makes only passing reference to the mansion
he commissioned. But he had a flair for the dramatic _ the land
around Carcosa plunges straight into the jungle, then opens into
the formal Lake Gardens below, an effort by the British to create a
touch of Cotswold-like landscaping at the Equator.
</P>
<P>
   The house, on 40 acres, looks like a British summer mansion,
with some vaguely Moorish accents to the windows. Naturally
Swettenham reserved for himself the most spectacular of the house's
huge rooms, just over the front entrance, presumably so he could
keep an eye on the restless populace below.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he should have been watching the Japanese, who used the
house to make their top officers comfortable during World War II.
But by the time the British regained control of Malaya, life at
Carcosa wasn't quite as much fun. An insurgency to oust the British
dragged on for more than a decade, and the house was soon encircled
with barbed wire. (The property is still fenced in, as I discovered
on a hike.) But barbed wire alone could not protect the residents.
</P>
<P>
   One top British official living in Seri Negara, the adjacent
house on the property, went out for a weekend drive during ``the
emergency'' of the 1950s and never returned. His bullet-riddled
body was found by the road. (Undeterred, Richard Nixon stayed in
Seri Negara a few years later, as vice president.)
</P>
<P>
   Later the hotel became the backdrop for ``The Seventh Dawn,''
starring William Holden. Even after the creation of modern
Malaysia, the house became the residence of the British high
commissioner, and was outfitted with Oriental furniture. It became
a hotel in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place certainly has history,'' Vicky Manian told me, as he
escorted me up the sweeping grand staircase _ all teak, of course _
to my suite. It also has luxury. The suites are large _ big wooden
beds, comfortable sitting areas, marble baths with gold-plated
water works.
</P>
<P>
   There are now saunas and a gym in a pavilion behind Carcosa and
tennis courts and an outdoor pool. The biggest suite, called the
Grand Suite, comes with a private dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs in the main dining room, which looks more or less
like a generic country club, the walls are the same, but the
traditions have changed. The waiters no longer wear headdresses, a
staple of the official dinners in the '20s and '30s. The Filipino
band no longer plays on the veranda.
</P>
<P>
   But the dining room, which serves Malaysian and Continental
fare, remains a gathering place for Malaysia's political elite.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad used to dine here with his deputy,
Anwar Ibrahim, before Mahathir felt threatened by the suave Anwar's
growing political popularity.
</P>
<P>
   These days the prime minister still drops in for an official
dinner now and again; Anwar eats nightly in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The political risks for visitors are far less _ you are free to
critique the curry and the breakneck drivers in Malaysia, just not
the prime minister _ and no one should miss Carcosa's famous curry
tiffin, a specialty on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   The economic risks are also slight, at least for now. My suite,
one of the midsized, cost about $200 a night, about half the rack
rate _ a reflection of the downturn in tourism after the Asian
economic crisis. Dinner was another $60 for two, without wine, and
the car service is extra as well, depending on time and distance.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not much more than you would pay for a luxury hotel
down in the shadow of the world's tallest skyscrapers. And down
there, no governor general ever ruled, no iguanas scamper about, no
Communist infiltrators ever tried to break through the barbed wire,
and no lazy ceiling fan clacks away as you read the paper.

UNASSUMING SINGH FORCES FANS TO NOTICE HIM AT LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   People entered the Masters talking about Tiger Woods, but they
left the Masters talking about Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is low key by nature, because his interviews are not
filled with one-liners, because he lacks the charisma of Woods,
Singh doesn't always receive the attention given to many of the
world's best players. But by winning his second major, Singh has
forced people to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   Only five players under the age of 40 have won two major
championships _ Singh, who is 37, Woods, John Daly, Ernie Els and
Lee Janzen. After winning the Masters in unflappable style by three
strokes on Sunday, Singh talked about the satisfaction of wearing
an Augusta National Golf Club green jacket, when many believed that
he never would.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you win one major, people may say you just had a good
week,'' said Singh, who won the PGA Championship in 1998. ``But
winning two majors kind of puts you on a different level.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh was on a level all his own during the final two rounds.
This Masters lacked some of the back-nine drama of recent years,
but Singh's steady play did not leave room for much drama. He took
a big step toward winning on Saturday, playing 14 superb holes at
two under par, dealing with gusts of 25 to 40 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It took a ball-striker of the highest order to shoot under par
in those conditions, but ball-striking is Singh's forte. All of
those years of hitting balls on the range, earning his reputation
as one of the game's hardest workers, paid dividends for Singh, who
never wavered in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Sunday, Singh's pursuers gradually fell away, one by
one. Neither Phil Mickelson nor Davis Love III mounted a Sunday
charge. Duval made a costly bogey at No. 13, after a terrible
second shot into the water. Els kept missing putts on the back nine
that he needed to make. Woods failed to break 70 in the first two
rounds, and his shaky putting on Thursday and Friday may have cost
him the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Singh followed one of the classic mottoes in sports _
don't beat yourself. Jack Nicklaus followed that motto many times
in majors. And even when Singh did make a final-round blunder at
No. 11, hitting his second shot into the water, he minimized the
damage by scrambling for bogey to maintain the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Singh's victory will end speculation about Woods winning the
Grand Slam this year. Woods wanted this Masters badly, and he may
have won if he had putted better. But for any player, including
Woods, winning majors is always difficult. In fact, winning any
tournament is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Love, Duval, Els and Justin Leonard have all gone more than a
year without winning on tour. Both Duval and Mickelson, with 26
career victories between them, are still seeking their first major
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the entire week, with big names galore on the leader board,
was further evidence that the world's best players are stepping up
their games, which should be great for golf.
</P>
<P>
   Who says Woods doesn't have a rival? It may not be the same guy
week in and week out who challenges him. But plenty of players are
confident that despite Woods' presence there is plenty of winning
left for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how those who didn't win react to
the disappointment. Woods, Duval, Love, Mickelson and Els had all
been pointing toward the Masters since the year began, and Sunday
night had to be difficult for all of them. Golf can be a cruel
sport.
</P>
<P>
   The world's best tennis players win most of the time. The
world's best boxers win almost all the time. But the world's best
golfers taste defeat far more often than they experience victory.
No wonder so many golfers talk regularly to sports psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how good you are, it is impossible to have a long
career in golf without experiencing huge disappointments, and the
elite golfers must learn how to overcome them.
</P>
<P>
   During the next few tournaments, there will be somewhat of a
post-Masters lull until the weeks leading up the next major, the
U.S. Open in June at Pebble Beach, Calif. Singh has played well at
Pebble Beach, and he finished third in last year's U.S. Open at
Pinehurst, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Singh can savor a victory that was well deserved,
for a quiet family man from Fiji. It was further evidence that golf
is truly a global game. And as he wore his green jacket on Sunday
night, Singh felt like a man sitting on top of the world. &QL;

ST. MARK PASSION: PART BACH, PART PASTICHE, PART SHERLOCK HOLMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ruins inspire either engineers or mystics. The latter
stand among the broken columns hoping for moonlight and musing on
the folly of human aspiration. Engineers see a job left undone, or
in the case of Bach's ``St. Mark Passion,'' a job vanished with few
traces left behind. Restoration is their motto: build on existing
foundations, learn from history as you can; take a flyer on the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   The mystic sees deterioration as patina taken to extremes: a
thing made more beautiful by age and wear. For Ton Koopman, who
brought his reconstruction of the ``St. Mark Passion'' to the
Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Sunday afternoon, nothing else but
a house in working order would do. Koopman had not even ruins to
work with, only a blueprint. The text for a ``St. Mark Passion''
appears in the complete poetic works of Picander, published at
Leipzig in 1731. Picander was librettist for the ``St. Matthew
Passion'' (which survives gloriously intact); Bach was responsible
for the city's Passion music.
</P>
<P>
   Bach, with his weekly load of music to provide for services,
borrowed extensively from himself. Therefore the music for the St.
Mark would necessarily be on loan, and would fit Picander's texts.
Some of Koopman's matchups are inspired. As the chorus jeers for
Jesus to descend from the cross (``Pfui dich, wie fein zerbrichts
du den Tempel''), the music obligingly plunges in a series of
chromatic scales.
</P>
<P>
   Passions by definition describe Christ's progress to the cross.
Embellishing the story is poetic commentary (choruses, vocal solos
and ensembles) and the four-part chorales, hymnlike pauses for
contemplation by both performers and congregation.
</P>
<P>
   From Picander we infer that the St. Mark was lighter on the
poetry than either the St. Matthew or the St. John but heavier on
chorales. Having literally hundreds to choose from, Koopman had
here perhaps his easiest time, and he has taken some of Bach's more
weirdly beautiful harmonizations. There are even more cantatas, and
from them Koopman has appropriated the appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The recitatives, the narration binding all these replacement
parts together, Koopman has composed himself, relying on his long
experience as a conductor and keyboard player in the early-music
wars. If Bach's own recitatives are filled with steep and sudden
modulation, the new ones go even farther. There were cliff-hanging
moments suspended between tonalities, difficult for both the
afternoon's splendid Evangelist Max Ciolek and the listener's ear
to manage.
</P>
<P>
   Before we can say what the ``St. Mark Passion'' really is we
have to know what to call it. In a way it is all-Bach with the
right text and a reasonable representation of the ``real thing.''
The narrative is followed clearly, and the individual pieces are
worth our while. On the other hand, Koopman's borrowed goods are
not the original composer's choice, and who knows what Bach would
have stolen from himself. Indeed, this St. Mark is a little like
staging ``Hamlet'' on the set of ``Twelfth Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``A Passion After Bach'' would say it best: a medley of
church pieces configured for Protestant worship at Easter. It can
be both practical (great sacred music fitted to the season) and a
scholar's parlor game (musicology that is part Sherlock Holmes,
part divination, part personal ego).
</P>
<P>
   Mystics, I think, would have invited Koopman to go away and
leave the ``St. Mark Passion'' alone. They might say that lost
Bach, along with the Mahler Tenth and Schubert ``Unfinished''
Symphonies, are best left in ruins, not treated as handyman's
specials. Andras Schiff often plays as an encore a ravishing
fragment of a Schubert piano piece, leaving it to break off in
midsentence. Left behind as he leaves the stage are the beauty of
the music, a wistfulness over the unknown and an added value: the
heightened sense of human aspiration in all its folly.
</P>
<P>
   Koopman's excellent Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra and Choir were
passionate believers in the ``St. Mark Passion,'' but Bach's more
complex counterpoint was generally blurred by its surroundings. If
St. Ignatius looks the part, its echoes are unfriendly to narrow
complication. The soloists, all good, were Deborah York, soprano;
Annette Markert, mezzo-soprano; Paul Agnew, tenor; and Peter Kooy
and Klaus Mertens, basses. The event was a presentation of Lincoln
Center's Great Performers series.

   Germany Plays Host To a World's Fair &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Expo 2000, Germany's first World's Fair, takes place June 1 to
Oct. 31 in historic Hanover. Forty million people are expected to
visit the city's 400-acre exhibition site for the five-month fair,
whose theme is ``Humankind, Nature and Technology.'' With a record
172 countries participating, Expo 2000 organizers promise a
diverse, ecologically oriented fair. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Attractions include the Japanese Pavilion, built mostly from
recycled paper, and the Rueda de la Fortuna, a half-subterranean
Ferris wheel that plunges passengers from darkness into daylight
with every turn, created by Gabriel Orozco, a Mexican artist. The
French architect Jean Nouvel has contributed futuristic
installations called ``The Future of Work'' and ``Mobility,'' the
latter incorporating a representation of a space station.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan-African Pavilion features environmental topics, with
hundreds of butterflies from Kenya to add color. National Day
celebrations vary from ethnic dance and cultural performances by
more than 40 African states to a special appearance by the Vienna
Philharmonic (June 17). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nightly laser shows, open-air cinema, art exhibitions and 100
daily cultural events are part of a busy schedule at Expo 2000. A
marathon 21-hour production of Goethe's ``Faust,'' starring Bruno
Ganz, will have its premiere on July 22 and 23, and will be
performed 16 times.
</P>
<P>
   New ballets for the dance festival have been created by Ea Sola
from Vietnam, William Forsythe and Pina Bausch, and the eclectic
musical roster includes the Berlin Philharmonic, Carlos Santana and
700 concerts by international youth chorales. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two streetcar lines link Expo 2000 to central Hanover and a
bullet train links the Expo site to major German and European
cities, including Amsterdam. Individual day passes bought in
advance cost $34. Budget family or group plans are available.
Ticket information and event schedules are available through
www.expo2000.de or DER Travel at (847) 430-0000 and General Tours
Inc. at (603) 357-5033 or (800) 469-5186. &QL;

   National Parks Limit Use of Jet Skis &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The use of personal watercraft (Jet Skis, Sea-Doos and the like)
in the National Park system is no longer expanding without limits.
A new rule, effective April 20, bans them from 13 areas where they
have been in use, as well as from virtually all the other 379 units
of the service. Their use continues to be permitted, for the
moment, in 21 places. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this rule, in theory, you could back your car up to the
Reflecting Pool in Washington and put your personal watercraft
in,'' said David Barna, a parks spokesman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In nine sites, all National Recreation Areas with artificial
lakes that have extensive motorboating, as well as in the open
waters of Gateway National Recreation Area in New York,
personal-watercraft use may continue under ``prudent'' park
management. In 11 others, evaluation of the impact will continue
over two years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the rule, the service said that a dramatic
increase in personal-watercraft use had been noted in the 34 park
units where there is motorboating. All 34 fall under some part of
the new rule. ``This rule takes a conservative approach,'' the park
service rule said, ``based on consideration of potential resource
impacts, conflicts with other visitors' uses and enjoyment and
safety concerns.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the areas where jet skis are no longer permitted, Voyageurs,
near International Falls, Minn., is likely to provoke the most
controversy. When their use was first allowed there, the limits
were defined as the areas where snowmobiles were permitted in
winter. The possibility that snowmobiles may now also be restricted
is not ruled out by the park service. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A list of places where personal watercraft will be banned and
where they are still allowed is available on the Web at www
.nps.gov/refdesk/hotdocs.htm. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The theater is the new home of the Soho Theater Company, which
was founded in 1969 and has launched various playwrights, including
Hanif Kureishi, Timberlake Wertenbaker, Pam Gems and Sue Townsend.
It has co-produced plays with other companies, the Royal Court
among them. &QL;

Russian immigrants in England, through May 13; ``Be My Baby,'' by
Amanda Whittington, about unwed mothers, from May 18 to June 17;
and ``Angels and Saints'' by Jessica Townsend, about the spiritual
and sexual awakening of a middle-aged spinster, from May 18 to June
17. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices range from $8 for previews to $17.50 on Friday and
Saturday. The Soho Theater and Writers' Center is at 21 Dean

   Birthday Parties at the Library of Congress &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In celebration of the bicentennial of its founding on April 24,
1800, the Library of Congress in Washington will present two
exhibitions.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas Jefferson,'' from April 24 to Oct. 31, pays tribute to
the third president, a prime force in the founding of the Library
of Congress. After the British burned the library in the Capitol in
1814, Jefferson sold 6,487 books to the government. More than 2,000
of them that survived an 1851 fire, as well as replacements, will
be on display for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, letters, documents and drawings will illuminate
Jefferson's complexities and contradictions. Featured items include
the original ``Rough draught'' of the Declaration of Independence
in Jefferson's hand, account books from his Monticello plantation
showing items purchased from slave families, and his instructions
to Lewis and Clark as they undertook their search for a land route
to the Pacific. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wizard of Oz: An American Fairy Tale,'' opening on Friday
and continuing through Sept. 23, will mark the 100th anniversary of
one of the best-known copyrights ever issued by the Library of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will see L. Frank Baum's handwritten application to
copyright ``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' in 1900. Film clips, movie
props, photographs and other artifacts will be on display. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A free birthday party on April 24 from noon to 2 p.m. on the
Thomas Jefferson Building's Neptune Plaza will feature a few
``living legends.'' Guests will include Gen. Colin Powell, Maurice
Sendak, and Big Bird from ``Sesame Street.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both exhibitions are in the Library's Jefferson Building, 10
First Street SE on Capitol Hill, and both are free. Information:

share their father,'' Mrs. Pataki, 49, said. (The children are
Emily, 21; Ted, 18; Allison, 15; and George Owen, 12.) ``But there

immigrants outside Dade County, Fla. Union City's mayor, Raul
Garcia, 36, who was born in Cuba but grew up here, said that many

practice don't seem so funny anymore. In the coming months, Iridium
L.L.C., the bankrupt global satellite telephone company, will begin
sending 88 giant satellites, like this one depicted in an artist's

visit the island unless they are journalists, visiting family or on

VENTURI REVEALS THE OBVIOUS, NOT OOSTERHUIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Oosterhuis is knocking at the Masters' outhouse. Six years
after banning Gary McCord for chronic naughtiness, the Masters must
be readying Oosterhuis' 2001 credential for a trip through the
shredder.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain what will happen in light of Oosterhuis'
Bill Walton-like description of Vijay Singh's missed putt on the
eighth hole of Sunday's final round: ``That is a horrible
misjudgment of the line. He knew it was going to be slick, but he
just got it started in the wrong direction. About the worst putt
we've seen.'' Later, Oosterhuis described the putt as horrid.
</P>
<P>
   Oosterhuis should be praised, of course, not condemned. More
often than not, he, Peter Kostis, Bobby Clampett and David Feherty
amply display their ability to analyze a shot before, not after,
the golfer swings. But by the evidence of Sunday's round, Ken
Venturi's penchant for obviousness as CBS' lead analyst is matched
only by his predilection for after-the-fact analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Take David Duval's second shot at the 13th, one of the round's
most important. As Duval assessed the distance and wind, Venturi
used his half-century of golf savvy to say, ``Anything in the creek
would be a mistake.'' Then he predicted, ``He's going to try to, I
feel, put it between Vijay Singh's golf ball and the flag stick and
not go at the flag stick.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysis conveyed what we thought he thought. But he really
didn't think that, or if he did, he wasn't very serious about it.
When Duval plunked the ball in the lake, Venturi told us what he
really thought, to fit the result: ``Look out! Look out! Wrong
move. I knew when he started going at the yardage to the hole, he
was thinking of going straight. That's a mental error.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's what he knew beforehand, why didn't he say it rather
than what he said but didn't really mean?
</P>
<P>
   When Tiger Woods lined up a birdie putt on the ninth hole,
Venturi did not say what he thought about how Woods would strike
the ball or where it should go. Instead, he said: ``He's not
jockeying around for position. He's coming out trying to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Only after the putt went wide right did Venturi say what he
should have offered in advance: ``That putt is a fooler. You'd
swear it has to go left with the slope of the front of the green.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments bespoke his decades of experience; why not use it
prospectively?
</P>
<P>
   When Loren Roberts birdied the ninth hole, following the looping
break of the green perfectly, Venturi waited until the ball was
nearly into the hole before saying: ``That tells us you something
about the break. Look out! Look out!''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the early warning.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when Loren Roberts prepared to chip onto the 10th
green, Kostis said: ``This chip will have some 15 or 20 feet of
break if he chooses the right line. Anything reasonably direct will
run on by.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Before a Duval putt on the 17th hole, Oosterhuis said: ``Uphill,
a little left to right. It's a little slower than most people
expect it today.'' The putt came up short.
</P>
<P>
   Venturi remains an avuncular presence, better suited to
reminiscing than to the task of lead analyst from the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Any comparison of Venturi to NBC's Johnny Miller is specious.
Analysis requires regularly saying something surprising or unusual,
or offering opinions on plays or putts before they happen. Now is
the time for CBS to install Kostis, Oosterhuis, Feherty or Bobby
Clampett at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   CBS came up short on Singh's birdie putt at No. 18, which ended
the tournament. Venturi and Jim Nantz never said he was going for a
birdie, nor did they mention it after he sank it. CBS also failed
to provide an illustration summing up Singh's final putt and score,
or to show all the final results until several minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The angle that showed Singh's shot was memorable, as the
expectant gallery gradually rose as the putt neared the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Venturi concluded the day in this incisive fashion:
``There's no doubt that he played the best golf of the week, and
the best golfer this week won the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the banality.
</P>
<P>
   Some other Masters points:
</P>
<P>
   THE RATINGS _ When Tiger Woods looks as if he can't win, ratings
suffer. He faded on Sunday's back nine, finished six strokes behind
Singh and CBS' Nielsen rating fell 2 percent to a 9.9 from last
year, when Jose Maria Olazabal won.
</P>
<P>
   THE OPENING _ CBS teed up the final round with a gauzy,
sepia-toned opener starring Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Byron
Nelson and Sam Snead that looked as spontaneous and unscripted as a
World Wrestling Federation match. Who knew they allowed cue cards
past the magnolia lane of Augusta?
</P>
<P>
   THE EVER-ROSY VIEW _ Nantz's dramatic, whispered reverence never
flagged, nor did his retelling of Singh's personal story, which
probably caused a global rush to locate the best Fijian courses. He
also described Snead, 87, as being ``as limber as ever'' as he
walked gingerly from the ceremonial first shots on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ENBERG UNDERUSED _ Dick Enberg was underutilized in his limited
role from Butler Cabin; that first shot of him with Nantz on Sunday
was clearly a surprise to everyone, and made both men look
unprepared. And darned if Enberg missed a chance at looking
painfully awkward beside the master of the Masters, William
(Hootie) Johnson, during the emotional thud of the green jacket
ceremony, which Nantz moderated. Enberg's closing essay was rife
with his trademark emotional, sometimes purplish touches, none more
apt than his description of Augusta's ``leafy coiffure.'' &QL;

BARGAINS ARE FADING IN ASIA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bad news these days about travel to eastern Asia is that the
region has reverted from being the certifiable steal that it was at
the height of the economic crisis two years ago to once again being
comparably priced with many other parts of the world _ or even
pricier.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, if that's the right term when bargains are
evaporating, is that the region's many currencies seem finally to
have stabilized, and budgeting for travel once again seems possible
throughout much of the area, even when making reservations a few
months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Most Asian currencies have strengthened handsomely from their
lows of two years ago, accounting for the largest rise in costs for
travel by Americans and others with United States dollars. A
dramatic case in point is Japan, where the yen has appreciated by
22 percent since early April 1998, to about 105 yen to the dollar
from about 135 yen.
</P>
<P>
   Prices in yen have scarcely changed in two years' time; indeed
many have decreased marginally in the recession that hangs over the
country. But that will be little comfort to holders of dollars, who
will have to buy yen at a much higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Tokyo today will pay about 44,000 yen, about $420,
to stay in a double-occupancy room at the Okura Hotel, one of the
city's top business hotels, and 38,000, $360, for one in the Westin
Tokyo, another favorite among visiting business people. Those rates
in yen have barely budged in the last two years. Unfortunately, the
difference in dollars _ an increase of close to $100 in each case _
will be keenly felt.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since Japan has been considered a
bargain by travelers from anywhere. For many visitors _ and
residents _ it often seems to be the most expensive place on the
planet, what with tiny $5 cups of coffee and taxis whose meters
start at $6.50.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best bargains, though, remains the Japan Rail Pass,
available from the Japan National Tourist Organization offices in
the United States. A one-week pass, which covers wide-ranging tours
of the country aboard Japan's famous bullet trains, is 28,300 yen,
or about $270 at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   In China, the currency is held steady by a government-fixed
exchange rate. Room rates in Beijing have remained fairly stable as
well. Double rooms are available at the China World Hotel in
Beijing for $210, plus 15 percent service and tax charge. Another
central city establishment, the New World Hotel, offers doubles for
$120, including breakfast, service charge and tax.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand, a favorite tourist destination for visitors from
both the West and elsewhere in Asia, prices have been on a slow,
steady rebound since the Asian currency crisis. Compared with
precrisis days, many of the country's top hotels are still a
bargain, but if the current trend continues, that won't be true for
very long.
</P>
<P>
   At the high-end Shangri-La in Bangkok, a double now goes for
$210, including breakfast, laundry and dry cleaning, rising to $290
for a deluxe room. Scarcely three years ago, those rooms were $220
and $310, respectively. In the interim, though, a standard double
had fallen to as little as $180.
</P>
<P>
   And at the legendary Oriental Hotel, the rate is $250 a room,
single or double occupancy, plus 10 percent service charge and 7.7
percent tax, up from $220 two years ago. The Westin Banyan Tree's
doubles are $190, up from about $150 two years ago. And the Delta
Grand Pacific, a popular destination for more-budget-oriented
travelers offers doubles for $85, plus service and tax charges, up
from $75 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For beach vacationers, a week for two at the Club Med Phuket is
$3,200, including three meals a day, drinks and sports activities.
That high-season rate falls to $1,400 for the same package during
the off season. These are the same as two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, the venerable Raffles Hotel says its rates haven't
changed in two years, with a double costing $700, plus 10 percent
service, 1 percent government tax and 1 percent goods and services
tax. A double at the Westin Plaza is also unchanged from 1998:
$360, plus tax.
</P>
<P>
   No country was harder hit by the region's currency collapse than
Indonesia. At the height of the country's woes, deluxe taxis could
be chartered for less than $10 a day, and rooms at the Shangri-La
in Jakarta, with its marble-clad health club, could be had for
under $100.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia remains the region's best bargain. It has gone through
rocky political times with the secession of East Timor and the
recent presidential elections. Indonesia's currency has been rising
slowly, but visitors will find that prices are far below precrisis
levels and still eminently reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   The Shangri-La, for example, offers double rooms for $155, plus
21 percent for tax and service, and doubles can be had at the
Crowne Plaza Jakarta, another top hotel, for a mere $88, with
breakfast included. At the Westin Surabaya, doubles are $63, and
deluxe rooms are $79, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The dream air fare to Asia _ $999 round trip for two people from
the United States to Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific, with five nights'
lodging included _ offered briefly in 1997, may have been the
ultimate deal. But air fare to Asia is still a relative bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Cathay has expanded its $999 round-trip all-Asia pass, which
allows a traveler to visit 16 cities in 30 days; departures from
the United States are from New York, San Francisco or Los Angeles,
with the first and last stop in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet search this month for the lowest air fare from Los
Angeles to Bangkok found $555 on China Airlines and $559 on Korean
Airlines. Continental, Northwest, American and United Airlines all
offered a $638 ticket, just over half of what it was in spring
1997. The best price for a mid-May departure was $680 on Northwest
and Thai.
</P>
<P>
   Not all cities are quite that cheap, though: the lowest Los
Angeles-Tokyo fare for mid-May departure was $811 on Korean Air and
Northwest. The best New York-Tokyo fare for mid-May was $1,161 on
four airlines, which was $200 less than a month earlier.

Reed's lobbying company has a new client: Microsoft. Reed is

share their father,'' Mrs. Pataki, 49, said. (The children are
Emily, 21; Ted, 18; Allison, 15; and George Owen, 12.) ``But there

Hudson County, a densely populated blue-collar area just across the
Hudson from Manhattan, is home to the biggest bloc of Cuban
immigrants outside Dade County, Fla. Union City's mayor, Raul
Garcia, 36, who was born in Cuba but grew up here, said that many

returning. ``I think we'll become chic, sort of a Cuban Hoboken,''
said Garcia, who spoke with a city employee in Garcia's waiting

Laubin, who performed dances of American Plains Indians in the

   (NYT26) SHENYANG, China -- April 10, 2000 -- CHINA-NEIGHBOHRHOOD
-- For urban Chinese who are middle-aged and beyond, the old
``neighborhood committees'' that watched over every household are
among the more obnoxious memories of the early decades of Communist
rule. Now, with experiments in Shenyang and 19 other cities, the

   (NYT25) UNDATED -- April 10, 2000 -- MAGAZINE-ADS-2 -- Toss them
on a desk, and you'll hear what publishers like to refer to as
``the thud factor.'' (The louder the thud! thunk! or boom! the
better.) As the economy continues to thrive, some magazines have
become so fat with advertising that the editorial content is
sometimes relegated to the increasingly hard-to-find nether reaches
of the publication. (Naum Kazhdan/The New York Times)

   (NYT24) UNDATED -- April 10, 2000 -- MAGAZINE-ADS-1 -- In Style,
Vogue, Vanity Fair and W have all in the last year blown past their

people, they might spend their time in a high school auditorium
sweating to the oldies with Richard Simmons. (Naum Kazhdan/The New

   (NYT23) UNDATED -- April 10, 2000 -- IRIDIUM -- The jokes about
the government using the satellites for ``Star Wars'' target
practice don't seem so funny anymore. In the coming months, Iridium
L.L.C., the bankrupt global satellite telephone company, will begin
sending 88 giant satellites, like this one depicted in an artist's

the atmosphere a fitting and fiery end to one of the colossal

right, won many a friend but lost his svelte figure. Then he

months. The craft, NEAR Shoemaker, is taking up a circular orbit 62
miles from the center of the asteroid Eros for more detailed

many ways, ``Fail Safe,'' broadcast live to much of the country on

decades. The B-15 iceberg, shown in an infrared image from March

   (NYT18) NEW YORK -- April 10, 2000 -- TINA-TURNER-REVIEW -- Tina
Turner, 61 and seemingly inexhaustible, ranged across 40 years of
music during a concert at Madison Square Garden on Friday night.
Turner has long since staked out her archetype: the strong, lusty
woman who has grown tougher with every setback and every betrayal.
It's an image that is reinforced by her songs, her autobiography,
her leathery voice and her leonine presence. (Ruth Fremson/The New

Paxton Whitehead and Hayley Mills in ``Shadows of the Evening,''
one of two one-act Noel Coward plays which opened Monday night at
the Lucille Lortel Theater.. The show isn't really a departure from
familiar Coward formulas; it feels instead like a variation on the
stiff-upper-lip sentimentality of his patriotic plays and

hundreds of ushers that once worked Yankee Stadium have steadily
been replaced by beefy security guards over the years. Now there
are eight ushers left, all in their 60s through 80s, and they will
likely become extinct after this season because during
negotiations, the Yankees claimed they could no longer afford to
pay the ushers their $72 a game salary because they needed it for
players salaries. Irwin Schifren, one of the last ushers, during an

   (NYT10) PITTSBURGH -- April 10, 2000 -- SCI-FRUIT-FLY -- The
Drosophila fruit fly, whose genome was just decoded, has attained
vast prominence in human affairs because it is one of the principal
model organisms studied by biologists as a means of understanding
the general design of life. Because of the unity of evolution, the
fly's genes and those of people overlap considerably. From left:

Tourists look over souvenirs in the Valley of Vinales after getting

moon over Havana harbor and its Malecon boulevard. The Hotel
Nacional, left, which opened in 1930, is seen in this view from
atop the Capri Hotel. Forty years of communist rule, along with
four decades of a U.S. economic embargo, have left this gorgeous
island in something of a time warp. While Americans cannot legally
visit the island unless they are journalists, visiting family or on
educational or cultural exchanges, thousands of U.S. visitors are
slipping into Cuba each year by flying to the Bahamas or Mexico and
taking connecting flights. (David Tulis/The Atlanta

helicopter/turboprop, wouldn't die. Congress kept it alive. Now
three of the 15 finished craft have crashed, killing 26 soldiers.
The aircraft remains expensive, experimental and exemplary of the

   BUSH FILLS COMMITTEE POSTS: As part of the inevitably tightening
coordination between the Bush campaign and Republicans nationally,
three Republican officials who have advised Gov. George W. Bush or
raised money for him are moving to the Republican National
Committee. Fred Meyer, a former chairman of the Republican party in
Texas, will be chairman of the committee's Victory 2000 effort; he
will work alongside Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the committee,
to represent the Bush campaign's interests. Maria Cino, who served
as the political director for the Bush campaign, will become the
deputy chairman for political and congressional relations. And
Jeanne Johnson Phillips, a longtime fund-raiser for Bush, will
become deputy chairman for finance.

   McCAIN HELPS CHAFEE: Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., stumped in Rhode
Island on Saturday for Sen. Lincoln Chafee, who is unopposed in the
Republican primary for the seat he gained by appointment after his
father, Sen. John H. Chafee, died in October. The effort was
clearly advantageous to Chafee, as McCain appealed to independent
voters, who make up more than half of Rhode Island's electorate and
who helped him score a Super Tuesday victory in the state. Chafee
will face either Lt. Gov. Richard Licht, who was endorsed by the
state Democratic party last week, or Rep. Bob Weygand, who leads in

   LOS ANGELES INCUMBENT TRAILS: L.A. District Attorney Gil
Garcetti, who has faced harsh criticism for his handling of a
police corruption scandal, is placing a surprisingly distant second
in the race to retain his job, according to a poll published
Monday. A survey by The Los Angeles Times of 2,202 Los Angeles
County residents found that if the election had been held a week
ago, Garcetti would have won only 18 percent of the vote, compared
with 55 percent for his challenger, Steve Cooley, who is a deputy
in the district attorney's office. Twenty-six percent of those
surveyed were undecided.

NFL CASTS SUSPICIOUS GAZE OVER PROSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few in the National Football League can remember a time when so
many league and team executives were so concerned about the actions
of players away from the field.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better example of this than an interview one team
recently had with a player who was expected to be a fifth- or
sixth-round selection at the college draft this weekend. The
21-year-old admitted to smoking marijuana once when he was 15 and
again when he was 18.
</P>
<P>
   The team removed him from its draft board.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question about it: The NFL and its teams are
intensifying their examination of players entering the draft.
</P>
<P>
   This practice is manifesting itself in a number of ways. One is
in the league's background checks of draft-eligible players. Each
year the NFL examines the backgrounds of college prospects, but
according to one owner, the league showed extra caution this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   The league investigated 323 draft-eligible players, checking
criminal records, interviewing law enforcement officials at the
players' colleges, as well as speaking to coaches, friends and even
the players themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Of the players who were checked, 68 of them _ or about one in
five _ had what the league called ``reportable information,''
meaning there was some aspect of the player's background that
raised eyebrows on the league's security staff. The transgressions
ranged from speeding tickets to drug possession, fights, and
violations of National Collegiate Athletic Association rules.
</P>
<P>
   What do the numbers mean? They present a good news-bad news
scenario for the NFL. The good news is that the vast majority of
players coming into the sport from the college ranks have no marks
on their records. So when the draft begins on Saturday at Madison
Square Garden, teams will mostly be stocking up on players without
troubled pasts.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that of those 68 players, some have encountered
serious problems. That means dozens of potential headaches are
entering a sport already reeling from negative headlines about
off-field incidents involving its players, including the former
Carolina Panther Rae Carruth and Baltimore's Ray Lewis, both of
whom have been charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Background checks are not unusual. Each season NFL security
officials do extensive checks on the players' pasts. And it is hard
to compare how 68 players with so-called reportable information
compare to other years, because such information is not normally
made public and thus is not available.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is little doubt that prospects are receiving extra
scrutiny in this draft as part of the league's aggressive attempt
to clean up its image.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL office isn't alone in taking serious precautions when it
comes to drafting college players. An increasing number of
individual teams are combining their security personnel with the
league's resources to insure that nothing is missed. Some teams,
like the Jets, have done this for years, but others are catching
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a list'' said Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin,
referring to its scrutiny of college players with problems. ``We
have always graded heavily for circumstances, and we have a code
that represents a particular player.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if off-field conduct will be a major factor in this week's
draft, Coughlin said: ``No question it will be an issue. That's all
we talked about at the league meetings, over and over and over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials expect fewer teams to take large leaps of faith
with troubled players, as has happened regularly in the past.
Lawrence Phillips, the former St. Louis and Miami running back, had
a history of violence against women while at the University of
Nebraska but he was still a first-round draft pick of the Rams in
1996. If Phillips were coming out of college now with the same
troubles, scouts said, he would not be drafted nearly as high.
</P>
<P>
   One NFC general manager said he knows firsthand of a dozen teams
that have pulled at least five players from their draft boards in
recent days because those players had worrisome backgrounds. ``I
think more players are being crossed off than ever before,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   the Baltimore Ravens' owner, Art Modell, said: ``There is more
emphasis by all teams, I think, to draft players with top
character. And teams are now making sure they get all the
information they can on a player.''
</P>
<P>
   But what will happen when a college player arrives _ and one
will _ who has the talent of Lawrence Taylor but the moral code of
Genghis Khan? Will teams be so sure of themselves then?
</P>
<P>
   They may be forced to, as the NFL continues to study possible
new initiatives and penalties for players who are arrested,
including stronger punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Teams may finally be getting the message: what is the use of
investing millions of dollars in a player who might be suspended
for most of his career because of multiple arrests?
</P>
<P>
   Teams also have another concern: is everyone overreacting?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remember these are kids,'' Modell said. ``A
misdemeanor from a long time ago is not the total picture. We have
to look at the total picture.'' &QL;

`TALK TO ME': BORROWED SITUATIONS BUT SHARP ONE-LINERS
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are a couple of things wrong with Janey Munro, New York
single and heroine of ABC's ``Talk to Me,'' trying to get over her
breakup with her boyfriend ``like a man'' (i.e., having meaningless
casual sex). It's a direct steal from an episode of HBO's ``Sex and
the City,'' in which Sarah Jessica Parker was a lot more
believable.
</P>
<P>
   And when Kyra Sedgwick, the normally likable actress who plays
Janey, bursts into tears in bed with the man she has brazenly,
flirtatiously picked up for the evening, she comes across as a
perfect replica of Alex Forrest, Glenn Close's character in ``Fatal
Attraction.'' Alex was a fine fictional invention but possibly not
the best candidate for her own sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Janey is a successful talk-radio host surrounded by a gaggle of
colorful male colleagues (one heartland-cute and boyish, one
spectacled and British, one sensitive and black) and they all seem
demographically contrived. Beverly D'Angelo's character _ a hostile
Dr. Laura-inspired radio psychiatrist whose tag line is ``Get over
your darned self'' _ is a more original idea, but in the first two
episodes she's a one-note joke.
</P>
<P>
   The show does offer some clever one-liners. Asked what her
possible choices of dresses for a big event are ``saying,'' Janey
responds, ``We are saying, `I'm at the boring advertising party and
I crave the sweet release of death.' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   When a beautiful lesbian explains to her that straight women
aren't as adept as gay ones at kissing, Janey realizes, ``So if I
could bring your powers to my people ... '' But the jokes rarely
soar, maybe because they don't seem to come from character.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception: Nicole Sullivan, who plays Janey's
animal-loving sister, Kat, is fantastically funny. Sullivan, who
comes from Fox's late-night sketch show ``Mad TV,'' plays clueless
innocence with such lovable authenticity that she makes a line like
``It's just that I'm not a one-dog dog'' hysterical; think of her
as the anti-Dharma (as in ``Dharma and Greg''). If a new series can
succeed on the strength of a supporting character (``Will and
Grace'' comes to mind), ``Talk to Me'' may have a chance.  &QL;

PHILIPPINES SET TO VOTE ON PRIVATIZING NATIONAL POWER COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Legislators in the Philippines are set to vote this
week on a bill that would privatize the heavily indebted national
power company, a reform that the International Monetary Fund and
other lenders have demanded before disbursing critical new loans.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives is scheduled to begin voting
Tuesday on the Power Reform Bill, which would liberalize the
Philippine power industry and put the unprofitable, state-run
National Power Corp. into private hands. President Joseph Estrada
and Manuel B. Villar, the House leader, have both pledged support
for the bill, which the Philippine Congress aims to make law by
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has given Manila until June 30 to pass the power bill,
along with the privatization of the Philippines National Bank,
before it releases $500 million in loans needed to help offset the
country's 62.5 billion peso ($1.5 billion) budget deficit. The
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have also made further
lending contingent on the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   This week's vote has also become a test of the credibility of
Estrada's administration, which has shown some of the same
tendencies toward corruption and ineptitude that had characterized
the era of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Action on the power
reform bill has been delayed for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors want to see some tangible evidence that the
government can do something right,'' said Rebecca Patterson, an
analyst at J.P. Morgan in Singapore. If legislators fail to push
the power reform bill through this week, she said, ``it suggests
they can't get anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling the company would also have several tangible benefits,
economists say _ easing electricity prices, which are second only
to Japan's, promoting investment and reducing a sizable burden on
public finances. Government outlays to Napocor, as the money-losing
utility is known, are a major contributor to the Philippines budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   While there is some optimism the House can pass the bill before
next week's Easter recess, there is less hope about the power
bill's fate in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines is not the only country in Southeast Asia where
the IMF is threatening to cut off aid to stimulate economic reform.
In Indonesia last week, the IMF's move to withhold $400 million in
loans spurred the government in Jakarta to expedite economic
changes to keep the money flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine financial markets have been rocked this year by
concerns about creeping cronyism and other forms of corruption.
Fueling those concerns is a scandal over alleged insider trading
involving a friend of Estrada's. The stock exchange's entire
compliance department resigned late last month in protest over what
it called a cover-up of the insider trading affair.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal is overshadowing what economists say is an otherwise
positive economic picture. A trade surplus, low interest rates and
strengthening domestic demand are underpinning an economy that
analysts at Merrill Lynch predict will grow 3.4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Napocor's financial problems are partly the result of the
country's chronic power shortages of the early 1990s. In response
to the brownouts, the company signed contracts with roughly a dozen
independent power producers, who now provide about one-quarter of
the nation's electricity. The contracts overestimated the country's
power demand, however, meaning Napocor has to pay for the power the
country does not need. Worse, most of the power plants use oil for
fuel, leaving the Philippines dependent on petroleum imports for
about half of its power needs.

 &HT;    Iraq clears visit by Ohio official

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Iraqi government has agreed to let U.S. Rep.
Tony Hall visit the country next week to assess a humanitarian
crisis that has festered since the Gulf War of 1990, Hall's office
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Democrat, who has traveled to other crisis points
including Sierra Leone and North Korea, will spend three days
visiting hospitals and other facilities to seek understanding why
aid has been ineffective in stemming malnourishment and other
medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has been under economic sanctions since the war ended,
which some say have thwarted the country's ability to recover from
the devastation of the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Persian Gulf War destroyed much of the country's medical
infrastructure, according to a report by the World Health
Organization. In 1996 the WHO found that much of the population
existed in a state of ``semi starvation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall will be only the second member of Congress to travel in
Iraq since the war, according to Hall's office. The last visitor
was then-U.S. Rep. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who went to help
a pair of U.S. oilmen in diplomatic trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Hall flies to Amman, Jordan, on Friday, where he'll spend the
night before driving to Iraq. Flights are not permitted into Iraq.
Hall is to return to Washington on April 22.

COMPETITION INTENSIFIES IN FAST-MOVING HIGH-TECH REALM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y., Pa.)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As 3Com makes plans to become a much smaller networking
solutions company, shedding several slower-growing operations,
executives have decided to change agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco office of FCB Worldwide, which has handled the
3Com account since the company consolidated agencies in October
1997, is losing the assignment, effective on July 1, to the New
York office of Lowe Lintas &AMP; Partners. FCB San Francisco will
continue as the agency for the Palm computing unit, which is being
spun out of 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   The 3Com account is the first major gain for Lowe Lintas, part
of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, since
the agency was formed last fall by the merger of Lowe &AMP; Partners
Worldwide and Ammirati Puris Lintas.
</P>
<P>
   The 3Com shift is indicative of the ferment among
high-technology marketers as competition intensifies in that
fast-moving, free-spending category. Among others undertaking
reviews are the Compaq Computer Corp.; DirecTV; Lucent
Technologies, for a spinoff that will market voice-technology
products; the Toysrus.com unit of Toys ``R'' Us; and XM Satellite
Radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``3Com is at an interesting transition point,'' Jan Soderstrom,
senior vice president for worldwide marketing and brand management
at the 3Com Corp., said in a telephone interview Monday from Santa
Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of work to make a change,'' she added, ``but it was
really important we had the best partner to communicate a new value
proposition for the brand'' and help ``make the brand a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Ad spending is to be increased by 30 to 40 percent, to $100
million, said Soderstrom, a one-time top marketing executive at
Visa International who joined 3Com in October. The goal is to
introduce in mid- to late June a worldwide campaign, she added, to
promote the 3Com brand as well as product offerings, which will be
pared primarily to broadband and wireless connectivity devices for
consumers and small businesses along with infrastructure equipment
for companies that provide telecommunications and Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to change agencies came after a five-week review
that had been narrowed to FCB San Francisco, Lowe Lintas and two
other agencies, Soderstrom said: Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, part of
the WPP Group; and Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising. BBDO Worldwide, a
unit of the Omnicom Group with which Soderstrom worked when she was
at Visa, withdrew from the review late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Soderstrom said she was attracted to Lowe Lintas because of the
agency's ``proven track record for turning brands around'' like
Heineken, Mercedes-Benz and Sprite, and its reputation for
``integrating work worldwide.'' 3Com plans for the advertising,
direct marketing and other elements of the campaign, which will be
coordinated by the Lowe Lintas office in New York as the lead
agency, to run in its Asian-Pacific, European, Latin American and
United States regional markets.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she chose the New York office of Lowe Lintas rather
than its San Francisco office, which is near 3Com's headquarters in
Santa Clara, Soderstrom replied: ``We wanted to make sure we use
the office with the most depth of resources. We live in a virtual
community here, so it doesn't matter where the agency is.''
</P>
<P>
   Whichever office 3Com chose, Lowe Lintas, which has had what is
widely perceived as a rocky start to its post-merger life, is
pleased to have the assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very, very happy to team up with 3Com,'' said Lee
Garfinkel, chairman and chief creative officer for the U.S.
division of Lowe Lintas. He added that he believed ``if there were
questions about the merger, they were more outside the agency than
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   At FCB San Francisco, part of True North Communications, Geoff
Thompson, chairman and chief executive, said he wished executives
of 3Com well as ``they restructure and downsize their business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focusing our attention now on Palm Inc., the new company
recently spun off from 3Com,'' he added, ``and we're as excited
about the potential of the Palm brand as the market seems to be.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some other consolation Monday for FCB as American
Eagle Outfitters, the retailer of apparel aimed at consumers in
their late teens and early 20s, named an office of the agency to
create its first national television campaign for the
back-to-school shopping season. Billings were estimated by the
daily fax edition of the trade publication Advertising Age at $10
million to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   McElroy FCB in Newport Beach, Calif., part of the FCB Southern
California unit of FCB, was selected for the assignment after a
six-month review, said Michael Leedy, executive vice president for
marketing and e-commerce at American Eagle in Warrendale, Pa. He
declined to identify the three other agencies that had taken part
in the review.
</P>
<P>
   American Eagle, which competes against retailers like
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, has enjoyed sales success with its casual
apparel for young men and women that includes T-shirts, caps and
khaki pants. Other advertising duties for American Eagle, like
print, strategic development and media planning and buying, will
remain in-house.

WELLS FARGO TO BUY FIRST SECURITY OF UTAH 
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Utah, Calif.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. said Monday that it had agreed to buy the
First Security Corp. for $2.9 billion in stock, less than two weeks
after the collapse of First Security's planned merger with Zions
Bancorporation.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will enable Wells Fargo, the nation's seventh-largest
banking company, to build its presence in Utah, one of the
fastest-growing states in the West. First Security is based in Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Wells Fargo, based in San
Francisco, will pay 0.355 share for each share of First Security.
Based on Friday's closing stock prices, the deal values First
Security at $14.11 a share, a 15.8 percent premium.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of First Security gained $1.1875 Monday, to $13.375,
while Wells Fargo slipped 25 cents, to $39.50.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, First Security announced that its 10-month attempt
to merge with Zions, also based in Salt Lake City, had fallen
through. Zions shareholders rejected the deal, largely because
First Security's stock price had fallen sharply since June, with
much of the decline coming after the company issued an earnings
warning in March.
</P>
<P>
   That all-stock deal was valued at $5.9 billion when it was
announced in June 1999 but had declined to about $3.8 billion as
First Security's shares dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the wake of the terminated Zions deal, First Security had
few viable options,'' said Sean Ryan of the research firm
Byrne-Ryan. ``The bank's final conference call with Zions, arguably
the most wanton act of self-immolation since the Buddhist monks
that protested the Vietnam war, decimated management's credibility
and likely scared off most plausible suitors.''
</P>
<P>
   On that March 3 conference call, the banks sought to update
shareholders on the status of the merger in light of First
Security's first-quarter earnings warning announced that day. But
the presence of a lawyer representing Zions on the call bewildered
many analysts and shareholders alike, Ryan said, by periodically
not allowing Zions management to answer questions. That day, First
Security stock dropped 38 percent, while Zions fell 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Wells Fargo has acquired several small banks
with $1 billion to $2 billion in assets. ``This is a bit of a break
for Wells Fargo, but it's just a function of them being
opportunistic,'' Ryan said. ``They are able to get this cratered
franchise on the cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   First Security had $23 billion in assets at the end of last year
and has 333 branches _ 138 in Utah _ and 9,600 employees. It
operates similar to a savings institution, with a business that is
generally weighted toward low-return products like mortgage and car
loans. ``The mortgage business has gotten really crushed in this
rate environment,'' Ryan said. ``But Wells Fargo is one of the top
operators in the mortgage business and is well positioned to
resuscitate First Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would have assets of about $241 billion and
would have operations in 23 states.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is expected to be completed in the second half
of the year, and Wells Fargo said the deal should add to earnings
in the second year of operations. The company will take a charge of
about $375 million for the merger and integration. First Security
expects to take charges for the Zions merger cancellation when its
first-quarter earnings are announced on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy federal regulators, the two banks will sell about
$1.2 billion worth of deposits and associated loans.
</P>
<P>
   First Security has also granted Wells Fargo an option to
purchase authorized but unissued shares of First Security common
stock equal to 19.9 percent of First Security's 206 million shares
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Eccles, chairman and chief executive of First Security,
will likely be elected to the Wells Fargo board, the banks said. &QL;

MCCAIN SAYS MRS. CLINTON CAN BE A STAR
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He is still solidly behind Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
race for the U.S. Senate, but Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., had some
unusually kind words Monday for the mayor's opponent, suggesting
that Hillary Rodham Clinton would be a ``star'' if elected to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in history a first lady has run,''
McCain told students during a visit to Columbia University. ``She
would be a star of the quality that has not been seen since Bobby
Kennedy was elected senator from the state of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the former presidential candidate who campaigned twice
this month in New York on behalf of Giuliani, moved quickly to
clarify his remark. ``I believe she'd be very liberal and I don't
believe she would be good for the country,'' he said, according to
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton still welcomed the initial compliment, her campaign
spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said. ``Hillary appreciates the kind
comparison to Bobby Kennedy and looks forward to working with John
McCain in the Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, speaking at a City Hall Monday afternoon, said he was
not surprised by McCain's remarks. In fact, he said, he agrees with
them. ``I think Senator McCain is correct, but you can be a star
for the wrong reasons,'' the mayor said. ``She would essentially
become a very, very strong advocate for many, many left-wing
causes.''

 &HT;    Uncommitted voters quiz Gore
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANDALIA, Ohio _ Vice President Al Gore took on all comers
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before about 250 uncommitted voters, Gore answered questions for
two hours and tried to grab the political middle in this year's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He said his Republican opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, is
out of sync even with the majority of his own party. Gore touted
his proposed economic and social plans as more moderate and more in
tune with the needs of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe his agenda does not represent the mainstream
of the Republican Party,'' Gore said at Vandalia Butler High
School.
</P>
<P>
   This trip, along with his February visit to Moraine, is the
second to the Miami Valley this year. Today, Gore is to visit an
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was in Cleveland on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, dressed in a golf shirt and slacks, called the night a
public meeting. His stage was the school library. With the tables
having been cleared to accommodate the crowd, he spoke of his
political and personal background for about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The event was called together in less than two days. Local
Democratic planners said Gore campaign officials repeatedly asked
for true independents and not hard-core Gore supporters.
</P>
<P>
   He got a little of both.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob Freels, 18, a Republican and a student at the Miami Valley
Career Tech Center, told Gore that his invitation for weekly
debates with Bush in lieu of paid advertising is self-serving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he just feels more positively speaking to a person
one-on-one,'' Freels said, after speaking privately with Gore after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about restoring decency to the White House, Gore
reiterated his stance that while President Clinton is his friend,
he disagrees with some of his choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm running for president on my own, my own values, my own
beliefs and my own vision for what the presidency is all about,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore drew some hisses from the audience when asked if he would
return for the region's 2003 celebration of the centennial of
powered flight. He was noncommittal, then said he knew North
Carolina was having a shindig, too.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Gore tried to push his administration's track record
and its economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also refined his position on 6-year-old Cuban refugee Elian
Gonzalez. Gore last week seemed to support having the boy stay in
the United States as court proceedings by Miami relatives played
out, even as the boy's father sought to return him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Gore said the boy's best interests should be paramount
and that the decision should be made in a family court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to encourage the talks between the family
members themselves,'' Gore said.

CIGARETTE BILL IS APPROVED BY ASSEMBLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Legislation that would require tobacco companies
to reduce the flammability of cigarettes sold in New York sailed
through the Assembly Monday and is gaining support in the Senate,
where its prospects remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
   If passed, the proposal would make New York the first state to
regulate cigarette sales to help prevent the hundreds of fires
ignited every year by discarded cigarettes. It has passed the
Democratic-led Assembly for four years in a row, but has never come
to a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate. This year, 14 of the
36 Republican senators have signed on as co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fire safety issue, this is not a smoking issue,''
said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Democrat of Manhattan, who
is the main sponsor of the bill. ``It is a cause of human suffering
that we can very simply do something about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has not scheduled a vote on the legislation, although
its main sponsor there, Sen. Frank Padavan of Queens, said he was
confident that one would take place before the end of the session.
``I think we have enough support to get it passed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about 25 percent of fatal residential fires start
when a smoker falls asleep in bed or a lighted cigarette is dropped
on a couch or chair. In New York, such smoking habits have been the
leading cause of fire-related deaths, including 48 deaths in 1997,
according to the state's Office of Fire Prevention and Control.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, commercially sold cigarettes would have to
meet a fire safety standard determined by the Office of Fire
Prevention and Control in consultation with the Health Department.
The standard would include specific criteria, such as a time period
in which an ignited cigarette that is not being smoked would have
to stop burning. Companies could be fined $10,000 for a violation.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has generally resisted such measures,
although in recent years, a handful of less flammable cigarettes
have been introduced, including Virginia Slims, More, and Capri
Light. In January, Philip Morris started testing a new paper in
Merit cigarettes that reduce the amount of oxygen entering the
cigarette, slowing down the rate at which it burns and generates
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan McCormick, a spokesman for Philip Morris, said the
company has been working with federal agencies on the issue and
would oppose state legislation, which he said could lead to
conflicting requirements in different states. ``We think this is an
issue that is best dealt with at the federal level,'' he said.
``Cigarettes are products that are manufactured and distributed
nationally.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Darren Dopp, a spokesman for the state attorney general,
Eliot L. Spitzer, said New York has already adopted fire safety
standards for other consumer products like home building materials
and infant clothing. ``Our review is that there is nothing in state
or federal law that would prohibit this.''
</P>
<P>
   Grannis said tobacco companies have been dragging their feet
because a slower-burning cigarette would allow smokers to re-use
their stubs and take longer to finish their cigarettes. ``The
bottom line is if the cigarette stops burning, then you will have
to relight it, and they won't sell as many cigarettes,'' he said.

INTERNET TAKEOVERS SPUR A BIG SURGE IN ACQUISITIONS IN BRAZIL
</HEADLINE>
  By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Fueled by a flurry of Internet takeovers,
mergers and acquisitions in Brazil surged in the first quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America's largest economy had 65 transactions involving
the acquisition of controlling stakes in medium- to large-sized
companies, or 23 percent more than in the first three months of
last year, according to figures compiled by the Brazilian unit of
KPMG, the consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   A healthier economy provided the backdrop to the increase in
takeover activity, since Brazil was struggling to recover from a
debilitating currency devaluation in the same period last year. But
there is no doubt that a frenzy of dealmaking in the country's
vibrant Internet industry contributed to the growth of mergers and
takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen of the transactions involved Internet companies, up
from three in the first quarter of 1999. Among the foreign firms
involved in this buying spree were PSINet Corp., which acquired two
Internet service providers, and Portugal Telecom, which bought
Zip.net, a portal company, for $365 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a nationalist tendency in Brazil to view
transnational takeovers skeptically,'' said Marcos Moraes, the
founder of Zip.net, who still sits on its board. ``I hope this
nearsightedness will not keep us from trying to bridge the gap
between Brazil and developed countries through the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's Internet industry continues to undergo a rapid
consolidation process, imitating, in a way, the Internet industries
of the United States and other rich nations. Other Brazilian
industries contributed to the increase in takeovers as well, driven
in part by a perception that bigger companies are more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have pointed to Brazil's largest-ever corporate
takeover, Companhia Cervejaria Brahma's $7 billion acquisition of
Companhia Antarctica Paulista, recently approved by antitrust
officials, as a signal of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scale matters, period,'' said Carlos Novis Guimaraes, the head
of Latin American investment banking at Lehman Brothers. ``The
Brahma-Antarctica deal could be played out in sectors that are
still quite fragmented, like banking and insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   One closely watched deal will be the privatization this year of
Banco do Estado de Sao Paulo SA, or Banespa, which has extensive
consumer banking operations in southeastern Brazil. Among the
candidates to buy Banespa is Citigroup, as well as Brazil's largest
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Another big transaction will be the federal government's
privatization of its reinsurance monopoly, IRB-Brasil Resseguros
SA.
</P>
<P>
   Still, concern has emerged over the effect that wide swings in
the Nasdaq and other U.S. markets may have on mergers and
acquisitions in Brazil. On Monday, the Bovespa index for the Sao
Paulo stock exchange fell 4.2 percent, led lower by technology
issues.

MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS INTERVIEW ELIAN'S GREAT-UNCLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ After being stalled for hours Monday by Miami relatives
of Elian Gonzalez, three government-appointed mental health experts
interviewed the boy's great-uncle, bringing U.S. immigration
officials closer to reuniting the 6-year-old with his father and
ending a bitter 4 1/2-month custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials will meet with the mental health experts
Tuesday after they return from Miami to review their evaluations of
Lazaro Gonzalez and Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the boy's father who was
interviewed Sunday, said Maria Cardona, spokeswoman for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   After being advised by the panel, the agency will issue the
Miami relatives instructions on how they must surrender Elian to
U.S. authorities, Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the agency is discussing options to ensure the boy is
returned to his father, who wants to take his son back to Cuba. She
said the relatives will receive the instructions either Tuesday or
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been living with his great-uncle in Miami since his
rescue off the Florida coast near Fort Lauderdale. He was found
floating on an inner tube Thanksgiving Day after an ill-fated boat
journey from Cuba that took the lives of his mother and 10 others.
He was among three survivors on a boat that capsized.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Miami family, who have argued that Elian
deserves his day in court, filed motions with the 11th Judicial
Circuit Court in Miami and U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta on Monday in a desperate attempt to keep the boy in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys have threatened to seek an injunction to keep U.S.
authorities from forcibly removing the boy from the Little Havana
home where he lives with his great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities have sought a peaceful, orderly transfer of
custody and said they have ``bent over backward'' to avert a
showdown at the home, where hundreds of Cuban exiles have held a
round-the-clock vigil and pledged to not give up Elian without a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials are seeking a neutral site for the
transfer of custody, either in Florida or Washington, but not at
the Little Havana home.
</P>
<P>
   Since Elian's rescue, he has been at the center of a political
tug-of-war between supporters who want him to remain in Miami,
primarily from anti-Castro Cuban exiles, and his father, whose
cause has drawn the interest of Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle was interviewed for about an hour by a panel
of two psychiatrists and a psychologist from Washington and New
York late Monday afternoon, 2 1/2 hours after their scheduled
appointment at the University of Miami Jackson Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez had refused to leave the side of his daughter,
Marisleysis, who was hospitalized Saturday in Mercy Hospital for
undisclosed reasons. He had asked the Justice Department on Sunday
to reschedule the meeting to allow his daughter to attend after she
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials decided to continue with the scheduled
meeting. After Gonzalez refused to come to them, Robert Wallis,
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization district director in Miami,
called Mercy Hospital and asked to move the meeting there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was quite rude to keep the doctors waiting,''
Cardona said. ``This is another instance of the government bending
over backwards ... for Elian's well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward A. Rosasco, Mercy Hospital president, said the meeting
was moved to a room near Marisleysis with the ``full permission of
the family.'' He said the mental health experts interviewed
Gonzalez for about an hour with a family attorney, Manny Diaz,
present. After the meeting, Gonzalez and INS officials left the
hospital without issuing a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot speculate on what the conclusion was, there was no
debriefing of the hospital staff,'' Rosasco said. ``It was cordial.
As the meeting broke up ... there was conversation between both
parties as they were leaving the conference room.``
</P>
<P>
   Rosasco said Elian was at the hospital earlier in the day
visiting Marisleysis, who has become a surrogate mother to the boy,
but was not at the hospital when the meeting took place. Attorneys
for Miami relatives have repeatedly asked that Elian undergo a
psychological examination to determine how he would be affected if
he was returned to Cuba with his father. They had their own
psychiatrists examine the boy.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. authorities have contended that the purpose of the
meeting was never to examine the boy or determine how the custody
transfer would affect him. The focus of the meeting was to discuss
how Miami relatives would assist U.S. authorities with the transfer
of custody, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Marisleysis was nearby, Rosasco said, the mental health
experts did not talk to her.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis was first hospitalized last Thursday when she
collapsed after a series of interviews with morning news programs.
At the time, a family spokesman said she had suffered from
exhaustion and stress.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Miami family will now seek relief from state
and federal courts. Over the weekend, attorneys contacted the
emergency duty judge, who relayed the call to 11th Judicial Circuit
Court Judge Jennifer Bailey. Attorneys faxed their motions to the
judge Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   But Bailey stated Sunday that a federal court has already ruled
in the case and that attorneys had yet to show compelling evidence
that the boy will be harmed if he is returned to Cuba, indicating
the attempt by Miami relatives to seek relief in a state court may
be futile.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an estimated 10,000 demonstrators clogged Flagler
Street near the home of Elian's great-uncle in a peaceful prayer
vigil. The demonstration was similar to a prayer vigil held last
week in which thousands gathered in support of the boy.

WALL STREET JOURNAL'S WEB SITE WITHDRAWS MICROSOFT SOURCE CODE
STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a few hours early Monday, The Wall Street
Journal's Web site heralded a scoop: The Microsoft Corp., embroiled
in an antitrust battle, might be forced by the Justice Department
to make the programming code for its Internet Explorer Web browser
available to customers and computer makers. The Reuters news agency
picked up the article, and sent it to its news customers around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But, just as radio stations and others were broadcasting the
news, the Journal removed the report from the Web site. Dick Tofel,
a spokesman for the newspaper, would neither confirm the article's
accuracy, nor give details about why it was removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story was not ready for publication and should not have
been posted,'' was all he would say.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft would not confirm the story either. ``We don't have
any idea what radical remedies the government is kicking around,''
said Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman. ``This idea seems
particularly illogical in that Microsoft already gives away
internet Explorer for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's incident again raises the specter of whether the
pressure to be first with news _ a pressure that has been increased
by the Internet _ is causing journalists to compromise accuracy for
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Many print publications are using their Web sites to get out
news that they feel might be stale by the time their printed pages
are published many hours later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, during the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, both
The Journal and The Dallas Morning News posted articles on their
Web sites offering details about private meetings between Lewinsky
and President Clinton. Both pulled the stories a few hours later,
and published modified versions later on.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft story did not appear in The Wall Street Journal
newspaper which, along with Wall Street Journal Interactive, is
published by Dow Jones &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Although The Journal does have some reporters who write
specifically for the Web site, most of the articles there are
written by the newspaper's staff. The Microsoft piece was written
by John Wilke, a regular Wall Street Journal reporter.

GIULIANI DOES LUNCH TO BOLSTER WOMEN'S SUPPORT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani began a series of statewide
``Women for Rudy'' lunches Monday to reinforce his support among
Republican female voters, a group that has largely remained loyal
as polls show that the mayor's reaction to the shooting of Patrick
Dorismond has caused a drop in his support among men.
</P>
<P>
   At the first lunch, at the Women's National Republican Club in
Midtown Manhattan on Monday, Giuliani received a hero's welcome
from 250 guests, many of whom said that his fight against crime had
made them feel safer and that his economic policies had made them
prosper.
</P>
<P>
   But as he has in the past before similar groups, the mayor made
no specific mention of women's issues. Instead, he delivered his
standard speech about what he considers the Giuliani renaissance of
New York City, and only occasionally alluded to his Senate
opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody that used to run the city,'' Giuliani said to
murmurs of approval, ``and used to run the city with the high crime
rates and the big welfare rates, and used to run the city when it
was called ungovernable, all of those people support my opponent,
right? Every single one of them! They used to run the city, they
support my opponent. What does that tell you about ideas,
ideologies, issues?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we've done something different. We've changed it. Lots of
people don't like that. Lots of people are embarrassed by it. I'm
proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing afterward at City Hall, Giuliani said that he
had deliberately avoided speaking specifically about women. ``I
don't consider women voters different than men voters,'' he said.
``They're the same to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``white voters and black voters are the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, Russian Orthodox, outside of
Russia, Muslim voters,'' he said, ``they're all the same to me.''
</P>
<P>
   His approach, he said, had helped move the city away from its
emphasis on ``vast and intricate subcultures.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clear reference to Clinton, he added that women support him
because ``they don't feel that I have some kind of pandering group
of views that say, `Oh, gee, you know in front of a white audience
I'm going to say one thing, in front of a black audience I'm going
to say another thing, in front of a women's audience I'm going to
say a third thing.'''

   Clinton, who leads the mayor 49 percent to 41 percent in a New
York Times/CBS News poll of 1,573 respondents conducted this month,
also leads among women overall, with 52 percent to the mayor's 38
percent. Her support among women is statistically unchanged from a
similar Times/CBS News poll conducted in February, before the
police shooting of Dorismond, when Clinton led Giuliani among women
voters, 50 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll showed that Giuliani's support among men had
dropped in the same time period. In February, Giuliani led Clinton
among men over all, 54 percent to 37 percent. By April, it was
Clinton who was leading among men, 46 percent to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that one of the mayor's biggest declines in
support was among independent men, who supported him, 62 percent to
26 percent, over Clinton in February. By April, they were
supporting him by 47 percent to 32 percent, a net drop of 15
points.

<P>
   At Monday's lunch, a number of guests characterized Giuliani's
attacks on Dorismond as merely impolitic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps his choice of words wasn't clear,'' said Jennifer
Duncan, 31, a Republican from Rocky Point, on Long Island, who
works as a hotel catering manager in Manhattan. ``Just listen to
him. He's an intelligent man. He certainly wouldn't want an
innocent gentleman killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said that the mayor's record on crime was his most
attractive attribute. ``I was mugged when I first came to
Manhattan, and it's a much safer city because of him,'' said Carol
Nobbs, 53, a real estate broker and a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's criticism of Dorismond, she said, did not bother her.
``He was defending himself,'' she said of the mayor. ``Which he has
a right to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Giuliani is to attend a ``Women for Rudy'' lunch in
Rochester and then what his advisers are calling a ``women's town
hall meeting'' in Buffalo. On Thursday, Giuliani is to attend a
``Women for Rudy'' lunch in Mineola, on Long Island.  &QL;

 &HT;    Cuban-Americans show busloads of support in losing battle
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Resignation showed in the faces of thousands of
Cuban-Americans as they made a last-ditch show of support Monday in
their losing battle to keep 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Among those rallying near the home where Elian is staying with
his Miami relatives were about 100 Cuban exiles from Palm Beach
County who came in two chartered buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely not a celebration,'' said Jorge Avellana,
one of the organizers of the caravan that left Monday afternoon
from the Cuban-American Club in suburban West Palm Beach. ``The
real loser of this battle is the American system of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Elian may have only a few more days before he's removed
from the Miami home where he has lived for the past four months,
those on the bus caravan said they felt it was important to show
support for his cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be going to Cuba no matter what, but we need to show
the world that we don't agree with that,'' said Duny Falero of
Greenacres, who rode the bus with her 11-year-old son. Falero said
it was her first protest as a Cuban-American.
</P>
<P>
   The bus trip was organized by a coalition of 15 political,
veteran and social groups in Palm Beach County, but many of those
who boarded said they don't belong to any of the groups. Some said
they heard coalition spokesman Ernesto Priede of West Palm Beach
speaking on a Miami radio station asking people to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Most said they were drawn to the battle not because of their
hatred of Fidel Castro, but because the federal government was not
allowing Elian's Miami family to petition in family court to settle
the custody question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going to happen with Elian, but I'm here
because I believe it's an injustice,'' said Ana Lopez, a West Palm
Beach resident who said she left Cuba 39 years ago. ``As an
American, I stand for what I believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Her shoulders draped in a Cuban flag, Delia Garcia-Menocal of
Wellington stood a few blocks from Elian's home, listening as
religious leaders led the crowd in prayers for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a child of the world,'' said Garcia-Menocal, a great
niece of Mario Garcia-Menocal, who served as Cuba's president from
1912-20. ``He doesn't belong to a dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   Priede said the newly formed coalition, called the Cuban
Patriotic Coalition of Palm Beach County, was formed in January
after the federal government took the position that Elian must be
reunited with this father and returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be a permanent group to deal with whatever
issues arise about Cuba,'' he said.

PERUVIAN INCUMBENT'S LEAD IN VOTE PROMPTS ACCUSATIONS OF FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite and expand by 450 words; updates percentages in
4th graf; reports on Fujimori's news conference; adds 2nd take of
new material.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Official returns Monday showed President Alberto K.
Fujimori approaching a first-round victory in Peru's presidential
election, prompting cries of fraud and threats of civil
disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Sunday's voting, polls of voters and independent
counts suggested that neither Fujimori, running for a third
five-year term, nor his challenger, Alejandro Toledo, would garner
a majority.
</P>
<P>
   That situation would have led to a second-round ballot that
foreign diplomats and election monitors hoped would avoid the
irregularities and dirty tricks that election monitors said
accompanied the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But with 56.4 percent of the vote counted, the National Election
Office said Monday night that Fujimori had received 49.6 percent to
Toledo's 40.6. Fujimori's closeness to an outright majority,
coupled with unexplained delays of up to several hours in getting
ballot boxes and tally sheets to computer centers, led to
suspicions of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The ballots have already been destroyed, as allowed by Peruvian
law.
</P>
<P>
   It still appears likely that Fujimori's alliance, Peru 2000,
will lose control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When the first accusations of counting irregularities surfaced
just before midnight on Sunday, Toledo led tens of thousands of
protesters on a march to the presidential palace, where they were
driven back by policemen using tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters carried Toledo on their shoulders, then threw tear
gas canisters back at the police and at the palace itself,
chanting, ``The fear is gone!''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said Monday that the election results should be annulled.
``The quantity and seriousness of the irregularities _ from the
ballots to the counting centers _ have led us to the conclusion not
to recognize the results,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a business-school professor trained in the United
States, has never held high public office. But during his long-shot
campaign he demonstrated a knack for timing and an ability to
motivate energetic support, especially from working class people.
</P>
<P>
   He and his supporters are now threatening a long civil
disobedience campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign election monitors expressed particular concern over the
delays in getting tally sheets and ballots to counting centers.
Some arrived as many as seven hours after polls had closed, even in
cities like Lima and Arequipa, where there was no reason for such
delays.
</P>
<P>
   The head of an observer team from the Organization of American
States, Eduardo Stein, also said he could not understand why dozens
of government computer centers were shut down through Sunday night
and most of Monday, when they were supposed to be open and tallying
ballots. He said he could not ascertain how the government was
coming to its official count, or where the count was taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried,'' said Stein, a former foreign minister of
Guatemala. ``All the signals we got yesterday evening were
disquieting because there was a big and inexplicable delay in the
transportation of the vote tabulation sheets and the ballot boxes
to the computer counting centers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something sinister is happening here,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori rejected charges of fraud in a news conference Monday
night, saying the vote was ``totally normal and just.'' He added
that ``a few problems happen in all elections.'' He said he could
not declare victory until final results were in.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the seven other opposition candidates have joined Toledo
in criticizing the government's handling of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo surged in the final weeks of the campaign because of
growing dissent over reports of campaign irregularities in the
Fujimori camp. With his strong Indian features, he was able to tap
into deep chords of social discontent in the urban masses who are
largely of mixed Indian and Latino blood.
</P>
<P>
   A Fujimori victory of questionable fairness would put the United
States and the Organization of American States in a difficult
position. They would have to decide whether to accept the results
or retract recognition of the Fujimori government and levy
sanctions until new elections are called.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, when the election had appeared headed for a
runoff, the State Department urged the Peruvian government ``to
take every possible measure to ensure that the next round of voting
fully meets democratic standards of openness, transparency and
fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The legitimacy of the next president is at stake,'' James P.
Rubin, the department's spokesman, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has long been a key ally of the United States in
fighting international narcotics trafficking, and is seen as a
strong leader who can prevent the kind of guerrilla turbulence that
afflicts neighboring Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   But since Sunday's voting, there have been assorted reports to
election monitors that convicts voted, that ballots were tampered
with to remove Toledo's name, that people were paid to vote for
Fujimori and that police and army officials harassed election
monitors of opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   According to election observers, the vote tally sheets, which
were scheduled to be delivered by 9 p.m. to the computer centers,
did not reach the centers until between 4 and 5 in the morning. The
delays were nationwide and appeared to be systematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This process has been contaminated,'' said Rafael Roncagliolo,
a director of Transparencia, a private group that is monitoring the
election and is largely financed by the United States government.
``If they avert a second round, we can only conclude that they have
had a long-term plan for fraud all along.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick count of vote tally sheets by Transparencia on Sunday
night showed that Fujimori had won 48.7 percent of the vote.
Monday, Transparencia officials said that if anything, that tally
overestimated Fujimori's strength. A quick count by the
Organization of American States of separate vote tally sheets came
to a similar conclusion that a second round would be held.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Transparencia count, the State Department in
Washington said Monday, ``Reliable sampling of actual election
returns revealed that no single candidate won an absolute majority
and that there will be a runoff between President Alberto Fujimori
and opposition candidate Alejandro Toledo.''
</P>
<P>
   Election officials said their latest tallies did not include
votes from the most remote jungle and Andean Indian villages, where
in the past Fujimori has been strongest and where election monitors
say the chances for fraud are greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Portillo, the top Peruvian election authority, told
reporters Monday that there were no computing problems and that ``a
very rigorous effort'' was being made to ensure an accurate count.
``A Dutch observer asked me why there were so many safeguards,'' he
added, ``and I responded that we are very careful people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have long criticized Fujimori's
strong-arm ways, particularly when his supporters dismissed three
judges who opposed his bid for a third consecutive term, based on
the 1993 constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was also strongly critical of the repression
of independent media during the campaign, as well as smear
campaigns against opposition candidates thought to be designed by
Fujimori's intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Peruvian president has been a strong United States
ally on security matters, and he has been credited with defeating
two Marxist terrorist insurgencies and making peace with Ecuador
after more than a century of border conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The American ambassador, John Hamilton, made it clear to senior
Peruvian officials Monday that a rigged election would put
relations with Peru under the most serious pressure. He has also
been talking repeatedly with Toledo, who can be impetuous and
heated in his statements, urging him to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   How the diplomatic reactions play out is likely to have an
impact on nearby Venezuela, where President Hugo Chavez is facing
increasing opposition in May presidential elections. Chavez, who
once led an army coup attempt, is a known admirer of Fujimori's and
has radically remade the nation's democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Observers in Peru said no similar delays in transporting ballot
boxes and tally sheets occurred in 1995, when Fujimori won nearly
two-thirds of the vote according to the official count.
</P>
<P>
   The election authorities were supposed to release 30 percent of
the vote count late Sunday night, and a rough unofficial count of
the complete results by midmorning Monday. But so far, election
officials said it would take at least 48 hours to come up with an
official total vote.

PHILIP MORRIS FINED FOR ETHICS VIOLATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Five months after New York state fined Philip
Morris and imposed a three-year ban against its chief Albany
lobbyist for violating the state's lobbying laws, Connecticut's
Ethics Commission announced Monday that it had taken similar action
against the same tobacco company and lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement signed last Wednesday by Philip Morris and
its lobbyist, Sharon T. Portnoy, the company agreed to pay a
$20,000 penalty, and Portnoy was to pay $4,000 and abide by a
one-year ban from lobbying Connecticut lawmakers. Portnoy is the
first lobbyist in Connecticut to be banned for violating the
state's comparatively strict ethical guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In November, after an investigation by New York's state ethics
commission, Philip Morris paid the state a $75,000 fine, and
Portnoy paid a $15,000 fine and was barred from lobbying in Albany
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's penalty against Philip Morris was imposed
primarily because the company failed to itemize properly and fully
report money it paid to Portnoy and its top Connecticut lobbyists,
Clem Roy and Craig LeRoy, a high-level aide to Gov. John G. Rowland
from 1997 to 1999. The company has said its violations were not
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   Portnoy's punishment was primarily for falsifying the amount she
spent on five meals for three Connecticut lawmakers during
out-of-state conferences in Philadelphia, Honolulu and San Antonio
in 1997 and 1998, said Brenda M. Bergeron, an Ethics Commission
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three lawmakers violated any state lobbying laws,
though Portnoy misled them about how much their meals cost, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for example, Portnoy reported paying $122 for two
dinners she bought for state Rep. Hector A. Diaz, D-Bridgeport, at
Deux Cheminees, a restaurant in Philadelphia, and Bali by the Sea,
in Hawaii. But the two meals actually cost $186.06, in excess of
the $150 annual limit the state allowed lobbyists to spend on
lawmakers in 1997, Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in 1998, Portnoy reported paying $72.37 for a meal
for Rep. Minnie Gonzalez, D-Hartford, at Mansion del Rio, a
restaurant in San Antonio, even though the bill was actually
$84.43. That same year, Portnoy reported paying $145.57 for two
meals for Rep. John S. Martinez, D-New Haven, even though both cost
$185.09.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the state lowered the annual amount a lawmaker could
accept in meals from lobbyists to $50 from $150, and Gonzalez and
Martinez paid back the amount Portnoy told them they owed, Bergeron
said, to stay under those limits.
</P>
<P>
   Alan S. Plofsky, the Ethics Commission's executive director,
said Portnoy was not aware that she was violating the law.

SUNDAY BEST? ON TV, IT'S THE
 NIGHT OF NIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service

 BY BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - Remember NBC's glory days of Must-See TV, the
Thursday nights when ``Seinfeld'' and ``ER'' held television
viewers in the net work's iron grip?
</P>
<P>
   Of course you do if you so much as channel-surfed past the
Peacock Network, you caught an ad for it. We're still feeling the
fallout from one of the best marketing gimmicks television has ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   But five years later, how does that lineup hold up?
</P>
<P>
   Not all that well actually. Certainly not as well as TV's
traditional Holy Grail, CBS' 1973 Saturday-night lineup, with its
roster of such non-stop legends as Archie Bunker, Mary Tyler Moore
and Bob Newhart.
</P>
<P>
   That's no surprise we always remember TV as being better way
back when. (If only Steve Allen still hosted ``The Tonight Show'' _
wait, bad example.)
</P>
<P>
   What may shock you is this: Sunday night current Sundays, right
here, right now may be the best lineup of the lot, maybe the best
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it takes a little fudging (more on that later), but
nostalgic types need to yank their heads out of the sand and quit
moaning about how good TV used to be. Because, for one night
anyway, it's better than it ever was.
</P>
<P>
   But first, those Thursdays. In 1995, NBC's comedy heyday, here's
what we saw: ``Friends,'' ``The Single Guy,'' ``Seinfeld,''
``Caroline in the City'' and ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Swap ``Suddenly Susan'' for ``Caro line in the City'' and you've
got 1996's lineup, a change that hardly matters. And that's the
problem if this were truly a powerhouse, it would.
</P>
<P>
   But Must-See TV was, more than anything else, a network gimmick,
not a valid description. For proof, look how NBC has expanded it's
Must-See umbrella, says Robert Thompson, director of the Center for
the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, to include
dogs like ``Battery Park.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quickly you realize that this is Must-See TV simply because
NBC says it is Must-See TV,'' Thompson says. ``It's like McDonald's
calling the Big Mac a must-eat hamburger. `Says who?' is the
ultimate response one has to give to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't exactly electronic snake oil NBC was selling.
``Friends'' and ``ER,'' along with ``Frasier'' (which slipped into
``Sein fel''d's slot), still draw enough view ers to make hits out
of would-be road kill like ``Stark Raving Mad,'' the same way the
old lineup bailed out disasters like ``Suddenly Susan,'' which
promptly tanked when moved from its cushy spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday is one of the few nights that the old-fashioned
network way of watching television remains,'' Thompson says. ``You
put it on at (7 o'clock) and you leave it on one channel till you
go to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was, of course, the way we watched television in 1973,
when there were only three networks and CBS' Saturday-night lineup
went like this: ``All in the Family,'' ``MASH,'' ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show,'' ``The Bob Newhart Show'' and ``The Carol Burnett
Show.'' Hey, I was only 10, and I knew even then that this was some
thing special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carol Burnett'' was simply very good; each of the other shows
broke some kind of ground, either bringing a newfound realism to
the sitcom (``All in the Family,'' ``MAS''H), exploring new
territory (Moore's reluctant feminist) or reveling in mainstream
hip swagger (``Newhart'' _ for the time).
</P>
<P>
   And yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As groundbreaking as that Satur day night was in a real,
actual assessment, I don't know,'' Thomp son says. ``You put ``The
Simpsons'' against ``All in the Family,'' ``Mary Tyler Moore'' and
``Bob Newhart,'' and I'd have to put ``The Simpsons'' on top. ``The
Simpsons'' is arguably the greatest comedy that's ever been on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Not arguable here _ it's the best, hands down. And it just kicks
off current Sunday nights. From there, it's ``Malcolm in the
Middle,'' ``The X-Files,'' ``The Practice'' and ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I know that's three different networks and one of them
cable. But let's face it, we live in a different TV universe now,
with remotes as com mon as the thumbs that punch them and hundreds
of channels to choose from. Times have changed _ a lot, even since
1995 _ and so have the requirements for great nights of television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology has allowed everyone now to program their own
evenings of television,'' Thompson says. Bet ter, more-varied
nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm'' is hilarious, and even if ``The X-Files'' isn't the
show it once was, it's still better than most of what's out there,
no pun intended (well, maybe a little). Thompson says he thinks
that if ``The Practice'' had appeared before 1981, when ``Hill
Street Blues'' changed the blueprint for TV drama, it would be
``the best drama on the medium ever.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't quite buy that, but I'll agree it's a good show. And
what better way to end a night of quality viewing than the sublime
``Sopranos'' (the show I'd give Thompson's superla tive to)?
</P>
<P>
   All the night lacks is a catchy slogan. Come to think of it,
it's just fine without one.

WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH DI

<P>
   (Undated) - ABC's news stars are apparently all in a tizzy over
Leonardo DiCaprio's ``interview'' with Bill Clinton last week.
Interview _ that's what the White House says ABC requested. ABC,
meanwhile, says it asked for a ``walk-through.'' Whatever the case,
DiCaprio ended up sitting down with the president and asking him
questions as part of a planned ABC special about Earth Day (the
segment may or may not air).
</P>
<P>
   So now news hounds like Sam Donaldson reportedly are furious. My
question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   Does DiCaprio's whatever-you-want-to-call-it blur the line
between jour nalism and entertainment? Sure. So does Donaldson's
pit-bull act on his Sunday morning talk show. So does the screaming
match that is ``Cross fire,'' on CNN. So does Diane Sawyer standing
on her head while interviewing Elian Gonzalez. So does sending the
local weatherman to milk goats at the county fair while he's
telling us there is a 10 percent chance of rain.
</P>
<P>
   The line between TV news and entertainment is increasingly
fuzzy, which is a legitimate problem. For anyone who contributes to
it to complain about DiCaprio's whatcha macalit is hypocrisy of,
say, ``Ti tanic'' proportions. &QL;
</P>

Detec tive Jill Kirkendall, is leavingthe show at the end of the

<P>
   Sort of ironic, since all the newscast ers I've ever seen act
like they want to be TV stars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bad news for fans of ``Secret Agent Man,'' all two or three of

<P>
   Fans of ``Roswell,'' which returns to Channel 61 Monday at 8

<P>
   You settle down in front of the tube Sunday night, watch ``The
Practice'' and once it's over switch to HBO for ``The Sopranos''
the perfect TV nightcap. Only when you change channels the show is
ending. What?!
</P>
<P>
   And then it hits you Daylight Saving Time kicked in all over the
rest of the country, and HBO's schedule changed accordingly. You
moron!
</P>
<P>
   At least that's how I felt last Sunday. So make sure you check
``The Republic's'' TV book when you're looking for a cable show. Of
course, that won't solve the biggest problem
</P>
<P>
   choosing between ``The Practice'' and ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Might be time to learn that trick with the VCR where you
tape one show and watch another. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Friday, a crowd packed the sidewalk waiting for
the 10 a.m. opening of H&AMP;M, a purveyor of cheap chic that is
Manhattan's latest temple to consumerism. Held back by velvet
ropes, as if at a nightclub, customers were squeezed shoulder to
shoulder. The instant the portals swung open, they rushed the
racks, snatching up $9 tank tops, $30 dresses and $19 drawstring
pants _ the fashion equivalent of fast food, in both price and
trendiness.
</P>
<P>
   Many failed to notice that it was soon well past the hour when
more conscientious New Yorkers are at their desks. ``I'm supposed
to be at an audition right now, and I have to catch a plane at 1,''
said Becky Bahling, 22, an actress. But the prospect of missed
flights and squandered opportunities seemed not to faze her. ``I
want this and I want it now,'' she said, slipping on a
caramel-colored leather coat that cost $170.
</P>
<P>
   On another day last week, Diego Del Pino, 26, a Web site
designer for Sothebys.com, was making his third visit to the store
since its opening on March 31. He plucked out a pair of $39.99
trousers to match a $69.99 gray linen sport coat. ``Before I came
here, I used to shop at the Gap and Banana Republic,'' he said.
``But lately those stores have been so boring. The design just
isn't there.'' As for prices, he said, ``Well, compared to almost
anywhere, this place is heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the throngs descending on H&AMP;M, on Fifth Avenue at
51st Street, many shoppers do regard it as a retail Nirvana. On
Saturday there was a 25-minute wait for one of the unisex dressing
rooms, and customers were changing in the aisles. A woman demanded
a paisley skirt from a mannequin when the racks were emptied. At
peak hours, the store restocks from garment racks on the sidewalks
and trucks waiting in the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``People told us that New Yorkers didn't line up to come into
stores,'' said Par Darj, director of U.S. operations for H&AMP;M, a
Stockholm-based chain with 700 stores in 12 European countries.
``How did this happen? We're very surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   So are retail experts. ``They're able to translate forward
fashion quickly at value prices, and at least in the first few
days, they have been very successful,'' said Arnold Aronson,
managing director of retail strategies for Kurt Salmon Associates,
a retail consulting firm. ``I've seen consumers walking out not
with onesies and twosies, but with dozens of garments. If the store
can make adequate margins to satisfy their profit needs, then
they've got something very relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   The press of shoppers is all the more remarkable considering
that only a month ago, few New Yorkers had heard of H&AMP;M, or Hennes
&AMP; Mauritz, as it is formally known. But on the strength of a
last-minute flurry of advertisements featuring the actress Chloe
Sevigny and enthusiastic word of mouth, the store has succeeded,
for the moment at least, in pumping consumers' adrenalin levels to
dizzying heights. Darj said 2,000 shoppers rushed into the
35,000-square-foot store the first 13 minutes it was open.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;M arrives at a time when consumer shopping patterns have
changed markedly in the United States. Ever on the prowl for
bargains, and made cynical by frequent store markdowns and
promotions, even many affluent customers have deserted department
stores. They shop instead at discounters like Target and outlet
centers like Woodbury Common in Central Valley, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's chic to pay less,'' said Howard L. Davidowitz, a New York
retail analyst. ``More now than it ever has been.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of chains like Old Navy has shown that even in an
economic boom, customers will flock to retailers offering deep
discounts. But while Old Navy sells basics like T-shirts and cargo
shorts, H&AMP;M's formula is to offer much hipper fashion at
rock-bottom prices. With most items priced well below $100, even
the occasional cheap-feeling fabric or frayed hem isn't turning off
shoppers intent on getting the latest Helmut Lang or Prada
look-alike. The clothes are for the most part a synthesis of
current runway fashion and street styles: fringed and embroidered
hippie chic, lots of leather, uptown ladylike clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Margareta van den Bosch, H&AMP;M's chief designer, maintained that
her 70-member team, which designs under 23 labels for men, women
and children, was not creating knockoffs. ``Of course we follow
fashion,'' she said. ``We have invested quite a lot in that. But we
want to do things our own way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, urban shoppers on the prowl for cutting-edge
style at deep discounts had to wait for sales at midprice apparel
chains like Zara, Club Monaco or Scoop, or ferret out deals amid
the bedding and barbecue grills at Kmart and Target. H&AMP;M stores
cater to young-minded patrons who prefer to shop guilt-free for
fashion that can be discarded after only a season or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming in at a level between Target and the department
stores,'' said Candace Corlett, a partner at WSL Retail Strategies,
a retail consultant. ``It certainly has the competition sitting up
and taking notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Stores like Lerner New York, the Limited Express and
Bloomingdale's, which might be most directly affected if H&AMP;M sets
off a price war, seem to have a wary eye on the newcomer.
Bloomingdale's ran ads last week linking style and value in what
seemed an obvious attempt to compete.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lerner New York, Philip Monaghan, said there
were so few stores selling truly stylish clothes at ultralow prices
that the arrival of H&AMP;M would not set off a price war. ``I don't
think we're going to feel the impact from H&AMP;M,'' he said. ``They're
not in the malls of America yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But H&AMP;M intends to be there. Days after opening on Fifth Avenue,
the chain opened a second 35,000-square-foot store at the Palisades
Mall in West Nyack, N.Y. And on Thursday, it will open a third at
the Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J. There are also plans for a
40,000-square-foot store on West 34th Street, around the corner
from Macy's, and a store on Lexington Avenue in the former
Alexander's location. Retail analysts estimate that the chain plans
100 stores nationwide.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But some experts said they doubted H&AMP;M could sustain such
aggressive expansion, speculating that profits would suffer. ``H&AMP;M
appears to be doing a large number of transactions,'' said Richard
B. Hodos, the president of HGCD Retail Service, a retail consulting
and brokerage firm. ``But it would be interesting to see the
average dollar amount that they are ringing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Darj declined to cite revenue figures for the store's first
week, or to specify how much H&AMP;M had to sell to be profitable. But
he did say the numbers were ``well beyond our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts questioned whether the notion of ``disposable
chic'' would ultimately prove distasteful to customers. ``It's the
kind of merchandise we used to call flash and trash,'' said Richard
Jaffee, a retail analyst at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   But Jaffe praised what he called the store's energy level: its
mix of shoppers, young and old, hip and fashion-clueless, and the
amount of socializing that goes on while customers shop. ``The
store is positioned to generate the same kind of excitement we used
to see on the main floor of Bloomingdale's 20 years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Mattie Ullrich, 26, a movie costume designer, was
weighed down by her haul, which included a plaid skirt ($25) and a
tiger-print tank top ($17). ``This is fun,'' she said, teetering
toward a register. Holding up a sleeveless bead-embroidered
sweater, she said, ``I love this top.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only bummer,'' she added, ``is that by this time next week
everyone else in New York will have it, too.''

U.S. OFFICIALS PLEDGE FUNDS FOR PROJECTS ALONG HUDSON
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ In an effort to revive ailing towns and
preserve farms along the Hudson River, federal housing and
agriculture officials said Monday that they would focus more than
$50 million in loans and grants over the next two years on projects
that spur the region's economy while improving its environment.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to most federal offers of money for development
aimed at solving a local problem, the effort would give preference
to projects whose impact spans several municipalities or counties,
said Andrew M. Cuomo, the housing secretary, at a meeting of about
150 officials and business owners from the area.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, he said, is to use the competition for aid to spur
cooperative planning in a state where local governments usually act
independently _ and often at cross purposes. ``If you want to win,
you must come up with a regional plan which gets outside of your
boundaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said he hoped the valley would follow the path already
taken by several other parts of the country that have shifted to a
regional strategy for economic growth, including western Kentucky
and the Research Triangle Park area of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson River project is modeled on a similar 1997 effort for
communities along the Erie Canal that used federal money to
encourage tourism and new businesses, Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a 1999 Cornell University study that showed that the
Canal Corridor Initiative, as the previous effort was called, had
so far funneled $400 million in federal loans and grants to
communities along the 524-mile waterway, while generating an equal
amount of private investment and creating twice as many jobs as had
been initially predicted.
</P>
<P>
   As they outlined the Hudson Valley plan, Cuomo and Dan Glickman,
agriculture secretary, were flanked by New York members of Congress
from both political parties, including Sen. Charles E. Schumer, a
Democrat, and Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, a Republican whose district
stretches from the suburbs of Westchester to the Borscht Belt in
the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman predicted that communities around the valley would find
ways to take advantage of the program. Cuomo cited recent surveys
of New York's economy showing that most of the Hudson Valley had
not shared in the protracted economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, federal surveys of wages showed that from
1990 to 1997, while the average weekly wage in the state rose 9
percent to $467 from $424, the average weekly paycheck for the rest
of the Hudson Valley fell to $355 from $361.
</P>
<P>
   The project outlined Monday included a variety of grants and
loans aimed at both urban renewal and rural preservation around the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Up to $20 million in grants from the housing agency will be
doled out over the next two years for proposals that foster
regional planning, Cuomo said. The deadline for proposals is May
24, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Housing officials said recent examples of federally supported
local projects that had had broadly beneficial impact were a park,
museum and marinas along the Erie Canal, which created a network of
stopping points for boaters, and an existing proposal for a ferry
linking Ossining and Haverstraw, which sit on opposite sides of the
lower Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The grants can be sought by communities across the country,
Cuomo said, but he added that the Hudson Valley was one of only a
few areas where several municipalities could easily create a
suitable project with shared benefits.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a recent economic partnership between Kingston and
Newburgh, two Hudson River cities that faced high unemployment and
loss of industry, as an example of the kind of collaboration the
agency was seeking to support.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate but coordinated effort, the agriculture department
is offering $30 million over the next two years to projects up and
down the valley that help sustain the farming economy, Glickman
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the housing agency is offering loans for business
development that could bring the total targeted support for the
region to $80 million, Cuomo said.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The United States is largely to blame for the
suffering of Afghan women under the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
   It was U.S. action that brought the Taliban to power, and the
Taliban could be removed if the United States and the United
Nations had the will to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the opinions of activists working to help the women.
Since the Taliban militia captured Kabul in 1996, girls have been
prevented from attending school. Women lost their jobs as doctors,
lawyers, teachers and government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Women are under virtual house arrest, prohibited from leaving
their homes unless they're accompanied by a male relative. This
rule is especially hard on the 300,000 wid ows in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When women do go outside, they must be covered from head to toe
with a shroud with only a small piece of mesh over the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They can be beaten for showing an ankle. They lack health care
because male doctors are forbidden from treating women patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, activists lobbied for sup port of Afghan women at
Feminist Expo 2000, an international gather ing of women's rights
advocates in Baltimore that drew about 6,000 women and men from
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the convention was Zieba Shorish-Shamley,
director of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in
Afghanistan. She criticizes the United States for aban doning
Afghanistan after the Soviets ended their occupation in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Russia withdrew, the U.S. lost interest, and that's the
time we needed the U.S. the most,'' Shorish-Shamley said ``That's
when foreign, neighboring countries (such as Paki stan), each with
their own interest, moved in and started supporting different
factions.''
</P>
<P>
   She's angry that the CIA supported the rebels during Soviet
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban _ Pakistan trained it; Saudi Arabia financed it;
and the U.S. blessed it,''Shorish-Stamley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cash, arms, food and medicine for the rebels were channeled from
the United States through the Pakistani intelligence service, said
Philip Smith, director of research and analysis for a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank, the Center for Public Policy Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was staff director for the Congressional Task Force on Af
ghanist an from 1988 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We more or less deferred to them (Pakistani intelligence), and
that was a big mistake,'' Smith said. ``U.S. policy changed
dramatically when bombs went off (at U.S. embassies in 1998) in Dar
es Salaam as well as Nairobi. At that point, I think policymakers
smelled the coffee. Prior to that, they often looked the other way
when fundamentalists were seizing control of Afghani stan.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States blamed Osama Bin Laden for the embassy
bombings and retaliated by bombing what it said was a chemical
factory in the Sudan and three training camps of Bin Laden's in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Clinton administration is prepared to bomb Afghanistan
over Bin Laden, why don't we start pushing the international
community (on behalf of Afghan women)?? asked T. Kuman, an
executive with Amnesty international.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't the U.S. and other countries put pressure on the
three countries that recognize the Taliban _ Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates?''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has become more interested in Afghanistan
because of the oil and gas in former Soviet republics,
Shorish-Shamley said.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Unocal joined a consortium with oil companies
from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia with the idea of building a pipeline
from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan to Pakistan. Unocal dropped
out in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Leno, activist and wife of comedian Jay Leno, wants the
United States to pressure Pakistan to stop supporting the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it clear to our governments that for the rest of their
lives, every time they look in the rear-view mirror, they'll see
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, governments and busi nesses should pressure the
Taliban the way they pressured South Africa to end racial
apartheid, said Deb Ellis, author of the soon-to-be-pub lished book
``Women of the Afghan War.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advocate, who asks to be identified only as Sajeda, is
angry at the U.S. government for getting involved during the Soviet
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Afghan people fought the British (gaining its independence
in 1919). Afghanistan could have de feated the Russians without the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   She also feels betrayed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.N. can send peacekeepers to East Timor to pave the
way for ademocratic election, why can't they do it in Afghanistan?
They say, `We must be invited by the government,' but since there
is no government in Afghanistan, that's just an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hassina Sherjan-Samad, founder of Children's Voice,
traveled to Kabul, where, escorted by the Taliban, she visited
classrooms, filled only with boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person with me asked one of the boys if there were any
differences between men and women. This boy, about 12 or 15, said,
`Women have 9 million brain cells, and men have 15 million brain
cells.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was asked, `How do you know?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Physics proved it.' This is what they teach.'' Reach

 EXCITEATHOME PLANS DSL SERVICE  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ExciteAtHome, the nation's largest provider of
cable modem service, has decided to team up with a Colorado company
to provide zippy access to the Internet over phone lines in areas
it can't serve through cable television lines.
</P>
<P>
   Redwood City, Calif.'s ExciteAtHome is expected to announce
today that it will work with Rhythms NetConnections of Englewood,
Colo., near Denver, to roll out digital subscriber lines _ fast
Internet connections over phone lines _ in several major cities
starting in late summer. ExciteAtHome says it will initially target
Los Angeles, New York and other cities where it doesn't have
partnerships with cable TV firms.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Rhythms agreed to pour $15 million into At
Solutions, the ExciteAtHome affiliate that will offer the
residential DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement could be seen as a snub, however, for two Bay
Area DSL providers: Northpoint Communications in San Francisco,
which already works with ExciteAtHome on DSL for the business
market, and Covad Communications in Santa Clara, Calif., which
entered the residential market before Rhythms or Northpoint and has
more consumer customers.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome's Adam Grosser, president of subscriber networks,
said the company picked Rhythms because it liked its plan for
encouraging customers to install DSL themselves, which could cut
costs and speed up the installation process.
</P>
<P>
   The companies will also face stiff competition from local
telephone companies, like Bell Atlantic and Pacific Bell, which
have dominated sales of DSL service to the consumer market. But
Grosser said ExciteAtHome could have an edge over other Internet
service providers, like Mindspring, because it already has 1.15
million high-speed Internet customers and plans a heavy marketing
effort. ``We are the leader in broadband,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, ExciteAtHome could also work with Rhythms and its
cable partners to offer DSL in areas where it has pacts with cable
partners, but the lines haven't been upgraded for speedy Net
service. For instance, ExciteAtHome's local partner, AT&AMP;T, said it
could take several years to upgrade all neighborhoods in San
Francisco, Oakland, San Jose and other area cities for high-speed
Net service.
</P>
<P>
   But Grosser said the company hasn't approached its cable
partners yet, because it first wants to expand into new areas.
Moving into New York, for instance, will allow it to compete
against Time Warner, which serves New York and is in the process of
merging with ExciteAtHome rival America Online.
</P>
<P>
   By partnering with Rhythms, ExciteAtHome said it will expand its
territory to cover 15 million more homes, in addition to the 72
million already in its territory. But ExciteAtHome cannot actually
deliver service to all those customers, because many cable lines
haven't been upgraded and DSL only works over short distances.
Customers too far from a telephone switching office won't be able
to get the service.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome also plans to begin testing high-speed Internet
service over wireless by year end, Grosser said. But he said he
didn't think the company would use satellite technology any time
soon.

AFGHAN WOMEN SUFFERING: U.S., U.N. BLAMED BY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The United States is largely to blame for the
suffering of Afghan women under the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
   It was U.S. action that brought the Taliban to power, and the
Taliban could be removed if the United States and the United
Nations had the will to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the opinions of activists working to help the women.
Since the Taliban militia captured Kabul in 1996, girls have been
prevented from attending school. Women lost their jobs as doctors,
lawyers, teachers and government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Women are under virtual house arrest, prohibited from leaving
their homes unless they're accompanied by a male relative. This
rule is especially hard on the 300,000 wid ows in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When women do go outside, they must be covered from head to toe
with a shroud with only a small piece of mesh over the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They can be beaten for showing an ankle. They lack health care
because male doctors are forbidden from treating women patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, activists lobbied for sup port of Afghan women at
Feminist Expo 2000, an international gather ing of women's rights
advocates in Baltimore that drew about 6,000 women and men from
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the convention was Zieba Shorish-Shamley,
director of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in
Afghanistan. She criticizes the United States for aban doning
Afghanistan after the Soviets ended their occupation in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Russia withdrew, the U.S. lost interest, and that's the
time we needed the U.S. the most,'' Shorish-Shamley said ``That's
when foreign, neighboring countries (such as Paki stan), each with
their own interest, moved in and started supporting different
factions.''
</P>
<P>
   She's angry that the CIA supported the rebels during Soviet
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban _ Pakistan trained it; Saudi Arabia financed it;
and the U.S. blessed it,''Shorish-Stamley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cash, arms, food and medicine for the rebels were channeled from
the United States through the Pakistani intelligence service, said
Philip Smith, director of research and analysis for a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank, the Center for Public Policy Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was staff director for the Congressional Task Force on Af
ghanist an from 1988 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We more or less deferred to them (Pakistani intelligence), and
that was a big mistake,'' Smith said. ``U.S. policy changed
dramatically when bombs went off (at U.S. embassies in 1998) in Dar
es Salaam as well as Nairobi. At that point, I think policymakers
smelled the coffee. Prior to that, they often looked the other way
when fundamentalists were seizing control of Afghani stan.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States blamed Osama Bin Laden for the embassy
bombings and retaliated by bombing what it said was a chemical
factory in the Sudan and three training camps of Bin Laden's in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Clinton administration is prepared to bomb Afghanistan
over Bin Laden, why don't we start pushing the international
community (on behalf of Afghan women)?? asked T. Kuman, an
executive with Amnesty international.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't the U.S. and other countries put pressure on the
three countries that recognize the Taliban _ Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates?''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has become more interested in Afghanistan
because of the oil and gas in former Soviet republics,
Shorish-Shamley said.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Unocal joined a consortium with oil companies
from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia with the idea of building a pipeline
from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan to Pakistan. Unocal dropped
out in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Leno, activist and wife of comedian Jay Leno, wants the
United States to pressure Pakistan to stop supporting the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it clear to our governments that for the rest of their
lives, every time they look in the rear-view mirror, they'll see
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, governments and busi nesses should pressure the
Taliban the way they pressured South Africa to end racial
apartheid, said Deb Ellis, author of the soon-to-be-pub lished book
``Women of the Afghan War.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advocate, who asks to be identified only as Sajeda, is
angry at the U.S. government for getting involved during the Soviet
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Afghan people fought the British (gaining its independence
in 1919). Afghanistan could have de feated the Russians without the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   She also feels betrayed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.N. can send peacekeepers to East Timor to pave the
way for ademocratic election, why can't they do it in Afghanistan?
They say, `We must be invited by the government,' but since there
is no government in Afghanistan, that's just an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hassina Sherjan-Samad, founder of Children's Voice,
traveled to Kabul, where, escorted by the Taliban, she visited
classrooms, filled only with boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person with me asked one of the boys if there were any
differences between men and women. This boy, about 12 or 15, said,
`Women have 9 million brain cells, and men have 15 million brain
cells.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was asked, `How do you know?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Physics proved it.' This is what they teach.'' Reach

POWER FAILURE SHUTS DOWN NATIONAL AIRPORT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: D.C., Va.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A power failure prevented takeoffs and landings at
Reagan National Airport Monday night, forcing planes to divert to
Dulles International Airport west of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Davis, a spokesman at the operations center at Reagan, said
power was lost in the Federal Aviation Administration tower and in
the radar room. The terminal and the runway lights were not
affected, he said, and at 10:15 p.m., the cause of the problem had
still not been found.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines said it was unclear how schedules would be affected on
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Some power was lost at 7:50 p.m., said Eliot Brenner, a
spokesman for the FAA. The airport was able to continue operating
on a generator until 8:40 p.m., he said, when a wider power failure
occurred, forcing the airport to stop commercial takeoffs and
divert landings.
</P>
<P>
   Control over the air space was transferred to Dulles and to a
control center in Leesburg, Va., Mr. Brenner said.

 HIGH ANXIETY COULD PREVAIL IN BEAR MARKET CONDITIONS  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The mighty bull market has been good to a lot of
people for a long time, but it is fraught with psychological
perils. After years of strong and virtually uninterrupted growth in
their financial assets, many investors are not mentally prepared
for a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   When it happens _ if it happens _ the emotional repercussions
could be ugly, experts say. If Mmonday's 5-plus percent plunge on
Nasdaq is any clue to the future, a lot of investors out there had
better prepare themselves for severe mental anguish, loss of
self-esteem, even physical discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Some people will develop all the physical symptoms of
anxiety,'' says Dr. John Schott, a psychiatrist on the Harvard
Medical School faculty who doubles as a money manager. ``Insomnia,
increased heart rate, palpitations, sweating, upset stomach,
increased blood pressure. Some will have depression, self-doubts,
look glum, start to lose interest in things, worry excessively.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors have suffered that kind of emotional damage during
previous bear markets, Schott notes, but ``we probably will see
more of it,'' because there are more individuals than ever in the
market, and many of them ``don't even realize that stocks can go
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while last Tuesday, it looked as though the next major
cardiological and gastrointestinal crisis had begun. Both the Dow
Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index plummeted
more than 500 points midway through that day's trading session.
</P>
<P>
   But they recovered the bulk of their losses before the closing
bell. So, investors mopped their &LR;   &LR; brows, stopped checking their
pulses, wolfed down some Pepto-Bismol and once again faced the
future with hope.
</P>
<P>
   From a psychologist's perspective, what happened that day
started out as a case of jitters among rank-and-file investors,
says Richard Geist, head of the Institute of Psychology and
Investing in Cambridge, Mass. They got nervous just contemplating
the possibility of a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a feeling that a lot of high-tech stocks were
overvalued, and the Nasdaq had run up considerably over the past
year,'' Geist observes. ``People were looking for an excuse to sell
things off.''
</P>
<P>
   Geist, who already has interviewed many investors about last
week's crisis, reports that the sell-off was exacerbated by the
collapse in antitrust negotiations between Microsoft Corp. and the
federal government, as well as by concerns over the Federal
Reserve's string of five interest-rates boosts since the middle of
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Individual selling began to occur, and then portfolio
managers started to get anxious, too,'' Geist remarks. ``Then, what
really precipitated the sell-off was margin calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors are permitted to buy stocks on margin with money
borrowed from their brokers, paying only 50 percent of the price
with their own funds. This gives them powerful leverage, with each
5 percent gain in stock values increasing their investment by 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But when stocks drop, leverage works the other way, causing
margined investments to fall twice as fast as the market. That can
prompt brokers to issue margin calls, demanding that the investors
add more collateral to their accounts. If the investors can't or
won't, the brokers are entitled to liquidate the stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As margin calls kicked in last Tuesday, many investors were
forced to unload vast amounts of stock to cover their losses, and
prices went into a free-fall. When prices reached what many
considered the bargain basement, institutional investors ``began to
come in,'' according to Geist, and prices shot back up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The next time the ending might not be so upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Or, then again, it might.
</P>
<P>
   And when will the next time be, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   That in itself is cause for anxiety, because nobody can
correctly anticipate the stock market consistently. To do so, you
would have to be tapped into the psyches of millions of investors
simultaneously, and even modern technology hasn't found a way to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what is going on'' in the market, says Joan
DiFuria, a Kentfield psychologist who worked at a couple of
commodities exchanges before going into her present line of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that very quickly,'' she says. ``People who had been
buying and selling copper all day for 25 years tried to outguess
the market, but they never could.''
</P>
<P>
   So, proceeding from the proposition that no investor knows for
sure what will happen, it follows that all investors are at the
market's mercy, DiFuria observes.
</P>
<P>
   The wise ones, she says, will prepare themselves for periods
when the market turns bearish. They won't invest in stocks that are
too risky for their emotional makeup, and they will hedge their
bets with stop losses _ orders to sell if a stock sinks to a
certain level _ or put options. Put options allow you to sell a
stock or index at a fixed price, and then go up in value if the
underlying security's price goes down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know yourself, your values, your goals, your
emotional fortitude,'' DiFuria warns. ``People's emotions go up and
down with the Dow. When people have lost money, they usually are
questioning themselves, saying `I wasn't very smart. Why did I do
that?' They get paralyzed, spending all their time watching the
market on TV or on their computer, rather than spending time with
their friends and family, or on their work.''
</P>
<P>
   DiFuria, a long-term investor with holdings in such big-name
tech stocks as America Online, Cisco and Intel, says her way of
dealing with volatility is to follow the market on TV when it is
rising, but when it goes down, ``I shut it off.''

 WEB MAKES IT HARD TO HIDE `SECRET' FACILITY  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It sounds like something from ``Mission
Impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Equinix, a Silicon Valley company, plans to give reporters and
customers today a peek at a top-secret bunker somewhere ``in the
greater San Jose area,'' where it plans to let Internet service
providers and large companies swap e-mail and other Internet
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The Redwood City, Calif., company says the new facility will
feature armed guards, bulletproof walls, hand scanners, bomb
protection and some sort of ``man trap'' to catch intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the company said security is so tight that it forced a
dozen reporters to promise not to reveal the location _ where
people will be shuttled in 20-minute intervals this morning _
before giving them directions. And Equinix asked the federal
Securities and Exchange Commission to keep the location
confidential in documents available to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protecting the anonymity of the facility is a key concern,''
said Equinix spokesman Dave Fonkalsrud. He compared the security at
the site to Fort Knox.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the security measures might be over-hyped.
</P>
<P>
   A San Francisco Chronicle reporter was able to find the site's
address on the Internet within an hour.
</P>
<P>
   He simply went to a Web site run by the City of San Jose,
Calif.'s finance department, plugged the name ``Equinix'' into the
city's database of business licenses and the address popped up: 11
Great Oaks Blvd., in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The address is also on file with the city's planning department.
(Just ask to see file H-99-54.) In addition, the reporter was also
able to find the address within a few minutes by calling the
company's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Fonkalsrud declined to comment on what steps the company took to
conceal the location or why it was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But MAE-West, the West Coast data hub that handles nearly a
quarter of the Internet's traffic, has operated since 1992 with a
public address on Market Street in downtown Palo Alto, Calif.,
without any problems.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom, which operates MAE-West, or the ``Metropolitan
Area Exchange,'' said it has security guards and other measures to
protect the network and only lets its own employees touch the
equipment. But spokeswoman Linda Laughlin said hiding the address
is unnecessary. It would also be difficult, she said, because
countless customers have access to the information.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Internet is really just a conglomeration of
different networks all linked together, companies and ISPs need to
trade messages back and forth at key hubs around the country. As
the Internet has grown, private hubs, like the ones Equinix is
building, have popped up on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Fonkalsrud also declined to give more details about the
company's security measures. But the company bragged about its
efforts in documents filed with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``For security purposes, an Equinix (Internet Business Exchange)
center is anonymous,'' the company said in a document filed in
February.
</P>
<P>
   The company said there were no signs or markers on the outside
of the building that would indicate who was using the building or
why. And Equinix said the building doesn't have any windows or
raised floors, which could conceal intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Each site typically has about nine Equinix workers, plus two
armed security guards on duty all the time, the document said. And
the company has digital cameras stationed throughout the center, as
well as on the roof and around the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Equinix plans to build 30 such facilities worldwide over the
next four years for roughly $1 billion. It opened its first one
last year in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Equinix is also expected to make several announcements Tuesday,
including the formal unveiling of the center and key customers.
Before opening a center, the company told the SEC it would have
agreements from several customers and filled at least 20 percent of
the capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The company originally told reporters the San Jose location
would open in November of last year, but it acknowledged in its
government filings that it has fallen behind schedule in some parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Equinix also said the White House adviser on Internet security,
former National Security Agency Director Mike McConnell, would show
up for the tour along with several Silicon Valley executives: Marc
Andreessen, who helped start Netscape Communications, and Yahoo
co-founder David Filo. Equinix said top executives from several
other companies, including Cisco Systems in San Jose, would also
show up. But a Cisco spokeswoman denied any senior executives would
attend, and said the public relations staff didn't even know about
the event.

 WELLS PICKS UP SNUBBED BANK FOR A SONG  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Wells Fargo Bank said Monday it had agreed to
buy Utah banking power First Security Corp., a jilted bride
abandoned at the altar by another suitor just two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Based on its closing share price of $39.50 Monday, Wells is
paying about $2.9 billion in stock for the Salt Lake City bank,
less than half what Zions Bancorporation said it would pay for its
crosstown rival when their merger was unveiled last June.
</P>
<P>
   That combination was cursed almost from the start, plagued by a
Zions earnings restatement, a government antitrust investigation
and a First Security warning on disappointing March-quarter
profits. The announcement prompted Zions' merger adviser, Goldman
Sachs, to withdraw its endorsement. Late last month the bank's
shareholders rejected the takeover by a 2-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Into that breach stepped Wells. First Security chief executive
Spencer Eccles told reporters he called Richard Kovacevich, his
Wells counterpart, the day after the Zions takeover collapsed. The
two CEOs met on April 3 and came to terms that night.
</P>
<P>
   For San Francisco's Wells, the nation's seventh-largest bank,
the purchase will make it the dominant financial institution in the
Mountain States region. ``Wells has once again shown itself to be
an opportunistic, yet disciplined `buyer,' '' said Joseph Morford,
an analyst at the brokerage firm Dain Rauscher Wessels.
</P>
<P>
   First Security originally paired with Zions as part of an
industry trend in which major regional powers joined forces, a
process that had already swept through New England, the Southeast
and Midwest. Zions, though smaller than First Security, was
considered more nimble and better managed, and was the senior
partner in the proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   First Security is the third-largest bank headquartered in the
West, with $23 billion in assets and a total of 333 branches in
Utah, Idaho and five other Western states. Founded in 1928, it was
the first bank company permitted by federal regulators to have
subsidiaries in more than one state and its president, Marriner
Eccles, served as Federal Reserve Board chairman during the
Roosevelt administration.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, which already has a presence throughout First Security's
territory, will operate banking offices in 23 Western and
Midwestern states when its separate purchase of National Bancorp of
Alaska is completed later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price equals 11.5 times First Security's projected
earnings for the year and 1.6 times its book value, ``well below
comparables for recent transactions,'' Morford calculated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some bank watchers believe that the Utah bank has been
harmed by operational problems and the distraction of its failed
sale to Zions. ``They are totally damaged goods and the question is
how extensive the damage to the franchise has been,'' warned Sean
Ryan, president of the New York investment firm Byrne, Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, First Security said its March-quarter revenue would
drop 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 1999 due mainly to a
decline in its mortgage business as interest rates rose.
</P>
<P>
   Wells said it expects to take $375 million in charges against
earnings as it combines the two banks and will complete the
takeover in the second half of 2000. The bank is likely to cut an
unspecified number of jobs in states outside California where
operations overlap.
</P>
<P>
   The bank won't combine the institutions until 2001, after it has
finished merging the computer systems of the old Norwest and Wells
Fargo. Minneapolis' Norwest bought Wells Fargo and took its name in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   To meet government antitrust requirements, which prohibit one
bank from monopolizing local banking markets, Wells expects to sell
about $1.2 billion in deposits.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its First Security purchase, Wells will acquire the
San Francisco investment bank FS Van Kasper, giving it entree to
stock underwriting and the merger advisory businesses. Wells
expects to add to Van Kasper's staff of more than 300, said Dennis
Mooradian, the bank's president of private client services.
</P>
<P>
   Wells recently took over a small Seattle brokerage, and Van
Kasper is in the process of acquiring an Oregon investment bank,
units that could be combined into a single investment banking and
brokerage operation.

 MONEYBAG: Parents Can Become Good Tax Deductions  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Q: I have been providing material and physical help to my &LR; 
 &LR; ailing father for a few years. His sole income is a Social &LR; 
 &LR; Security check for about $600 per month. He pays $200 per month &LR; 
 &LR; for rent, but rarely spends any other money. I pay for his &LR;   &LR; food,
personal &LR; - &LR; hygiene products, housekeeping, laundry, etc., &LR;   &LR; and am
rarely reimbursed. Can I claim these expenses as a &LR;   &LR; deduction on
my income tax? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A: Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller says you may
be able to claim your father as a dependent, which would entitle
you to an extra $2,750 exemption on your 1999 tax return (rising to
$2,800 on the next return).
</P>
<P>
   To qualify, you must provide more than half your father's total
support for the tax year in question. If your father spent his
entire $7,200 income each year, your contribution to his support
would have to be greater than $7,200. But you indicate that he only
spends about $200 per month on himself, or about $2,400. In that
case, you could claim your father as a dependent by contributing
more than $2,400 to his support.
</P>
<P>
   There are other tests that must be met as well before you can
claim your father as an exemption. Your father's taxable income
must not exceed $2,750 _ which appears to be the case, because
Social Security is not considered taxable income in this
calculation. In addition, your father must be a U.S. citizen, and
must not be filing a joint tax return of his own. The final test,
which no doubt your father can pass with flying colors: He must be
your relative.
</P>
<P>
   That last test is not considered a slur against your mother.
Congress prescribed it to prevent taxpayers from claiming
non-relatives as dependents, unless they live under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   You don't specifically mention your father's medical expenses,
but assuming that you pay them, you might be able to add them to
any medical deduction you claim for yourself and your immediate
family. Three of the tests mentioned above apply in this case: You
must provide more than half his support, he must be a U.S. citizen,
and (chuckle) he must be your relative.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Q: In your column a while back you compared mutual funds and &LR; 
 &LR; trusts that track the stock-market indexes, and suggested that &LR; 
 &LR; trusts offer certain advantages over funds. I'm having trouble &LR; 
 &LR; finding more information about these trusts. My discount broker &LR; 
 &LR; can't or won't help me, and a book I bought by a Princeton &LR; 
 &LR; University professor mentions only index funds, not trusts. Can &LR; 
 &LR; you offer any further information? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A: Most of the index-tracking trusts are traded on the American
Stock Exchange. Take a look at their Web site, at  &LR; www.amex.com &LR; . &LR; 
 &LR; Click on the prompt for ``Index Shares,'' then follow other
prompts that will help you learn more about a broad assortment of
trusts, including those that follow the Dow Jones industrial
average, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, the Nasdaq 100 index and
various sub-indexes, such as the S&AMP;P Utilities and S&AMP;P Energy.
</P>
<P>
   I like trusts better than funds because they offer greater
flexibility. They trade as stocks, so you can move in and out
during the day and sell them short _ something you can't do with
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Also, they charge small management fees _ generally less than
0.2 percent of the trust assets annually. Some _ though not all _
index funds charge upward of 1 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   When I wrote the earlier column touting index trusts, one reader
disputed my analysis, pointing out that you must pay brokerage
commissions to buy and sell trust shares. While I should have
pointed that out myself, I don't think it is much of a drawback in
an era when several online discount brokers charge only $5 to $10
per trade. A large management fee probably will hurt you a lot
more.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Q: Early in the morning, before the New York Stock Exchange &LR; 
 &LR; opens for trading, I'll listen to the Bloomberg ``Market &LR; 
 &LR; Minute'' on the radio, and they sometimes say what the S&AMP;P &LR; 
 &LR; futures are currently trading at. I've even heard them mention &LR; 
 &LR; Nasdaq futures. Why are they being traded before the NYSE &LR; 
 &LR; opens? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A: Not content to gamble money only during regular hours,
traders in stock-index futures also risk financial ruin on
electronic exchanges throughout the evening and night, and in the
wee hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   If index futures rise during off-hours, it means that the
preponderance of off-hours traders think the stock market will
start off strong in the next regular session, perhaps because one
or two key companies reported unexpectedly strong earnings after
the stock markets closed for the day. If index futures are down,
the traders are betting that the market will be weak at the opening
_ perhaps because some big company reported disappointing earnings,
or because Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made another of
his wet-blanket speeches at a rubber-chicken dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the overnight traders are correct. Sometimes they
aren't. Don't bet the farm on their powers of prognostication.

<HEADLINE>
EDITORIAL: BREAKING THE ICE IN KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 11:
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected announcement on Monday that the leaders of North
and South Korea plan to meet in June could lead to a lessening of
tensions on the Cold War's last military frontier. The talks
between South Korea's president, Kim Dae-jung, and Kim Jong-il, the
North Korean leader, would be the first discussion between the
leaders of the two Koreas since the peninsula was divided after
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly 50 years since an armistice ended the Korean War.
But a peace agreement has yet to be signed. Each side has stationed
hundreds of thousands of troops on either side of a demilitarized
zone filled with tank barriers and minefields. Some 37,000 American
troops remain permanently based in South Korea to bolster Seoul's
defenses should the North again attack. Meanwhile, North Korea's
flirtation with nuclear weapons and long-range missiles compounds
the dangers and the risk of renewed American military involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the North's main motive in seeking this meeting seems
to be its desire to take up Seoul's offers of humanitarian relief
and economic assistance, the South is sure to bring up security
issues as well. For years, North Korea tried to reach around South
Korean leaders to strike a deal with the United States. Washington
has wisely insisted that direct dialogue between North and South
Korea must come first.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kim Dae-jung was elected South Korea's president in 1997,
he has courted new business, tourist and humanitarian ties with the
North. His ``sunshine policy'' has tried to couple continued
military vigilance with new openings aimed at encouraging more
predictable, less dangerous relations across the 38th Parallel. The
announcement of the June meetings, to take place in the North
Korean capital, Pyongyang, confirms the wisdom of Seoul's approach.
It does so at a particularly helpful time for Kim, just three days
before important congressional elections that will determine how
much political authority he commands during the remaining three
years of his term.
</P>
<P>
   The North's agreement to these meetings seems to demonstrate
that Kim Jong- il is now firmly in charge of North Korea and
inclined to reach out diplomatically to the wider world. In recent
weeks the once reclusive North has sought improved ties not just
with Seoul but with various European countries, China, Japan and
the United States. Though political developments inside North Korea
remain largely opaque, this spurt of diplomatic activity must be
considered encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is still dangerous and unpredictable. Its economy
barely functions and there are fears that it could abruptly
collapse, sending millions of refugees fleeing south and perhaps
sparking clashes across the DMZ. Seoul should approach this meeting
carefully. Previous efforts to bring together the top Northern and
Southern leaders have fallen through. If the June meetings proceed
as planned, however, they could start a belated but hopeful thaw in
relations between the two Koreas.  &QL;

 NET WORTH: WHATEVER B2B2C IS, IT'S CLEARLY THE PLACE 2B  &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ First there was B2B, short for
business-to-business Internet companies like Ariba and Commerce
One.
</P>
<P>
   Then came B2C, applied retroactively to business-to-consumer
companies like Amazon.com, Yahoo or America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The next logical step was C2C, a nickname for
consumer-to-consumer companies like eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Now get ready for (drum roll, please) B2B2C.
</P>
<P>
   Given that no industry loves acronyms more than technology, it
was only a matter of time before this tongue-twister emerged.
</P>
<P>
   What it stands for, if you haven't guessed, is
business-to-business-to-consumer, but what it means is still a work
in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Generically, it describes companies that sell products or
services to companies that in turn sell to consumers, all via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the offline world, they might be called ``vendors'' or
``consultants.'' But in the online world, a little jargon _
especially if it includes B2B _ might add millions to a company's
market value.
</P>
<P>
   The first time B2B2C appears in the Dow Jones Interactive
database is in a September 27, 1999 story in Computergram
International about OrderTrust:
</P>
<P>
   ``OrderTrust Inc. makes its money from transactions made over
the Web by sitting in the middle of a transaction and connecting
call centers to Web front ends to suppliers to payment processors.
OrderTrust likes to think of itself in a separate space to the
business-to-business players. ... it says it is in the `b2b2c
space.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; From that inauspicious _ and incomprehensible _ &UR;  &LR; start, the
term has been gaining steam at investment and venture-capital
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: Many B2C companies, especially e-tailers, are in
trouble. Big trouble. A lot of them spent enormous sums late last
year to lure customers to their sites, but most of those customers
didn't buy much or never returned.
</P>
<P>
   Online businesses spent 57 percent of their marketing dollars on
customer acquisition, 37 percent on brand awareness and only 6
percent on customer retention last year, according to a study last
summer by Boston Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
   To stay in business, e-tailers obviously need to squeeze more
money out of every customer. And that's where B2B2C companies come
in, says Joanna Rees Gallanter of Venture Strategy, a San Francisco
VC firm.
</P>
<P>
   One example is Net Perceptions Inc. (NETP), a Minneapolis
company that sells ``recommendation'' software. A B2C merchant
installs the software on its Web site and it tracks a customer's
purchases and navigation habits and compares them to the records of
others who have similar preferences and navigation habits, then
comes up with something the customer might like to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It plays the role of a virtual salesman,'' says Gallanter,
whose firm seeks out B2B2C plays.
</P>
<P>
   Net Perceptions' customers include barnesandnoble.com, CDnow,
Preview Travel and Ticketmaster Online.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples include Netcentives Inc. (NCNT) and MyPoints.com
(MYPT). Both are based in San Francisco and sell loyalty marketing
programs to Web sites and some offline customers. Although they
differ in some ways, both programs reward customers who buy online
with airline miles or points they can use to buy other merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Netcentives' customers include Lycos, the AOL AAdvantage
program, Disney's Go.com and the American Express blue card.
</P>
<P>
   MyPoints' customers include About.com and ExciteAtHome. MyPoints
also runs offline loyalty programs for Albertson's and Kroger. The
company's upcoming annual report features B2B2C on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; B2C Converts
</P>
<P>
   Another group of B2B2C companies got started in the B2C market,
but figured they could do better selling their Internet expertise
to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves Inc. (ASKJ) began as a natural-language search engine
for consumers. Now the Emeryville, Calif., company is selling its
search technology under a private label to other companies _ such
as DaimlerChrysler, Compaq and Radio Shack _ that use it to answer
customer questions on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their B2C business isn't bad,'' says Ryan Jacob, manager of
the Jacob Internet fund. ``But clearly the business-to-business
side is where there's opportunity for tremendous growth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest quarter, the consumer service accounted for
two-thirds of Ask Jeeves' $10.9 million in revenues and the
corporate service accounted for one-third. Losses were $23.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Another company that started out in B2C is Cyberian Outpost
Inc., best known its ad showing a gerbil being shot out of a
cannon. It originally sold computer hardware to consumers online, a
cutthroat business that has already claimed several victims.
</P>
<P>
   The Kent, Conn., company, which is changing its name to
Outpost.com, hasn't abandoned the consumer business, but it has
started selling turnkey e-commerce services to others companies,
mainly brick-and-mortar retailers that want to go online but don't
know how.
</P>
<P>
   Outpost.com will design, build and run a company's Web site and
handle everything from inventory management to fulfillment to
product returns.
</P>
<P>
   John Seabern, co-portfolio manager of RS Diversified Growth fund
in San Francisco, is a big fan of Outpost (COOL), in part because a
new management team seems to have gotten the consumer side of the
business under control. But the main attraction is its B2B side.
</P>
<P>
   The company ``has developed an excellent infrastructure,'' he
says. It guarantees free, next-day delivery for all products sold
through its own and its corporate customers' sites.
</P>
<P>
   It has contracts with six retailers including Brookstone and
Wolf Camera. ``We expect another 20 by the end of the year,''
Seabern says.
</P>
<P>
   Seabern says that selling Internet services to other companies
is a ``much higher-margin business'' than selling directly to
consumers. ``There's no capital going into it, and there's no
inventory risk.'' Although Outpost might manage and even warehouse
a customer's inventory, in most cases it doesn't take ownership so
it doesn't have the financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   Outpost spokesman Jim Gallagher estimates that B2B2C sales will
grow from 5 percent of revenues currently to 20 percent by year
end.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, any B2B2C business is only as good as its customers.
And unless e-commerce becomes profitable, none of these companies
are going to be around long.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an investor, you have to look at the risks associated with
having a lot of customers that are dot-com players and marginal
businesses,'' says Jacob. Fortunately, ``you're going to see a lot
of these companies diversifying their customer bases to include
offline businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell whether B2B2C is 2GR82B4GOT10, or just
another fad. But since we're on Internet time here, it shouldn't
take long.

 HIGH ANXIETY COULD PREVAIL IN BEAR MARKET CONDITIONS  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The mighty bull market has been good to a lot of
people for a long time, but it is fraught with psychological
perils. After years of strong and virtually uninterrupted growth in
their financial assets, many investors are not mentally prepared
for a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   When it happens _ if it happens _ the emotional repercussions
could be ugly, experts say. If Mmonday's 5-plus percent plunge on
Nasdaq is any clue to the future, a lot of investors out there had
better prepare themselves for severe mental anguish, loss of
self-esteem, even physical discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Some people will develop all the physical symptoms of
anxiety,'' says Dr. John Schott, a psychiatrist on the Harvard
Medical School faculty who doubles as a money manager. ``Insomnia,
increased heart rate, palpitations, sweating, upset stomach,
increased blood pressure. Some will have depression, self-doubts,
look glum, start to lose interest in things, worry excessively.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors have suffered that kind of emotional damage during
previous bear markets, Schott notes, but ``we probably will see
more of it,'' because there are more individuals than ever in the
market, and many of them ``don't even realize that stocks can go
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while last Tuesday, it looked as though the next major
cardiological and gastrointestinal crisis had begun. Both the Dow
Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index plummeted
more than 500 points midway through that day's trading session.
</P>
<P>
   But they recovered the bulk of their losses before the closing
bell. So, investors mopped their &LR;   &LR; brows, stopped checking their
pulses, wolfed down some Pepto-Bismol and once again faced the
future with hope.
</P>
<P>
   From a psychologist's perspective, what happened that day
started out as a case of jitters among rank-and-file investors,
says Richard Geist, head of the Institute of Psychology and
Investing in Cambridge, Mass. They got nervous just contemplating
the possibility of a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a feeling that a lot of high-tech stocks were
overvalued, and the Nasdaq had run up considerably over the past
year,'' Geist observes. ``People were looking for an excuse to sell
things off.''
</P>
<P>
   Geist, who already has interviewed many investors about last
week's crisis, reports that the sell-off was exacerbated by the
collapse in antitrust negotiations between Microsoft Corp. and the
federal government, as well as by concerns over the Federal
Reserve's string of five interest-rates boosts since the middle of
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Individual selling began to occur, and then portfolio
managers started to get anxious, too,'' Geist remarks. ``Then, what
really precipitated the sell-off was margin calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors are permitted to buy stocks on margin with money
borrowed from their brokers, paying only 50 percent of the price
with their own funds. This gives them powerful leverage, with each
5 percent gain in stock values increasing their investment by 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But when stocks drop, leverage works the other way, causing
margined investments to fall twice as fast as the market. That can
prompt brokers to issue margin calls, demanding that the investors
add more collateral to their accounts. If the investors can't or
won't, the brokers are entitled to liquidate the stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As margin calls kicked in last Tuesday, many investors were
forced to unload vast amounts of stock to cover their losses, and
prices went into a free-fall. When prices reached what many
considered the bargain basement, institutional investors ``began to
come in,'' according to Geist, and prices shot back up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The next time the ending might not be so upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Or, then again, it might.
</P>
<P>
   And when will the next time be, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   That in itself is cause for anxiety, because nobody can
correctly anticipate the stock market consistently. To do so, you
would have to be tapped into the psyches of millions of investors
simultaneously, and even modern technology hasn't found a way to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what is going on'' in the market, says Joan
DiFuria, a Kentfield psychologist who worked at a couple of
commodities exchanges before going into her present line of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that very quickly,'' she says. ``People who had been
buying and selling copper all day for 25 years tried to outguess
the market, but they never could.''
</P>
<P>
   So, proceeding from the proposition that no investor knows for
sure what will happen, it follows that all investors are at the
market's mercy, DiFuria observes.
</P>
<P>
   The wise ones, she says, will prepare themselves for periods
when the market turns bearish. They won't invest in stocks that are
too risky for their emotional makeup, and they will hedge their
bets with stop losses _ orders to sell if a stock sinks to a
certain level _ or put options. Put options allow you to sell a
stock or index at a fixed price, and then go up in value if the
underlying security's price goes down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know yourself, your values, your goals, your
emotional fortitude,'' DiFuria warns. ``People's emotions go up and
down with the Dow. When people have lost money, they usually are
questioning themselves, saying `I wasn't very smart. Why did I do
that?' They get paralyzed, spending all their time watching the
market on TV or on their computer, rather than spending time with
their friends and family, or on their work.''
</P>
<P>
   DiFuria, a long-term investor with holdings in such big-name
tech stocks as America Online, Cisco and Intel, says her way of
dealing with volatility is to follow the market on TV when it is
rising, but when it goes down, ``I shut it off.''

 NET WORTH: WHATEVER B2B2C IS, IT'S CLEARLY THE PLACE 2B  &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ First there was B2B, short for
business-to-business Internet companies like Ariba and Commerce
One.
</P>
<P>
   Then came B2C, applied retroactively to business-to-consumer
companies like Amazon.com, Yahoo or America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The next logical step was C2C, a nickname for
consumer-to-consumer companies like eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Now get ready for (drum roll, please) B2B2C.
</P>
<P>
   Given that no industry loves acronyms more than technology, it
was only a matter of time before this tongue-twister emerged.
</P>
<P>
   What it stands for, if you haven't guessed, is
business-to-business-to-consumer, but what it means is still a work
in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Generically, it describes companies that sell products or
services to companies that in turn sell to consumers, all via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the offline world, they might be called ``vendors'' or
``consultants.'' But in the online world, a little jargon _
especially if it includes B2B _ might add millions to a company's
market value.
</P>
<P>
   The first time B2B2C appears in the Dow Jones Interactive
database is in a September 27, 1999 story in Computergram
International about OrderTrust:
</P>
<P>
   ``OrderTrust Inc. makes its money from transactions made over
the Web by sitting in the middle of a transaction and connecting
call centers to Web front ends to suppliers to payment processors.
OrderTrust likes to think of itself in a separate space to the
business-to-business players. ... it says it is in the `b2b2c
space.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; From that inauspicious _ and incomprehensible _ &UR;  &LR; start, the
term has been gaining steam at investment and venture-capital
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: Many B2C companies, especially e-tailers, are in
trouble. Big trouble. A lot of them spent enormous sums late last
year to lure customers to their sites, but most of those customers
didn't buy much or never returned.
</P>
<P>
   Online businesses spent 57 percent of their marketing dollars on
customer acquisition, 37 percent on brand awareness and only 6
percent on customer retention last year, according to a study last
summer by Boston Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
   To stay in business, e-tailers obviously need to squeeze more
money out of every customer. And that's where B2B2C companies come
in, says Joanna Rees Gallanter of Venture Strategy, a San Francisco
VC firm.
</P>
<P>
   One example is Net Perceptions Inc. (NETP), a Minneapolis
company that sells ``recommendation'' software. A B2C merchant
installs the software on its Web site and it tracks a customer's
purchases and navigation habits and compares them to the records of
others who have similar preferences and navigation habits, then
comes up with something the customer might like to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It plays the role of a virtual salesman,'' says Gallanter,
whose firm seeks out B2B2C plays.
</P>
<P>
   Net Perceptions' customers include barnesandnoble.com, CDnow,
Preview Travel and Ticketmaster Online.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples include Netcentives Inc. (NCNT) and MyPoints.com
(MYPT). Both are based in San Francisco and sell loyalty marketing
programs to Web sites and some offline customers. Although they
differ in some ways, both programs reward customers who buy online
with airline miles or points they can use to buy other merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Netcentives' customers include Lycos, the AOL AAdvantage
program, Disney's Go.com and the American Express blue card.
</P>
<P>
   MyPoints' customers include About.com and ExciteAtHome. MyPoints
also runs offline loyalty programs for Albertson's and Kroger. The
company's upcoming annual report features B2B2C on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; B2C Converts
</P>
<P>
   Another group of B2B2C companies got started in the B2C market,
but figured they could do better selling their Internet expertise
to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves Inc. (ASKJ) began as a natural-language search engine
for consumers. Now the Emeryville, Calif., company is selling its
search technology under a private label to other companies _ such
as DaimlerChrysler, Compaq and Radio Shack _ that use it to answer
customer questions on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their B2C business isn't bad,'' says Ryan Jacob, manager of
the Jacob Internet fund. ``But clearly the business-to-business
side is where there's opportunity for tremendous growth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest quarter, the consumer service accounted for
two-thirds of Ask Jeeves' $10.9 million in revenues and the
corporate service accounted for one-third. Losses were $23.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Another company that started out in B2C is Cyberian Outpost
Inc., best known its ad showing a gerbil being shot out of a
cannon. It originally sold computer hardware to consumers online, a
cutthroat business that has already claimed several victims.
</P>
<P>
   The Kent, Conn., company, which is changing its name to
Outpost.com, hasn't abandoned the consumer business, but it has
started selling turnkey e-commerce services to others companies,
mainly brick-and-mortar retailers that want to go online but don't
know how.
</P>
<P>
   Outpost.com will design, build and run a company's Web site and
handle everything from inventory management to fulfillment to
product returns.
</P>
<P>
   John Seabern, co-portfolio manager of RS Diversified Growth fund
in San Francisco, is a big fan of Outpost (COOL), in part because a
new management team seems to have gotten the consumer side of the
business under control. But the main attraction is its B2B side.
</P>
<P>
   The company ``has developed an excellent infrastructure,'' he
says. It guarantees free, next-day delivery for all products sold
through its own and its corporate customers' sites.
</P>
<P>
   It has contracts with six retailers including Brookstone and
Wolf Camera. ``We expect another 20 by the end of the year,''
Seabern says.
</P>
<P>
   Seabern says that selling Internet services to other companies
is a ``much higher-margin business'' than selling directly to
consumers. ``There's no capital going into it, and there's no
inventory risk.'' Although Outpost might manage and even warehouse
a customer's inventory, in most cases it doesn't take ownership so
it doesn't have the financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   Outpost spokesman Jim Gallagher estimates that B2B2C sales will
grow from 5 percent of revenues currently to 20 percent by year
end.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, any B2B2C business is only as good as its customers.
And unless e-commerce becomes profitable, none of these companies
are going to be around long.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an investor, you have to look at the risks associated with
having a lot of customers that are dot-com players and marginal
businesses,'' says Jacob. Fortunately, ``you're going to see a lot
of these companies diversifying their customer bases to include
offline businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell whether B2B2C is 2GR82B4GOT10, or just
another fad. But since we're on Internet time here, it shouldn't
take long.

EDITORIAL: DRUG PRICES AND MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 11:
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health and Human Services issued a report on
Monday that highlighted alarming disparities in prescription drug
costs for Medicare beneficiaries. The Medicare recipients who lack
drug coverage are charged significantly more _ and are thus forced
to do without medicine more often _ than Medicare recipients who
have obtained drug coverage one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, about a third of Medicare beneficiaries have no drug
coverage at all. The rest have drug coverage through plans provided
by former employers, Medigap plans that they buy themselves,
Medicaid, or through Medicare health maintenance organizations that
provide drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The new study found that Medicare recipients without drug
coverage were typically charged 15 percent more for the same drug
at the pharmacy than were individuals whose drug costs had been
negotiated by insurers or by pharmacy benefit managers, companies
that administer and negotiate drug prices for health plans. That is
because those large entities are able to obtain price discounts for
drugs from pharmacy chains. The report does not even take into
account direct rebates from manufacturers that insurers and benefit
managers can get for increasing a manufacturer's market share in a
particular drug field. Such rebates can further reduce the price of
prescription drugs between 2 and 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The price disparities make a persuasive case for providing a
drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries. A key part of
President Clinton's Medicare drug benefit plan would allow those
currently without drug coverage to get lower drug prices by using
pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate with retailers and
manufacturers. Several competing proposals in Congress also include
contracting with private benefit managers to get group price
discounts, though the plans differ in details.
</P>
<P>
   The market is working unfairly against the elderly who have no
drug coverage. Medicare reform must give them the means to use
their collective purchasing power in getting better prices on
prescription drugs.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William C. Stokoe Jr., an iconoclastic linguistics professor
whose championing of sign language helped change the way deaf
people are educated around the world, died on April 4 at his home
in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Stokoe was credited with winning recognition of American Sign
Language as a genuine language, overcoming the contentions of
linguists that it was little more than a rudimentary imitation of
the spoken word. Eventually, Stokoe's work helped end a
century-long banishment of signing from the classroom and won him a
hero's status among many deaf students.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say it was a bombshell,'' Oliver Sacks, the author and
neurologist, said of Stokoe's work. But he added: ``It was a rather
slow bomb. The recognition he encountered was by no means
immediate, because of very entrenched sort of attitudes, even among
the deaf themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stokoe (pronounced STOH-key) arrived in 1955 at Gallaudet
University, the only university for the hearing-impaired in the
United States, he knew little about sign language or even about
deafness. His only extended encounter with it came in his dealings
as a farm boy in Stafford, N.Y., with a local blacksmith who was
deaf, said Jane Maher, who wrote a biography of Stokoe. The two
used to pass each other notes, Maher said.
</P>
<P>
   Stokoe went to Gallaudet, which is in Washington, to teach
English. His passion was Middle English, and like all other
professors at the university, he was expected to instruct without
using sign language.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1880s, when a movement against signing began at an
international conference in Milan, schools for the deaf had
insisted that their students communicate orally, an often
unsuccessful practice that involves lip-reading and trying to
produce understandable sounds. Opponents of signing believed that
oralism, as the teaching method was known, offered students their
best chance at becoming part of the hearing world, and in the early
days of the movement, those who were caught signing were punished.
</P>
<P>
   Among themselves, of course, students signed away, relishing the
opportunity to communicate freely in the fashion that had arisen
spontaneously throughout history whenever deaf people were together
in sufficient numbers. Stokoe had studied some linguistics, and
when he saw the signing at Gallaudet, he became fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He underwent a sort of conversion, an epiphany and a
revelation when he got to Gallaudet,'' said Sacks, who knew Stokoe
for about 15 years and wrote an introduction to Maher's book. ``And
he realized intuitively that something remarkable was going on
among the students. And then he became sort of learner as much as
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last book, ``Language in Hand'' (which Gallaudet
University Press is now putting together), Stokoe wrote, ``At that
point, my idea was simply that the signing American deaf people do
is a language.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years after he arrived at Gallaudet, Stokoe published the
groundbreaking ``Sign Language Structure.'' Four years later, he
was the co-author of ``A Dictionary of American Sign Language on
Linguistic Principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The books helped prove that sign language met the definition of
a language. If every dissenter was not convinced, Stokoe's beliefs
gradually drew wide acceptance and persuaded schools for the deaf
to re-evaluate their approaches. It is now common for schools to
use both oral and signing methods of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   If Stokoe's work proved persuasive, he himself was often nothing
less than contentious, associates said. In her biography, ``Seeing
Language in Sign: The Work of William C. Stokoe'' (Gallaudet
University Press, 1996), Maher recounts how he earned the nickname
Stubborn Stokoe in high school after convincing his physics teacher
that he deserved a 100, not a 98, on an exam. (He was also gifted
at language, learning to read by 3, Maher said.)
</P>
<P>
   Stubbornness was a trait that remained with him for life. In his
last book, he still sounded scornful of those linguists who had
accepted the ``fallacy'' that lack of speech meant lack of
language, arguing that ``demographics and cultural oppression
facilitated the conceit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This cultural oppression made encountering deaf signing an
even rarer occurrence than deaf people's small number would
merit,'' Stokoe wrote. ``Virtually everyone's first impression
(`These people are not speaking!') led to the false conclusion that
they were not using language. Instead of seeing language in a
different channel, the naive observer, hearing no speech, supposed
language was absent too.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokoe's work made him highly respected among deaf students,
especially as some became radicalized in recent years. ``He was
really quite revered by deaf people throughout the world for this
accomplishment,'' said a longtime friend, David F. Armstrong, the
budget director at Gallaudet.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was not active in the effort, Stokoe, many people
believe, was a driving force behind the student demonstrations in
the 1980's that forced Gallaudet to choose its first deaf
president.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Stokoe was caring for his wife, Ruth, who died
last year after battling Alzheimer's disease. When he could no
longer care for her at home, Maher said, Stokoe visited her every
day in the nursing home, reading to her from her favorite English
books. Ruth Stokoe had helped her husband operate Linstok Press, a
publisher. Stokoe, who became emeritus professor after retiring in
1984, was also the founder of the journal Sign Language Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Stokoe is survived by a son, James, of Chevy Chase, and a
daughter, Helen, of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Associates said Stokoe would be remembered, if not necessarily
mourned, for another passion besides sign language: playing the
bagpipes. He was a member of the Washington Scottish Pipe Band and
liked to march around the Gallaudet campus in full regalia,
ignoring _ or perhaps enjoying _ the reaction.

DODGERS' BROWN TO MISS JUST TWO WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In they limped, or at least what's left of them.
One week into the new season, and the Los Angeles Dodgers are
already making like the walking wounded.
</P>
<P>
   On their day off Monday, the Dodgers worked out at Pacific Bell
Park, counted heads and tried counting their blessings.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is they now hope right-hander Kevin Brown may only
be lost for a couple of weeks with his fractured right pinkie,
instead of the more extreme five-to-six-week scenario some first
feared.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was examined in Los Angeles on Monday by doctors Norman
Zemel and Frank Jobe, who told him he could take the splint off for
some light throwing but should avoid actually pitching for a couple
of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If kicking and screaming, the competitive Brown is expected to
be placed on the disabled list Thursday. They have yet to decide
who will take his spot on the roster and in the rotation, but
disappointing Carlos Perez - who was supposed to be sent to
Triple-A to get a couple of starts in while the fifth spot in the
rotation was skipped - remains with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put (Brown) on the disabled list and we're
looking at going with (Eric) Gagne, (Mike) Judd or possibly Carlos
Perez,'' said general manager Kevin Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson said it was a ``good probability'' that
Perez would start.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is left-hander Jeff Williams, who was with
the Dodgers on Monday and will be added to the roster today when
right-hander Gregg Olson is placed on the disabled list. For now,
Williams goes into the bullpen, but they need to name a starter for
Thursday's series finale against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Olson has an irritated nerve in his right forearm that Johnson
said needs rest and may require an anti-inflammatory injection.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is hoping Brown may be able to rejoin the rotation when
he comes off the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, he'll be able to throw enough in there to where at
the end of that period he can come back and start when he comes off
the DL,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, outfielder Gary Sheffield (sprained right ankle)
practiced and first baseman Eric Karros (strained back) did not.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield took batting practice but complained of his lateral
movement in the outfield, and noticing Karros was missing, threw a
new suggestion at Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if Eric was going to play, and I told him it was
doubtful,'' Johnson said. ``So he said, `How 'bout if I play
first?' I said that was an interesting thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield took a few grounders at first after practice and said
it was easier on the ankle at this strange position. Sheffield, who
broke in with Milwaukee as a shortstop, has never played first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine over there,'' Sheffield said. ``You don't have to
run as much. I don't think it would be a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, either Karros will play or veteran Geronimo Berroa
will start against Giants left-hander Kirk Rueter. If Sheffield
can't play, then Johnson can turn to F.P. Santangelo in left.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Karros can't go, my bench is versatile enough that I can
put a right-hander over there or one in the outfield,'' Johnson
said. ``That's something I couldn't do last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Berroa, who is playing for his ninth major-league club, was
called up when Perez was sent down after his disastrous opening
start in Montreal. Perez can be called back immediately if it is
due to injury.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield said he would have to wait until today to determine if
he could play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game-day decision, really,'' he said. ``But it's better
than it was yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   All this shuffling could have been avoided, of course, if the
Dodgers had their Saturday game in New York snowed out instead of
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Tidbits: Fox owns which team? A billboard in San Francisco
reads: ``Go Dodgers,'' with the Fox logo underneath. Only ``Go'' is
crossed out graffiti-style, and the word ``stinks'' added after
Dodgers.... As if the Dodgers weren't having enough problems, their
phone system went down for most of the day Monday at Dodger
Stadium.... Before the workout, there was a team meeting so club
officials could explain how renovated Dodger Stadium would impact
the players. They'll have a new parking lot and family lounge....
Trainer Stan Johnson said although Brown doesn't need his small
finger to throw, he could aggravate it by pitching in a game while
hitting, fielding or if he fell on it. ``Any of that and it could
become a bigger problem,'' Johnston said.

EDITORIAL: A BROADER AUDIENCE FOR THE COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 11:
</P>
<P>
   Before April is out, the Supreme Court is to hear arguments in
three cases of great interest and importance. It is too bad the
court still refuses to allow televised coverage of its proceedings,
thereby depriving the public of access that could prove enormously
instructive.
</P>
<P>
   On April 19, the justices will consider whether the Miranda
warnings long required before police can interrogate a suspect in
custody were effectively overruled by Congress. On April 25 the
court will hear arguments on the effort by various states and
Congress to water down abortion rights by criminalizing a vaguely
defined surgical procedure dubbed partial birth abortion. A day
later, legal advocates will spar over whether the Boy Scouts has a
constitutional right to exclude gay youths and adults from
membership.
</P>
<P>
   These are complex legal and social issues about which many
Americans are still trying to make up their minds. The legal
debates in the nation's highest court would be an ideal chance for
the public to consider the weighty constitutional issues in play.
But that is not to be, thanks to the court's aversion to allowing
television coverage of oral arguments similar to C-Span's
enlightening coverage of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Several justices are said to be reluctant to surrender their
personal privacy. But the Supreme Court belongs to the public, not
the justices. Some justices are also said to worry that televising
the arguments would provide a distorted view of the court's work,
which mostly takes place when cases are discussed, and decided,
behind closed doors. That underestimates Americans' intelligence
and the value of openness in promoting the public's understanding
of issues and respect for the court.

NCAA CONSIDERS SCHOLARSHIP LIMITS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The NCAA's Management Council began a campaign to solve some of
college basketball's major problems yesterday by adopting proposals
regarding scholarship limitations and summer recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   The Management Council approved a recommendation that would
limit a Division I men's program to awarding eight scholarships
during any two-year period with a limit of five scholarships in any
given year (total scholarships would remain at 13). Also, the
council voted to cut the summer recruiting period in half in 2001
with the plan to develop legislation that would significantly alter
the summer recruiting model for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea with the scholarship limitations is to emphasize to
the schools and the recruits that the fit between school and
athlete should be a good one,'' said Stanford athletic director Ted
Leland, chair of the Management Council.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, the NCAA's board of directors (presidents) will
vote on the Management Council's recommendations. Thus far, the
presidents have used their rubber stamp 95 percent of the time in
approving proposals advanced by the council.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting the number of scholarships, the council believes, would
help graduation rates. However, the newly formed Student Basketball
Council is against those limitations because it believes it reduces
the opportunity for players to transfer because schools will be
more miserly with their scholarships on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal that the council believes will help graduation
rates will allow men's and women's basketball players to attend
summer school at their college before their freshmen seasons. This
``early immersion'' allows for a scholarship money to allow players
to attend up to six hours of summer school before their first fall
semester.
</P>
<P>
   The complex issue of summer recruiting figures to provide an
ongoing challenge. The 24-day evaluation period has been in effect
for more than a decade. It allows coaches to analyze and assess
hundreds of players at various tournaments and ``showcases'' around
the country. For smaller schools, it is a ``one-stop'' recruiting
opportunity that provides the most bang for the buck.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that the summer recruiting period is populated
by people the NCAA deems ``undesirables.'' While doing away with
summer recruiting is impractical, the NCAA wants to somehow regain
control from the influential shoe companies and street agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we've had the wrong people become involved with
summer recruiting,'' said NCAA president Cedric Dempsey, who at the
Final Four recommended that summer recruiting be eliminated.
``Those people are involved with influencing young people, and they
shouldn't be in that position. We think it's time to put an end to
the `hand out' system.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Management Council said today in a strong voice is
that there is no longer support for the current system.''

<P>
   Rangers second basemen are hitting a combined .583 after the
first week of the season. Luis Alicea is 8-for-12 when playing
second base, and Frank Catalanotto is 6-for-12.
</P>
<P>
   That's the highest batting average at one position for any team
in the American League. Only two other teams have positions where
players are batting over .500.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim Angels left fielder Darin Erstad is batting .556 with 15
hits in 27 at-bats, and the Baltimore Orioles' first basemen are
hitting .579 (11-for-19) because Will Clark (9-for-18 overall) has
eight hits in 14 at-bats at first base. AL second basemen this
season Team H AB Avg. Rangers 14 26 .583 Angels 9 25 .360 Orioles 8

Mariners 3 22 .136 THOMPSON THROWS
</P>
<P>
   Rangers left-hander Justin Thompson threw 71 pitches in an
extended spring training game yesterday against the Minnesota
Twins' extended spring training team.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, rehabilitating from off-season shoulder surgery, threw
six innings, allowing two runs on one hit and one walk. He struck
out five.
</P>
<P>
   If he shows no ill effects after his workout, he is scheduled to
pitch on another rehabilitation assignment Saturday for Class-A
Port Charlotte against Sarasota. RANGERS AT YANKEES
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers open a two-game series tomorrow at 1:05 p.m. at
Yankee Stadium, where they are 8-28 since the start of the 1994
season. The Yankees called off their home opener scheduled for
today because of a forecast calling for rain and cold. Rain is also
in the forecast Friday and Saturday in Cleveland, where the Rangers
are scheduled to open a three-game series against the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were 4-2 at Yankee Stadium in 1993, the only time in
club history they have had a winning record in a season in New
York. Since 1972, they are 53-106 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were 4-8 against the Yankees last year and were
outscored 76-47. That was the largest difference for the Rangers
against any team. They hit .246 against the Yankees, their lowest
average against any American League team. Catcher Ivan Rodriguez
hit .156 against the Yankees last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees went 3-3 on their opening road trip against the
Anaheim Angels and the Seattle Mariners. On Sunday, the Yankees
were stunned by the news that pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre has
multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Scott Brosius is on the disabled list with a
strained ribcage muscle. Rookie Alfonso Soriano, called up to
replace him, has two home runs and two errors in two games. Shane
Spencer had three home runs in the first five games but sat out
Sunday with a cut on his left middle finger. TOUGH OPPONENTS

EDITORIAL: BLAME IN THE CHINESE EMBASSY BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 11:
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after the American bombing of the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade during last spring's NATO air war against Yugoslavia,
the CIA has done its part to investigate and punish those who were
responsible for the disastrous mistake. The question now is whether
the Pentagon and NATO will look as squarely at their own role.
While the CIA made the pivotal error that misdirected the bombs,
military commanders failed to review the agency's target selection
adequately.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the CIA dismissed a mid-level officer whose error led
to the bombing. Six other agency employees received administrative
punishments. In disciplining these employees the director of
central intelligence, George J. Tenet, properly assigned
accountability within his agency.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing killed 3 Chinese and wounded 20. Officials at the
White House, the Pentagon and the CIA have maintained that it was
an accident, the result of a series of errors that flowed from the
use of an outdated map of Belgrade. The intended target was a
Yugoslav arms procurement agency. Instead the bombs hit the
embassy, several hundred yards away, though the site of the embassy
building was well known in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The officer who was dismissed last week apparently used a
year-old, unclassified military map to try to pinpoint the arms
agency's location. He also wrongly assumed that Belgrade's street
addresses were numbered uniformly. His chosen target was then
discussed during at least three meetings among CIA officials, none
of whom questioned his identification process. Instead they passed
it along to the Pentagon, which put it on the list of targets to
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   This is no way to pick a bombing target in the middle of a
crowded city. The CIA long ago gave up a central role in selecting
bombing targets for the Pentagon and was ill prepared to pick sites
on its own during the air war. Tenet said last week that the agency
``lacked formal procedures for preparing and forwarding target
nomination packages'' to the Pentagon. Normal vetting procedures by
the Pentagon and NATO were not applied.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing, which exploited the bombing to stir anti-American
sentiment in China, on Monday dismissed the CIA's disciplinary
actions as insufficient. That may play well in China, but it
reflects a stubborn refusal to believe that Washington may merely
have made a terrible mistake in picking the target. Tenet has had
the courage to admit his agency's errors and to hold individuals
accountable. The Pentagon should do the same.

WEEK 1 MIGHT BE A PRECURSOR TO WILD SEASON FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven games into the Rangers' season and this is what we have to
show for it: a 4-3 record, 22 home runs at The Ballpark, 50 runs
scored by the home team, a handful of flyballs and line drives lost
in the glare off the new Gold Club behind home plate, a serious
case of windburn, a Gold Glove first baseman in a huff and one
clubhouse scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Whew! Does that about sum it up?
</P>
<P>
   It was a fascinating first homestand for the Rangers, and the
storylines only get better from here. The Rangers are in New York
but what was supposed to be a three-game series has already been
whittled down to two games because of forecasted rain, snow and
cold.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your early-season pop quiz, boys. Here it comes.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake to read too much into such an early-season
meeting, especially now that it's two games, but it would be just
as wrong to think that whenever and wherever these two teams meet
isn't important to the psyche of the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not October, but it matters just the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you play the Yankees, you always want to show that
you can compete with them,'' general manager Doug Melvin said
yesterday before boarding the team's charter flight for New York.
``We haven't done that too well, especially in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to turn that around. There's been a gray cloud over
our head. We've been built for the long haul, but we know we have
to go through the Yankees at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin is hopeful that, with the many off-season changes the
Rangers made, this year's team won't be haunted by the playoff
failures of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees have been like a bad tee shot for us,'' Melvin
pointed out. ``You can go to your ball, thinking about what your
next shot is going to be, or you can get down and let it effect
you. I think we just have to put \Rwhat's happened with\R the
Yankees behind us, like a bad tee shot, and concentrate on our next
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, manager Johnny Oates, who stepped on the toes of his
star cleanup hitter, Rafael Palmeiro, by starting David Segui at
first on Opening Day, must now arbitrate a disagreement between
shortstop Royce Clayton and backup outfielder Chad Curtis, who
squared off in the Rangers' clubhouse Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   A witness to the confrontation between Clayton and Curtis said
it was over rap music with explicit lyrics that Clayton was playing
on the clubhouse stereo.
</P>
<P>
   According to a witness in the clubhouse at the time, Curtis,
never one to use diplomacy when a face-to-face confrontation is an
option (see Jeter, Derek, New York, and Belle, Albert, Cleveland),
objected to the music, and the two players exchanged shoves before
Palmeiro got between them.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said Oates is handling the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a club that some people think has been a bit
passive in the past,'' Melvin said. ``Maybe we've got a little bit
of fight now, if we can focus that on the field. Maybe we've been a
little boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's our job to make sure those things don't come
to a head and cause disruption, but maybe it's good that there's a
little spark in the clubhouse. We knew with some of the new guys
coming in, there would be some new energy in there.''
</P>
<P>
   No blood, no foul, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad Curtis has been known for that, being a spark plug,''
Melvin said. ``I don't encourage it, but if we have a problem early
on, it's time to say, `OK, we've got a few things here, let's get
'em ironed out. We're all in this thing together.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a little edge, let it be. If it gets disruptive or
becomes a distraction, it's my job and Johnny's job to do something
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only seven games, but already Melvin could point to
positive signs after the first Rangers' homestand:
</P>
<P>
   ``If people had questions about our offense, I think we've put
those to rest in most cases, unless we face David Wells too many
times. Besides that game, I think we got a good read on our offense
in that we're going to be able to produce runs up and down the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I'm a little surprised at the home runs we've hit and the
power we've shown. Maybe I shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our starting pitching will be better. It showed some signs of
coming around. We have to shut down the first-inning scoring
against us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are signs that the bullpen can be a strength,
just as we thought it would be. Johnny started defining the roles
out there, and that's good. I just got off the phone with a
National League team wanting to know if we'd part with anyone in
our bullpen. I said no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that our team hasn't given up. Even though
we've given up early runs in almost every game, we've come back.
And we're leading the league in double plays turned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A little edge, a little fight, isn't all bad.''
</P>
<P>
   A pillow fight would be more than what the Rangers have shown
against the Yankees the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   I say point Curtis at his old team and turn him loose. nn

REGINALD LAUBIN, INDIAN PLAINS DANCER, DIES AT 96

<P>
   Reginald Laubin, who performed dances of American Plains Indians
in the 1940s and '50s, died Wednesday at a hospital in Urbana, Ill.
He was 96 and lived in Urbana and in Moose, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Laubin nor his wife, Gladys, with whom he performed,
were Indian, but they studied Indian dance and culture with Sioux,
Crow, Cheyenne and other Plains Indians. The couple were adopted by
the Sioux and named Tatanka Wanjila (One Bull) and Wiyaka Wastewin
(Good Feather Woman). The two later lived with the Crow of Montana.
</P>
<P>
   The Laubins performed and gave lecture demonstrations throughout
the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are bringing to school, university, museum and concert
audiences not only the beaded costumes, the feathers and the
ceremonial paint of the Indians but also the Indian's character,
imagination, wisdom, dreams and hopes, given substance in dance,''
the critic Walter Terry wrote in a 1947 review. &UR;  &LR;  The Laubins were
known for respecting the complexity of the dances, which they
performed with authentic details at a time when American Indian
culture was seldom represented on concert stages with such dignity
or accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theoretically there is little to be said in defense of dancers
who go about doing `authentic' dances of other races,'' wrote John
Martin, the dance critic for The New York Times, in 1944. ``Why the
same indefensibility does not attach itself to the Laubins it would
be difficult to say, but it definitely does not.'' Though Laubin's
explanations of the dances were those of an outsider, Martin
continued, ``this air of the guide and interpreter falls away when
he dances and he simply presents the Indian in his own art.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1953 the Laubins took a company of nine Crow Indians on tour
in Europe, Algeria and Morocco, presenting what was believed to be
the first authentic Indian dance program performed there. Two years
later the couple established a summer festival of Indian arts near
their home in Jackson Hole, Wyo., where they performed for 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   They wrote three books, ``The Indian Tipi,'' ``Indian Dances of
North America'' and ``American Indian Archery,'' published by the
University of Oklahoma Press in 1957, 1977 and 1980, respectively.
They were also the subject of two films distributed by the
University of Oklahoma Press, ``Tipi How'' and ``Plains Indian
Culture with Reginald and Gladys Laubin.'' The couple received the
Capezio Award in 1972 for their contributions to American dance.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Laubin died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Laubin is survived by a sister, Magdalene Neff of Toledo, Ohio.

removed if the United States and the United Nations had the will to
do so. Last week, activists lobbied for sup port of Afghan women at

   ORPHANS (undated) _ Decades before political scandals cast a
shadow over Arizona at the end of the 20th century, a series of
events in Clifton-Morenci wrote an ugly chapter of the state's
history at the beginning of the century. It was a chapter full of
racism, anti-Catholic bigotry and orphans dickered over like dry
goods. University of Wisconsin historian Linda Gordon has
chronicled these events in her book, THE GREAT ARIZONA ORPHAN
ABDUCTION, a work rich in detail about the town and the scandal
that pitted Anglo residents against their Mexican-American
neighbors. By BARBARA YOST. Story will move in the ``E'' and ``L''

MILESTONE TARNISHED BY JOYLESS JUNIOR

   SEATTLE _ What number tells us more about Ken Griffey Jr.?
</P>
<P>
   Home run No. 400?
</P>
<P>
   Or jersey No. 24?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, history might tell us it was the No. 400.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Griffey became the youngest player in baseball to hit
400 homers, edging out Jimmie Foxx and sending the Cincinnati kid
on his way toward Hank Aaron on the all-time homer list.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this season, look for Griffey to pass Cal Ripken
(currently 403 career homers), Duke Snider (407), Darrell Evans
(414), Billy Williams (426), Andre Dawson (438), Dave Kingman (442)
and maybe Carl Yastrzemski (452), while Jose Canseco (431) and
Barry Bonds (447) are still chasing the fences, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, whatever glory there is in 400 homers and the
promise of many more to come, there is the stink of infamy in
Griffey's latest demand.
</P>
<P>
   After first handling the matter with class, Griffey now wants to
wear No. 24 _ Tony Perez's number in Cincinnati, not Griffey's.
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Jordan came back to basketball and decided to wear
No. 45, you knew it wasn't going to last.
</P>
<P>
   The number was a transient bit of business, one you almost
suspected Nike had put Jordan up to, just to ring up more $80
jersey sales.
</P>
<P>
   One bad playoff game against Orlando, though, and the next thing
you knew, Sir Air was flying high again in No. 23.
</P>
<P>
   As for Griffey, taking the No. 30 and slapping it on his back
was no goofy matter.
</P>
<P>
   No. 30 is Ken Griffey Sr.'s old number. It is a meaningful
number and a meaningful gesture.
</P>
<P>
   After all, after he cut the list of teams to which he would
agree to be traded from four to one, Griffey said his decision on
Cincinnati was ultimately about family, about wanting to be home.
</P>
<P>
   The trade he demanded to the Reds was very much about wanting to
play where his father played baseball, about wanting to play for
the same franchise that spawned the World Series-winning Big Red
Machine.
</P>
<P>
   And most important as to why Griffey settled on No. 30 was the
fact that Griffey's number from his 11 years with the Mariners was
not available.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, No. 24 is going to be retired by Cincinnati. This is
being done to honor Perez, who will be inducted into the Hall of
Fame this August.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Griffey promised to honor Perez's wish to keep that
number from being used. Griffey said it was the Big Dog's decision.
He wouldn't ask for it. He would consider using it if Perez
offered. Otherwise, no. Griffey was taking the high road.
</P>
<P>
   It was this sort of gesture that made it appear as if Griffey
were starting over in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   He was going to shed that sour and irritable skin that seemed to
have tightened on him his last year or so in Seattle, where it was
clear he wanted out, needed a change.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, nothing would faze him. Back home, it was all going
to be good. Back home, he was going to be happy, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   But already, after one pressure-filled opening week of poor
plate appearances and one ill-advised outburst about wanting his
No. 24 back, Griffey is back to projecting his familiar, joyless
self.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mariners understood how important it was to cut
Griffey loose, Griffey has had the luxury of a fresh start in a
town predisposed to loving him.
</P>
<P>
   This has seemed a perfect opportunity for Griffey to
re-establish himself not only as baseball's preeminent player but
also as baseball's pleasing, attractive marquee ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Although he would probably emphatically deny any responsibility
for why he is being perceived as spoiled and bratty and bending
under pressure, Griffey does seem to be squandering this chance.
</P>
<P>
   All the Pepsi commercials in the world aren't going to be able
to undo the uneasy image Griffey is more truthfully projecting in
more meaningful, public settings.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to the 1998 All-Star Game, when he refused to take
part in the home-run hitting contest. Although he felt under unfair
pressure to perform after an all-night flight and early morning
news conferences, Griffey had to be cajoled by baseball elders such
as Frank Robinson to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe when it came to getting out of Seattle, Griffey should
have demanded a trade to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   There, at least, Griffey had suggested that he and the current
owner of No. 24 had already struck a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey would get No. 24 and Wally Joyner would get a steak
dinner or a round of golf. Everyone would be happy. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the Griffey love affair in Cincinnati was damaged a
decade quicker than it took in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Mariner fans at Safeco Field were seen holding up
signs:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Who?''
</P>
<P>
   True, fans, like sportswriters, can be ridiculous, but there is
some element of relief that Griffey is gone, the team left behind
more amenable, more eager and open.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Cincinnati, before the Reds' first homestand
featuring Moeller High's own Ken Griffey Jr. was over, ``The Kid''
was up to his old tricks, making rash demands, prompting Reds
officials to come scurrying to the clubhouse to attempt to appease
him.
</P>
<P>
   For a player so young, with so far to go, with so many homers
and so many curtain calls left, it would be a shame if, during his
Hall of Fame induction, people shook their heads and said: ``If
only the guy had learned how to live up to all that natural beauty
and talent.''

METS' SHABBY PLAY HELPS PHILLIES WIN, 9-7 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ If Bobby J. Jones cannot be an effective starter
and Todd Zeile cannot make the transition to first base, the Mets
will be seriously hampered this season. Those two issues came
together in a troubling second inning of a 9-7 loss to the
Philadelphia Phillies Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored four runs in the first inning, and the Phillies,
playing their home opener, looked awful. Many in the Veterans
Stadium crowd of 47,115 booed as the Phillies misjudged fly balls,
leading to four Mets doubles.
</P>
<P>
   But the Phillies soon benefited from the Mets' shabby play.
Jones allowed three singles and a run to open the second inning,
then issued a walk to load the bases. Another run scored on a
fielder's choice, bringing up pitcher Paul Byrd, who pushed a bunt
toward Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, a converted third baseman who had made a throwing error
and an error attempting to catch a pop-up this season, was in
position to field the bunt. But he let the ball skip through his
legs, and a third run scored.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Doug Glanville, doubled high off the wall in
left-center, tying the score. A sacrifice fly brought in Byrd and
gave the Phillies a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   If the inning was worrisome because of what it might say about
the rest of the season, it was also ominous for the later innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets chased Byrd with four consecutive hits to start the
fifth. The first was a single by Rickey Henderson, who stole second
and scored on a double by Jon Nunnally. The run was Henderson's
second of the game; the 41-year-old leadoff man wants to set the
career record for runs scored but had not scored this season before
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   A double by Edgardo Alfonzo and a single by Mike Piazza gave the
Mets another lead, 7-5, and put Jones in position for a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had worked 1-2-3 innings in the third and fourth, but he
ran into trouble when he encountered Glanville again leading off
the fifth. Glanville stroked a double to left, and Ron Gant
followed with an opposite-field double to right, scoring Glanville.
</P>
<P>
   That was it for Jones, who was relieved by Rich Rodriguez. After
a walk and a strikeout, Rodriguez allowed a sacrifice fly to tie
the score. Then he faced Mike Lieberthal, who made the All-Star
team last season en route to a career-high 31 homers. Lieberthal
was searching for his first home run this season, and he got it,
belting Rodriguez's second pitch deep into the left-field seats to
give the Phillies a 9-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Things could have gotten much worse for the Mets an inning
later. With one out, Kevin Sefcik tripled to right center, chasing
Rodriguez (0-1) from the game. Turk Wendell entered, and got
Glanville to fly out to shallow center.
</P>
<P>
   Sefcik decided to test Nunnally's arm, but the throw was
accurate, if short. It bounced off the turf and into the mitt of
Mike Piazza, who braced for a collision as Sefcik barreled home.
Sefcik plowed into Piazza with his right shoulder, knocking Piazza
onto his back and sending the trainer Fred Hina and manager Bobby
Valentine racing from the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Sefcik was out and Piazza was fine, if winded. He lay on the
dirt for a moment before rising and returning to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The game featured a matchup of starting pitchers who figure to
be crucial to their teams' success this year. The Mets have a good
idea of what to expect from their top three starters, but are less
sure about Jones, who made only nine starts last year in a season
cut short by shoulder problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' first start of the season did not go well; he lost to San
Diego last week and allowed four runs on six hits while failing to
get out of the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Phillies' rotation starts off strong, with Curt
Schilling (who threw 63 pitches on a minor league rehab assignment
Monday night and is expected back from shoulder surgery next month)
and Andy Ashby. One of their biggest questions is whether Byrd, a
former Met, will pitch as he did in the first half of last season,
when he went 11-5 and made the All-Star team, or the second half,
when he was 4-6.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd allowed six runs in two-thirds of an inning in his first
start this year, and he allowed seven runs in four and a third
innings Monday night. Reliever Amaury Telemaco pitched an inning
and two-thirds and was credited with the victory.
